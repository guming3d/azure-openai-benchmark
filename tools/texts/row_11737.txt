article: As the most popular search engine in the world, Google has its fair share of web competitors eager to find a flaw in the company's online make-up. So the need for a whiz-hacker, trained in batting off threats from billions of criminals, has never been so big. The woman in charge of such tasks is 31-year-old Parisa Tabriz - head of security at Google Chrome. Scroll down for video . Tabriz leads a team of 30 engineers tasked with securing the most widely used web browser in the world, Google Chrome . Tabriz gave herself the title of 'Security Princess' while on a conference in Tokyo . As one of the few women in such coveted roles within the company, the Iranian-American has aptly chosen the title Security Princess. 'I thought Information Security Engineer sounded so boring. Guys in the industry all take it so seriously, so security princess felt suitably whimsical,' she told the Telegraph. Born to an Iranian father and Polish mother, Ms Tabriz grew up in Chicago with her two younger brothers. Surprisingly, she didn't own her first computer until her first at the University of Illinois where she studied computer engineering. When she's not at work, Tabriz enjoys making gelato, blowing glass and amateur photography . Not just a big brain: Tabriz also enjoys rock climbing near Google's campus in Mountain View, California . Tabriz manages a team of 30 security experts throughouth Europe and Google's campus in Mountain View, California (pictured) After graduating in 2007, Ms Tabriz started working at Google straight away and in 2012 was listed in Forbes Magazine's 30 people under 30 to watch in the technology industry. Among her daily tasks at Google is giving seminars to less experienced 'white hat hackers', working to protect the search engine. In her first class, she asks students how they would hack into a vending machine for chocolate without using technology. And while hacking may seem like a dark-art carried out by society's trolls, Miss Tabriz insists there is a more moralistic side to her role. Speaking of the person responsible for stealing and leaking nude celebrity photographs, she said: 'What he did was not only a violation of these women but it was criminal, and as a hacker I was very saddened by it. 'I feel like we, the hackers, need better PR to show we're not all like that.' Google offers cash rewards of up to $30,000 for tips about bugs on Chrome. To date, the company has paid up $1.25 million to fix more than 700 issues with the web.

chatgpt: Parisa Tabriz, a 31-year-old information security engineer, has become a trailblazer in the tech industry as a top hacker and computer security expert. Her unique job is to attack Google Chrome, the most popular internet browser, in order to find any potential weaknesses or vulnerabilities before cybercriminals have a chance to exploit them. Tabriz's job at Google is a critical one, as cyber attacks are becoming increasingly common and sophisticated. With her team, she spends much of her time trying to think like the bad guys, imagining ways they could infiltrate Google's systems and steal user data. Despite the seriousness of her work, Tabriz has a playful side. She prefers to call herself the "Security Princess" rather than an information security engineer, a moniker that reflects her confidence and fearlessness in a male-dominated field. Tabriz's rise to the top of the tech industry has been a remarkable one, particularly as women remain vastly underrepresented in the field. She studied computer science at the University of Illinois before joining Google as a software engineer. From there, she moved into the security field, quickly rising through the ranks to become one of the most respected experts in the game. Tabriz has received numerous accolades for her work, including Fortune's "40 under 40" list of the most influential young people in business, and Time's "30 Most Influential People on the Internet." But despite her success, she remains humble about her achievements. In a recent interview, Tabriz said that the key to her success has been her ability to think creatively and her willingness to take risks. "You have to be comfortable going into the unknown," she said. "There's no way to know what's going to happen when you're hacking a system. You just have to trust yourself and your abilities." Tabriz's work is critical in a world where cyber attacks are on the rise, and businesses must remain constantly vigilant to protect themselves and their customers. Thanks to her efforts, Google Chrome remains one of the most secure internet browsers on the market, with vulnerabilities identified and addressed before they can be exploited. As for Tabriz, she has no plans to slow down anytime soon. In addition to her work at Google, she also spends time mentoring other women in the tech industry, hoping to inspire the next generation of "Security Princesses" to follow in her footsteps. With her innovative approach and her commitment to the field, there's no doubt Tabriz will continue to be a force to be reckoned with for years to come.
