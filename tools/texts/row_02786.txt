article: A senior NHS children’s brain doctor exposed as a cocaine user by The Mail on Sunday has been arrested on suspicion of being involved in the supply of Class A drugs. Inquiries into paediatric neurologist Dr Colin Ferrie began last month after the MoS printed photos taken from a video appearing to show Ferrie snorting cocaine and swallowing the ‘date rape’ drug GHB, just before going on call. On Wednesday morning, the consultant was arrested at his home near Bradford and taken to Leeds police headquarters for questioning. Exposed: Dr Colin Ferrie, pictured in a still from the video, has been arrested on suspicion of being involved in the supply of Class A drugs . Officers also searched his house and his office at Leeds General Infirmary. Detective Superintendent Pat Twiggs, head of crime for Leeds District, said: ‘A 51-year-old man, from Baildon, was arrested as part of an investigation into potential drugs offences following an article in a national Sunday newspaper about a member of staff at Leeds General Infirmary. ‘He was subsequently released on police bail pending further inquiries.’ Dr Ferrie, 51, is being investigated by the same police team that looked into the drug-taking of former Co-Op Bank chairman Rev Paul Flowers, following our exposure of his secret life in November 2013. Inquiries into Ferrie began last month after the Mail on Sunday printed photos taken from a video appearing to show the paediatric neurologist snorting cocaine and taking 'date rape' drug GHB . Flowers was convicted and fined £525 after he admitted possession of cocaine, crystal meth and ketamine. Leeds Infirmary has suspended Dr Ferrie and the General Medical Council has withdrawn his registration, meaning he cannot practice as a doctor. Last night Mr Ferrie’s lawyer said: ‘Dr Colin Ferrie is co-operating with the West Yorkshire Police investigation. He has no further comment to make.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

chatgpt: Dr Colin Ferrie, a prominent children's brain doctor, has been arrested on suspicion of his involvement in the supply of Class As. The arrest follows revelations in the Mail on Sunday that Dr Ferrie had been using cocaine. The newspaper had obtained stills from a video, which appeared to show him snorting the drug and taking GHB.  Dr Ferrie was arrested at his home near Bradford earlier this week and taken in for questioning. Officers also searched his house and his office at Leeds General Infirmary. The investigation is still ongoing, and no charges have been filed against Dr Ferrie at this time. The news of Dr Ferrie's arrest has sent shockwaves through the medical community, as well as among his patients and their parents. Dr Ferrie is a highly respected doctor, known for his work in treating children with brain injuries and conditions such as epilepsy. The General Medical Council, which regulates doctors in the UK, has been made aware of Dr Ferrie's arrest and is currently reviewing the case. A spokesperson for the GMC stated that "the GMC does not tolerate any behavior that brings the medical profession into disrepute" and that "any allegations of this nature are taken very seriously." Dr Ferrie's colleagues at Leeds General Infirmary have also expressed their shock and concern. Dr Ferrie's arrest has raised questions about the recruitment and vetting process for healthcare professionals. Hospitals and medical centers are responsible for carrying out background checks on doctors before offering them employment, including checks on their criminal history and drug use. The investigation into Dr Ferrie's alleged involvement in the supply of Class As is ongoing, and more details are expected to emerge in the coming weeks. In the meantime, patients and families who have received treatment from Dr Ferrie are being encouraged to seek advice and support from their healthcare providers.
