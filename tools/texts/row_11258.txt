Unexpected: Meaghan was a healthy five-year-old, but she died at her school after choking on a pin . Meaghan's family and teachers had been at a loss to explain how the healthy and cheerful child had suddenly become ill and died on December 12 last year. Her class had been in the school library when Meaghan approached a teacher with her hands clutched around her neck. The teacher quickly took her to the nurse's office, but Meaghan collapsed in the school hallway before they could get there. Once she had been carried inside, an oxygen tank the nurse used to try to revive her allegedly malfunctioned, spraying a caustic chemical over the nurse who had to be taken to hospital, according to the Dallas Observer. 'We were praying; we were talking to her, whispering in her ear, and just begging her to hold on,' Meaghan's aunt, Erika Kennedy said.

Shortly after Meaghan's death her school held a 'pink out' where the campus was decorated with pink ribbons and classmates wore pink in memory of the little girl. However, family spokesman Daryl Kevin Washington said they believe if the oxygen tank had worked, Meaghan could have been saved. 'We know and we believe that would have played an important role in saving Meaghan's life,' he said. Meaghan's family hope the little girl's death will bring changes to the school, including a ban on pushpins, CPR training for all teachers, and better checks to ensure medical equipment is working.
