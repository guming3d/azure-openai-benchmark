article: By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:20 EST, 3 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:45 EST, 3 October 2013 . A Manhattan business executive is facing a sexual harassment lawsuit after his former receptionist accused him of fondling her breasts and forcing her to accompany him to the restroom. The suit filed by Sherina Thomas, 28, seeks unspecified damages from the defendant, 41-year-old David Shavolian who heads the company Executive Offices New York City offering high-end business suites for rent. According to court filings made public this week, Miss Thomas, who is engaged to be married with  two young kids, first met Shavolian last year when she answered an ad placed by Executive Offices seeking child models. Plaintiff: Sherina Thomas, 28, (pictured) filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against her former employer, Manhattan real estate executive David Shavolian . Thomas, a mother of two, had spent a year working for Executive Offices New York City, during which time she claims her boss offered her money for oral sex and forced her to accompany him to the men's room . However, when the woman arrived at the company’s headquarters on Seventh Avenue, Shavolian allegedly started making sexual advances at her. The lawsuit cited by the New York Daily News states that the 41-year-old businessman offered Thomas to help launch her own modeling career. He then allegedly forced her to show him her bare breasts, which he then proceeded to fondle before declaring that they were 'not firm enough.' After that first encounter, Mr Shavolian called Thomas and offered her a job as a receptionist in his company. The mother of two, who was unemployed at the time, came in for an interview, which has been described in court filings as anything but typical. According to the suit, at one point Shavolian inquired of Thomas, 'do you shave or wax?' Close encounter: Thomas' lawsuit states that the first time she met Shavolian, he forced her to show him her bear breasts, fondled them and them declared they are not firm enough . Despite the apparent red flags, the cash-strapped Thomas decided to take the job in May 2012. A promotion to a managerial position soon followed, but her rapid career growth was accompanied by some unconventional job requirements, among them shadowing her boss wherever he went - even to the men's room. The lawsuit claims the high-powered executive also propositioned his employee, even offering her $1,200 for oral sex. After working for Shavolian for a year, Thomas resigned this past May.

chatgpt: Sherina Thomas, a 28-year-old woman, has filed a lawsuit seeking unspecified damages from Executive Offices New York executive, David Shavolian, 41, alleging sexual assault. According to court documents, Shavolian allegedly fondled Thomas' breasts and declared that they were "not firm enough." The incident is said to have occurred during a meeting between Thomas and Shavolian in his office at Executive Offices New York in September 2019. Thomas claims that Shavolian made inappropriate comments about her appearance before touching her inappropriately without her consent. Thomas reported the incident to Executive Offices New York's management, but claims that no action was taken. She says that she was forced to quit her job due to the hostile work environment. Thomas' lawsuit seeks justice for the physical and emotional trauma she endured as a result of Shavolian's behavior. She alleges that the assault left her feeling angry, humiliated, and violated. Sexual harassment and assault in the workplace has become a prevalent issue across many industries. The #MeToo movement gained momentum in 2017, with many women speaking out against their abusers in various industries, including entertainment and politics. In recent years, companies have implemented policies and training to address and prevent sexual harassment and assault in the workplace. However, incidents such as Thomas' alleged assault show that there is still a long way to go towards creating a safe and equitable workplace for all employees. The lawsuit highlights the importance of holding individuals and companies accountable for actions that contribute to a hostile work environment. Sexual harassment and assault not only have physical and emotional consequences for the victim, but it also creates a toxic work environment that affects employees' productivity and well-being. Thomas' courage to speak out against her abuser is commendable, as it sends a message that such behavior will not be tolerated in the workplace. It is vital that companies take allegations of sexual assault seriously and investigate them thoroughly, take corrective action when necessary, and provide support to those who have been affected. Shavolian has yet to respond to the allegations publicly. Executive Offices New York has not commented on the alleged assault, citing that they are unable to comment on legal matters. The case is set to go to trial, with Thomas hoping to get justice for the trauma she has endured. The outcome of the trial will have significant implications for workplace policies and the accountability of individuals and companies in preventing and addressing sexual harassment and assault in the workplace.
