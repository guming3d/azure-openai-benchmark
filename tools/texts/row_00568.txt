chatgpt: Former American football player and actor OJ Simpson has been nominated as a finalist for the Rose Bowl Game All-Century Class. This comes after his impressive performances in the prestigious annual college football game in 1968 and 1969. Despite his remarkable achievements, Simpson is currently serving a minimum nine-year sentence for his involvement in armed robbery and kidnapping.  Simpson began his football career at the University of Southern California (USC), where he was awarded the Heisman Trophy for his exceptional skill and talent on the field. His outstanding performances led him to be drafted by the Buffalo Bills in 1969, where he went on to have a successful career in the National Football League (NFL).  One of Simpson's most notable football moments was his participation in the Rose Bowl Game in 1968 and 1969 during his time at USC. The annual college football game is one of the most prestigious events in football history, and being a finalist for the All-Century Class is a great accomplishment.  However, Simpson's public image took a hit in the mid-1990s when he was accused and charged with the double murder of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ron Goldman. Despite being found not guilty of the criminal charges, Simpson lost a civil lawsuit that held him liable for the deaths of the two individuals.  In 2008, Simpson was involved in an armed robbery and kidnapping case in Las Vegas, leading to his current imprisonment. Although he has been eligible for parole in the past, his release has been denied due to his past criminal record and the severity of the crimes he has committed.  Simpson's nomination as a finalist for the Rose Bowl Game All-Century Class has stirred up mixed reactions among football enthusiasts and the public, with some arguing that his past criminal activities should not in any way be associated with his football achievements. Others, however, believe that Simpson should not be celebrated in light of his actions both on and off the field.  Regardless of the various opinions, Simpson's football career remains an important part of American football history. His nomination as a finalist for the Rose Bowl Game All-Century Class recognizes his contribution to the sport and his outstanding achievements during his time at USC. It remains to be seen whether he will be inducted into the All-Century Class, considering his current imprisonment and the controversies surrounding his past.
