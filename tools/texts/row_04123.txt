article: Hong Kong (CNN) -- A member of the Japanese doomsday cult responsible for the 1995 nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway has been arrested after 17 years on the run, Tokyo police say. Naoko Kikuchi, 40, a follower of the Aum Supreme Truth Cult, was apprehended in the town of Sagamihara, a quiet residential area approximately 40 km west of the Japanese capital after a local resident tipped off police. During a rush-hour attack on the morning of March, 20 1995, cult members released sarin gas that led to the death of 13 people and sickened more than 5,500 commuters. Kikuchi has admitted to helping make the gas, which attacks the central nervous system, but was not aware how it would be used, Tokyo Metropolitan Police said. She was arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder. Before her arrest, she was living in a small, shabby house made out of rusted metal panels, local TV footage showed. Another resident, a 41-year-old man, was arrested for allegedly hiding the suspect. Police were tipped off early Sunday morning and made their arrest when Kikuchi returned home in the evening. They had recently doubled the reward available for information related to the suspects' whereabouts to 10 million yen ($125,000). Kikuchi was one of two remaining cult members wanted for their involvement in one of the most shocking acts of terrorism in Japan's history.

Another cult member Makoto Hirata, wanted for the murder of a notary official, unexpectedly turned himself in on New Year's Eve, stunning many in Japan. More than 200 members of the cult were convicted in the wake of the gas attack and 13, including Shoko Asahara, the cult's blind guru, were sentenced to death. However, no one has been executed. The cult now claims to be a benign religious group but at the height of its activities in the 1990s, it preached the world was coming to an end and that it must arm itself to prepare for various calamities. It had stockpiled weapons and the gas attack was part of what the group thought was an apocalyptic showdown with the government. CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki in Tokyo contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Naoko Kikuchi, one of the last remaining fugitives from the 1995 Tokyo subway gas attack, has been arrested in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. Kikuchi had been on the run for almost 17 years after the attack carried out by the Aum Shinrikyo cult, which killed 13 people and injured more than 5,000. Kikuchi was a member of the cult and played a key role in the production of the deadly sarin gas used in the attack. The cult believed in a doomsday scenario and that only their leader could save them. The attack was carried out in an attempt to bring about this apocalyptic scenario and to incite fear among the Japanese population. According to police sources, Kikuchi has admitted to assisting in the production of the gas and stated that she believed the attack was necessary to fulfill the cult's beliefs. She had been living in hiding under a false identity in the city of Sagamihara, where she was finally caught. The arrest of Kikuchi marks the end of a long and winding investigation that has spanned nearly two decades. Of the 189 cult members arrested in connection with the attack, 13, including the founder and leader of the cult, Shoko Asahara, were sentenced to death, while seven were given life sentences. Despite the swift and harsh punishment handed down to the perpetrators, the attack has left a deep scar on Japan's psyche. The incident forced the country to confront its lack of preparedness for such an event and spurred on a substantial overhaul of its security measures.

Many have urged the authorities to ensure that those responsible for the attack are held accountable and that Japan's safety and security measures remain stringent and up to date. In conclusion, this arrest brings closure to a case that has haunted Japan for more than 20 years. It serves as a reminder of the lasting impact that terrorist attacks can leave, and highlights the importance of ensuring that those responsible are brought to justice. The arrest of Naoko Kikuchi is a crucial step towards healing and moving on from this dark chapter in Japan's history.
