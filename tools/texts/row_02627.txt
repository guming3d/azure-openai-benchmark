article: Kano, Nigeria (CNN) -- Boko Haram insurgents killed 35 people in coordinated early morning raids on three villages in Nigeria's northeastern state of Borno, a military source and residents said, the latest deadly attacks by the militant group. Dozens of Boko Haram gunmen dressed in military uniforms raided Gumushi, Amuda and Arbokko Wednesday in all-terrain vans and on motorcycles, opening fire on residents and torching homes with Molotov cocktails. At least 26 people were killed in Gumushi alone, a military officer in Maiduguri said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about the incidents. "The insurgents hurled petrol bombs into homes, setting them ablaze and shot residents as they tried to escape," said the army officer about the 6 a.m. raid. Attacks on the neighboring farm villages of Amuda and Arbokko earlier, around 2 a.m., left nine people dead and several homes destroyed. Arbokko resident Josiah Ali said people were asleep when Boko Haram struck. "The gunmen fired at people as they rushed out of their homes in a bid to escape," Ali said. Thirteen people were seriously injured in the attack in Amuda, resident Pirda Takweshe said. Borno state police commissioner Lawan Tanko confirmed the attacks, but did not give details on casualties. Monday, Boko Haram stormed a military base and a police station in Yobe state, also in the northeast, security sources said. The attacks in the town of Buni Yadi left 18 soldiers and 15 police officers dead, the sources said. The group has stepped up its deadly raids on villages in Borno state in recent months. Boko Haram, which means "western education is a sin," is still holding more than 200 girls it abducted last month from a school in Chibok, also in Borno state. The militant group says its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south.

chatgpt: In the latest series of attacks by Boko Haram, at least 35 people have been killed as militants targeted villages in northeast Nigeria. According to local reports, this violent extremist group targeted homes and threw Molotov cocktails there while shooting residents who attempted to escape. These attacks took place in a time when Nigeria is already struggling with insecurity due to rising numbers of banditry, kidnappings, and ethno-religious violence. This has led to a lack of confidence in the government's ability to protect people. The group responsible for such attacks is Boko Haram, which has been operating in Nigeria for over a decade. The group is responsible for several attacks on civilians, government officials, and military targets. After claiming responsibility for the Chibok schoolgirl kidnappings in 2014, Boko Haram's activities have drawn international attention. Despite efforts by the Nigerian government and its foreign partners to curb the group's activities, including the establishment of the Multi-National Joint Task Force in 2015, the situation remains challenging. Currently, the group still holds more than 200 schoolgirls it abducted in April 2014. The situation in Nigeria's northeast continues to deteriorate, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to manage. Even with the government's emphasis on attaining peace in the region, it does not seem to work. The fear of brutal death and kidnapping looms over every corner of the Northeast of Nigeria, and the current state raises concerns about the safety of at-risk areas. In conclusion, it is essential that the Nigerian government puts more effort into protecting its citizens, particularly in the northeast of the country. With continuous Boko Haram attacks, civilians are becoming increasingly vulnerable and more lives are being lost. The government must protect innocent people from these fanatics who hide behind their perverse beliefs to hurt and kill innocent Nigerians.
