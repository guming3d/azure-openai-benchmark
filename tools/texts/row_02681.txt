article: Bayern Munich joined fellow German side Borussia Dortmund in the final of the European Champions League by completing a crushing 7-0 aggregate win over Barcelona in the Nou Camp Wednesday. Leading 4-0 from the semifinal first leg in the Allianz Arena, Bayern ruthlessly pulled apart a Barcelona side missing their talisman Lionel Messi, who sat out the second leg on the bench. After a goalless first half, a fine Arjen Robben strike, a Gerard Pique own goal and a Thomas Mueller header ended any lingering hopes of a Barca comeback in a 3-0 victory for the visitors. Home coach Tito Vilanova decided against risking his star asset Messi despite him scoring in the weekend win over Athletic Bilbao. Messi injured his hamstring in their quarterfinal tie against Paris St Germain and has been nursing the problem the last few weeks, cutting an often forlorn figure in Munich in the first leg. Without his creative influence, the La Liga champions in waiting were first kept in check then dismantled by a Bayern side reaching their third Champions League final in the past four years. The previous two appearances have seen defeat to Inter Milan in 2010 and Chelsea last year but they will start favorites at Wembley on May 25 against Dortmund. With the Bundesliga title already wrapped up and an appearance in the German Cup final against Stuttgart on June 1, coach Jupp Heynckes will be looking to sign off as Bayern coach with a treble triumph. Former Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola takes over at Bayern next season, doubtless relishing the task on the evidence of their comprehensive defeat of his former charges in the semifinal. Robben came close to breaking the deadlock in the first half, but delayed his shot. When given a second chance just after the break the Dutch international, a former Real Madrid player, cut inside to beat Valdes with a curling shot. Franck Ribery set up the further goals, first bursting clear down the left in the 72nd minute to see his cross turned clumsily into his own net by Pique. Four minutes later a similar run left Mueller to head home at the far post and complete the rout. All the time Messi sat glumly on the bench as the task became hopeless even for his genius. Teammate Pique reflected on one of the worst reverses in the history of a proud club. "Perhaps it was the bitterest night I have had at Barcelona," he told  Spanish Canal Plus television. "We tried but they scored a goal very early in the second half and this  left us broken. The last 25 minutes were very difficult." Robben, by contrast, is already looking forward to the final against their arch German rivals. "To win 4-0 and 3-0 away, especially the 3-0 here, it is amazing," he told Sky Sports. "Now we are in the final for the third time in four years and it is time to win this thing now."

chatgpt: Bayern Munich advanced to the Champions League final on Wednesday with a convincing 3-0 victory over Barcelona at Camp Nou, following their 4-0 victory in the first-leg. The 7-0 aggregate success ensured that Barcelona's miserable week following their domestic title loss was compounded, and it marks the first time since 1999 that Barcelona have been kept without a goal over two legs in the Champions League. Bayern Munich started off strong in the first half, with Arjen Robben putting them in the lead in the 48th minute. Robben, who had given Barcelona problems in the first leg, scored after a brilliant run and finish, which goalkeeper Victor Valdes could not stop. Barcelona had a chance to equalize when they were awarded a penalty in the 49th minute, but Thomas Muller had his effort saved by Valdes. Muller, however, made up for his miss in the second half, scoring Bayern’s second goal in the 76th minute. It was a deserved goal for the Bayern forward, who had given Barcelona’s defenders trouble all game with his runs and work rate. Barcelona’s misery was compounded when Gerard Pique scored an own goal in the 80th minute, rounding off a comprehensive victory for Bayern Munich. The third goal was no more than Bayern deserved, after they dominated the match and put Barcelona under pressure throughout the game. Barcelona managed to bring Lionel Messi off the bench in the second half, but the Argentine did not have much impact on the game, which was already out of their hands by that point. Messi, who had been struggling with a hamstring injury, was named as a substitute for the match, but manager Tito Vilanova opted to keep him on the bench. Bayern Munich’s victory sets up a mouth-watering all-Bundesliga final against Borussia Dortmund on May 25th, which will be played at Wembley Stadium in London. It will be the first time that a Champions League final features two teams from the same country, and Bayern will be looking to avenge their defeat in last year’s final to Chelsea. Overall, Bayern Munich’s victory was well-deserved, as they outplayed, out-thought and outworked Barcelona in both legs. Bayern’s teamwork was superb, as they pressed Barcelona high up the pitch, controlled possession, and defended resolutely when necessary. Barcelona, however, will be disappointed with their performance, as they failed to create many good chances, and their defense was often caught out of position. It was an uncharacteristically poor performance from Barcelona, who are used to dominating opponents with their possession-based football. In the end, it was a historic victory for Bayern Munich, who have been the standout team in Europe this season. They will be hoping to end their season with a treble, as they are already crowned champions in the Bundesliga, and will face Stuttgart in the DFB-Pokal final on June 1st. The stage is set for an epic end to a thrilling season.
