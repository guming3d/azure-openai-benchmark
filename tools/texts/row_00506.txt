The New Jersey Turnpike Authority wants a Florida pizza shop to pay a big toll for using a logo similar to the Garden State Parkway's green and yellow signs. The agency sued Jersey Boardwalk Pizza, which is 1,300 miles from New Jersey, Tuesday in federal court over the logo it uses for its two pizza shops and on merchandise sold online.

'Given the very distinct difference in the goods and services offered by our respective clients (yours being a governmental agency providing highway maintenance and travel related services exclusively in the state of New Jersey — ours being a franchisor of pizza restaurants providing the opportunity to provide delicious pizza and Italian food to patrons of its licensed restaurants), there is no plausible likelihood of confusion,' she wrote. The turnpike authority sued over two logos, one used by the pizza business and one by a franchising business it owns. Kenny said that logo for the restaurants was approved by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and has been used since April 2011.

chatgpt: In an unusual legal battle, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority has registered a complaint against a beloved pizza restaurant, Jersey Boardwalk Pizza, alleging that its logo may be too similar to the traffic signs that are used by the state agency. The New Jersey Turnpike Authority, which creates and maintains the signage for the major highways in New Jersey, has claimed that Jersey Boardwalk Pizza is using a logo that resembles the green and yellow signs that are prominently displayed on the Garden State Parkway. In response to the lawsuit, the owner of Jersey Boardwalk Pizza, Skip Parratt, has expressed confusion and amusement. He stated that he does not understand how his pizza logo, which features a slice of pizza topped with various ingredients and the letters 'JBP,' is in any way similar to the highway sign of the New Jersey Turnpike Authority. The lawsuit alleges that the similarity between the two logos is causing confusion for drivers who may mistake the pizza logo for the official New Jersey Turnpike Authority sign. This could potentially lead to accidents or other complications on the highway. However, Parratt has argued that the only confusion that could arise is for someone who is "hysterical" and "driving too quickly," and that the restaurant's logo is well-loved by locals who appreciate the restaurant's pizza and hospitality. "I don't see how any reasonable person could confuse our pizza logo with a highway sign," Parratt said in a statement. "It's just absurd." Jersey Boardwalk Pizza has been a staple of New Jersey cuisine for decades, known for its thin-crust pies with a variety of toppings. Many residents of the state have fond memories of visiting the restaurant after a long day at the beach, or on their way home from work. The New Jersey Turnpike Authority has not specified what it wants the pizza restaurant to do regarding its logo. However, the lawsuit seeks an injunction against the pizzeria and asks for damages for alleged violations of the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's intellectual property. This lawsuit is just the latest in a series of legal battles involving trademark infringement and intellectual property. In recent years, there have been high-profile lawsuits involving companies such as Apple, Samsung, and Nike. For now, it remains unclear how the battle between the New Jersey Turnpike Authority and Jersey Boardwalk Pizza will play out. However, it seems likely that the case will generate significant public interest, as many New Jersey residents have fond memories of this beloved pizzeria and may find the lawsuit to be unwarranted.
