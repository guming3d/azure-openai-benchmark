article: By . Charlotte Kemp . It’s the moment of truth and I hardly dare draw breath as I yank the zip to the top. I’ve just squeezed myself into an unbelievably tight flamingo-pink dress, but the contortion involved was worth it — I look like a different person. My anything but pneumatic 41-year-old curves have been sculpted into the perfect hourglass shape and I can see my waist for the first time in years. Better still, all this has been achieved for less than £90, thanks to a forthcoming collection for Banana Republic by Roland Mouret. He was behind the Galaxy dress — the figure-hugging £1,000 number that spawned thousands of copies, was named ‘dress of the decade’ and became a worldwide sell-out in 2006. Celebrity devotees including Cameron Diaz and Victoria Beckham raved about the miraculous fit. Until now, with most of his designs costing well over £1,000, we mortals had to make do with cheap High Street imitations. Not for long: using a thick fabric made from cotton, viscose and Spandex, he claims he’s been able to achieve his trademark curve-creating cling at a price we can all afford.
