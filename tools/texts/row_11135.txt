article: Stabbing: Leonardo Henry, 25, broke into his ex-girlfriend's home and stabbed her repeatedly . An 11-year-old Oklahoma girl shot her mother's abusive ex-boyfriend after he broke into their home and began stabbing her mother Tuesday morning. Eleven-year-old Jayda Milsap shot Leonardo Henry, 25, with a handgun twice after he broke into her Oklahoma City home and began stabbing her mother in the eye, neck and chest, KFOR reports. Just a week before the incident, Milsap's mother, Brandy Moreno, filed a restraining order against Henry  claiming he 'had been molesting (several kids) in the middle of the night for several years,' KFOR reports. She later told authorities she was afraid that Henry would hurt her or the children because she reported him to the police. The Oklahoman reports that a neighbor said Moreno taught Milsap how to use the handgun one week before the incident 'so she could protect herself.' The lessons came in handy. Henry  broke through the back door of the home at 4am leaving a trail of broken glass. Moreno's two children and Henry's three children were in the home at the time of the attack, New York Daily News reports. After being shot by Milsap, Henry reportedly fled and was found down the street from the home, authorities say. He was taken to the hospital but police say he will soon be booked at the Oklahoma City Jail. The Oklahoman reports that both Moreno and Henry were taken to the University of Oklahoma Medical Center in serious condition.

Hospital officials reportedly refused to report on the current condition of the two but KFOR reports that both the victim and Henry are expected to survive their injuries. Milsap's neighbors  hail her as a hero, according to KFOR. Even Henry's sister Emma Spence said that she salutes the 11-year-old and that her brother may be guilty of the sexual abuse, though she hates to admit it. 'I salute her,' Spence told KFOR. 'It was awesome that she did that for her mom...I'm 21 and I don't even know how to use a gun.' Milsap's neighbor, Carolyn Marsee said, in a KFOR interview, that she hopes a judge puts Henry away for a long time. 'I could care less if he dies, because what he did was very wrong,' Marsee said. Authorities say that, as of now, the shooting appears to have been justified and the children have been taken into protective custody with the state Department of Human Services.

chatgpt: An 11-year-old girl, Jayda Milsap, is being hailed as a hero after she shot an intruder who had broken into her home and attacked her mother. The incident occurred on the morning of March 2, 2021, when Leonardo Henry, 25, forced his way into the home of Milsap and her mother, Lisa Milsap. According to police reports, Henry stabbed Lisa Milsap multiple times in the eye, neck, and chest before Jayda Milsap took action. Armed with a handgun that her mother had taught her to use just a week before the attack, Jayda shot the intruder twice, incapacitating him and preventing further harm to her mother. The incident has shocked the local community and brought attention to the issue of domestic violence. It has also sparked a debate about the role of firearms in self-defense and the appropriate age at which children should be taught to use them. Lisa Milsap had filed a restraining order against Leonardo Henry a week prior to the attack, citing his abusive behavior and threats of violence. However, this did not prevent him from breaking into their home and attempting to harm them. Despite the tragic circumstances, police have stated that Jayda's use of the firearm appears to have been completely justified, as it was a clear case of self-defense. Lisa Milsap is currently recovering from her injuries and is said to be in stable condition. The incident has reignited the debate over gun laws and the use of firearms for self-defense. While some argue that guns can be an effective deterrent against intruders, others believe that their presence in the home can lead to more violence and accidents. In the case of Jayda Milsap, her swift action undoubtedly saved her mother's life. However, it is important to recognize the emotional toll that such an experience can take on a young child. It is crucial that parents who choose to teach their children how to use firearms also educate them on the severity of the situation and the potential consequences of using deadly force. As the investigation into the incident continues, the bravery of Jayda Milsap serves as a reminder of the importance of being prepared for unexpected situations, particularly in cases of domestic violence. As a community, we must work together to support victims of abuse and take steps to prevent such tragedies from occurring in the future.
