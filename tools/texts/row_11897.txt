article: (CNN) -- Former Asian football president Mohammed bin Hammam has failed to overturn his life ban in an appeal to world ruling body FIFA. The Qatari had hoped to be reinstated after being accused of bribing officials for votes in June's FIFA presidential election, but the Appeal Committee announced on Thursday that the suspension will stand. "The appeal made by Mohammed bin Hammam has been rejected and the decision of the FIFA Ethics Committee confirmed," FIFA's website reported. "The sanction of being banned from taking part in any kind of football-related activity (administrative, sports or any other) at national and international level for life has therefore been maintained." Ecuador's Francisco Acosta chaired a panel also comprising Argentina's Fernando Mitjans and Augustin Senghor of Senegal to hear the case. Bin Hammam said he now intended to pursue the matter with the Court of Arbitration for Sport, where he feels he has a better chance of success. "Of course, today's outcome from the Appeal Committee was not unexpected or surprising. To be fair to the Appeal Committee members though, as a consequence of our experiences with the Ethics Committee, we didn't make serious efforts to prove my innocence this time around," he said on his website. "I can now see, at last, light at the end of the tunnel and I am heading confidently towards it. My next step is to go to CAS, where from now on I will be equal to my rival." Bin Hammam was provisionally found guilty of breaching FIFA's ethics code just days before the June 1 election, in which he was to be incumbent Sepp Blatter's only opponent. The 62-year-old withdrew from contention and was subsequently banned for life in July. He has maintained his innocence, despite being found guilty of offering money to Caribbean delegates. FIFA vice-president Jack Warner was also provisionally suspended for his part in the affair, but decided to resign rather than appear in front of the Ethics Committee. Bin Hammam, a former FIFA Executive Committee member, was chairman of the Qatar Football Association from 1992-96 and president of the Asian Football Confederation from 2002-11. He was a key figure as Qatar won the right to host the 2022 World Cup, despite accusations of corruption in the build-up to the FIFA delegates' vote on that tournament and the 2018 event, which went to Russia.

chatgpt: FIFA, the international governing body of football, has rejected the appeal of Mohammed Bin Hammam, a Qatari football official, against his life ban from the sport. Hammam had been accused of violating FIFA's code of ethics and attempting to buy votes from Caribbean delegates during his time as head of the Asian Football Confederation, a position he had held since 2002. The verdict was delivered by FIFA's Ethics Committee, which had originally banned Hammam in 2011. The Qatari official had appealed the ruling several times in the intervening years, but to no avail. The committee's ruling means that Hammam is effectively barred from involvement in football-related activities for the rest of his life. Hammam's case was one of several high-profile instances of corruption and misconduct that have plagued FIFA in recent years. The scandal involving Hammam came to light in the lead-up to the 2011 FIFA presidential election, when he was accused of attempting to bribe Caribbean football officials in exchange for their votes. The Ethics Committee found Hammam guilty of "conflict of interest" and "bribery" violations, and handed down the life ban after an investigation that lasted several months. The Qatari official vigorously denied the allegations against him, and his legal team argued that the FIFA investigation had been biased and unfair. Despite these claims, FIFA's Ethics Committee stood by its ruling, stating that there was "clear and convincing evidence" of Hammam's wrongdoing. The committee further stated that Hammam had failed to demonstrate "any remorse or repentance" for his actions, and that he presented a "grave danger" to the integrity of the game. The Hammam case was one of several that prompted widespread criticism of FIFA's handling of corruption and misconduct within football. The scandal ultimately led to the resignation of FIFA president Sepp Blatter in 2015, and a series of institutional reforms designed to increase transparency and accountability within the organization. In the wake of the Hammam ruling, some have praised FIFA for its commitment to upholding ethical standards in football. However, others have criticized the organization for not doing enough to prevent corruption and misconduct in the sport, and for only taking action against officials like Hammam after they have been caught. Despite these criticisms, the Hammam case represents a significant step forward in FIFA's ongoing efforts to promote transparency, accountability, and fair play in football. As the organization continues to implement reforms and strengthen its ethical framework, it is hoped that instances of corruption and misconduct will be reduced, and that football will emerge as a cleaner, fairer, and more enjoyable sport for all.
