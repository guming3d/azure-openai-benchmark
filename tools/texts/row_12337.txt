Hundreds of independent sports shops could be forced out of business after Nike and adidas announced they will no longer supply outlets that sell less than £25,000 of their products. The two firms, far and away the UK's market-leading sportswear brands, say it is no longer economically viable for them to supply smaller shops.

chatgpt: Adidas and Nike, two of the world's biggest sportswear brands, are facing criticism after announcing they will stop supplying products to smaller sports shops across the UK. Both firms cited cost-effectiveness as the reason behind the decision, claiming that supplying smaller stores was no longer profitable. This move could have severe consequences for these smaller businesses, who could be forced out of operation if they can no longer provide their customers with the popular brands. Adidas, which sponsored Team GB during the 2012 Olympics, has a lifetime deal with football legend David Beckham. Meanwhile, Nike is the current kit supplier for the England football team and sponsors many of the Premier League's top players. Former Olympics minister Tessa Jowell criticised the decision, calling on the two firms to reconsider. Jowell argued that the move would not only harm small businesses but also threaten the availability of sports gear in remote areas of the country. "Sportswear is not a luxury item, and it's not just about the latest trainers. It's about providing people with the tools they need to stay active and healthy," said Jowell. "It's important that brands like Adidas and Nike don't forget that." Many industry experts have also expressed concern about the move, warning that it could have a negative impact on the entire sportswear industry. Without smaller stores to sell their products, brands like Adidas and Nike will rely even more heavily on larger retailers like Sports Direct and JD Sports, who already hold a significant share of the market. However, both Adidas and Nike have defended their actions, stating that they will continue to supply larger retailers, including supermarkets and department stores. "We remain committed to providing our products to as many customers as possible, and we believe that by working with larger retailers, we can better meet the demands of our customers," said a spokesperson for Nike. Adidas echoed this sentiment, stating: "We understand that this decision may be disappointing to some smaller sports shops, but we believe it is the best course of action for our business at this time." Despite this, many consumers have expressed their disappointment with the two brands, calling on them to reconsider their decision to cease supplying smaller stores. "What about the people who rely on these smaller shops?" asked one Twitter user. "It's not fair to just think about profits and forget about the impact this will have on local communities." As the sportswear industry continues to grow, it remains to be seen whether this decision by Adidas and Nike will have a long-term impact on their business or whether they will reconsider their position in the future.
