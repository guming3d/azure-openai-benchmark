article: Opening statements in the trial of actress Nicollette Sheridan's claim that her "Desperate Housewives" character was killed off because she complained about mistreatment by the TV show's creator were delayed Wednesday morning as the judge considered an evidence dispute. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Elizabeth Allen White tossed reporters from the courtroom while she heard arguments over whether the jury should hear conversations that may have been protected by attorney-client privilege. Once lawyers deliver their openings to the jury, Sheridan is expected to testify in her wrongful termination lawsuit against series creator-producer-writer Marc Cherry and ABC. Several of Sheridan's former cast mates -- including Eva Longoria, Marcia Cross, James Denton, Felicity Huffman and Neal McDonough -- are on the list of witnesses expected to defend Cherry. The suit contends that Cherry created "a hostile work environment" from the show's beginning in 2004. "Cherry has a reputation for behaving in an extremely abusive and aggressive manner toward the individuals who work on the show, and is known for regularly demeaning the writers and staff in front of others on the show, including Sheridan," the suit says. Cherry focused his hostility on Sheridan in the fifth season when "Cherry consistently behaved in a dismissive, demeaning and unprofessional manner toward Sheridan, not only in front of the other cast and crew on the show, but before the public at large," it says. This "hostility and aggression toward Sheridan culminated" on the set of the show on September 24, 2008, the suit says. The suit alleges that "during a rehearsal for the show, when Sheridan questioned Cherry about something that was in the script, Cherry took her aside and forcefully hit her with his hand across her face and head." Sheridan complained to ABC executives about the September 2008 incident, but "nevertheless, Cherry's abusive and aggressive behavior towards Sheridan not only persisted, it worsened," the suit contends. "He continued to behave in a derisive and condescending manner toward Sheridan." Eleven episodes later, in March 2009, her character, Edie Britt, was electrocuted after a car crash, ending Sheridan's employment on the series. Defense lawyers argue that Cherry "lightly tapped her head in giving her direction for a scene," and "the decision that the character of Edie would die was made before the incident and was primarily a creative decision." Sheridan's lawyers contend it is "exceptionally unusual for a popular character to be killed off or written out of a television series unless the actor has requested to be released from his or her contract." Sheridan lost at least $20 million by missing out on the last three seasons, the suit says. Her pay was to be $250,000 for each episode in the eighth year, which is the final season for the series, it said. Lawyers estimated in court filings that testimony in the trial could last more than two weeks.

chatgpt: Actor Nicollette Sheridan has accused "Desperate Housewives" show creator and producer Marc Cherry of physically assaulting her during a rehearsal back in 2008. In a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, Sheridan claims Cherry hit her on the head during a discussion about a scene.  According to Sheridan's suit, Cherry apologized immediately after the alleged incident, but instead of addressing the issue, he killed off her character Edie Britt 11 episodes later. Sheridan believes that it was done in retaliation for her reporting what happened to show executives.  Cherry, on the other hand, has denied the allegations and claims that the supposed hit was nothing but a "light tap on the head" that was related to the scene they were rehearsing. He said that the decision to kill off Sheridan's character was a creative one and part of the storyline of the show.  Now, nearly 13 years later, several of the actors from "Desperate Housewives" are on the witness list for this case. Eva Longoria, Marcia Cross, James Denton, and Felicity Huffman have all been named as potential witnesses in Sheridan's case against Cherry.  While Longoria has yet to comment on the situation, Cross has said that she only witnessed one incident on the set of the show where Cherry got physical with someone, and that person was not Sheridan. Denton has reportedly said that he never saw Cherry be violent with anyone during his time on the show. Huffman, who has had her own legal issues, has yet to comment on whether she will take the stand in this case.  It's interesting to note that this case comes several years after "Desperate Housewives" concluded its eight-season run, leaving viewers to wonder what really happened on the set of the hit show. It's also a reminder of the importance of speaking up when something doesn't feel right in the workplace.  Sheridan's lawsuit is seeking $20 million in damages for assault and battery, wrongful termination, and discrimination based on her gender. This case is one to watch in the entertainment industry as it may set a precedent for how such incidents are handled on set, both legally and through the eyes of the public.  In conclusion, the allegations surrounding Marc Cherry's behavior towards Nicollette Sheridan are serious and can potentially ruin his reputation in the industry. Although there are contrasting statements from different people, including the actors from "Desperate Housewives," it will be up to the court to determine the credibility of these allegations. Until then, this case sheds light on what can happen behind the scenes of a big and successful production, emphasizing the importance of a safe and respectful work environment.
