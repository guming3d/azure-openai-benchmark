article: A tax could be put on fizzy drinks and biscuits could be emblazoned with health warnings in a new strategy to slash the nation’s sugar intake. A report commissioned by a Government agency says that targeting soft drinks would be an easy option in the war on sugar. It estimates that a 20 per cent tax on fizzy drinks – which would raise the price of a can from 70p to 84p – would cut the number of overweight Britons by more than a quarter of a million. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is under pressure to hike fizzy drinks' cost to tackle the growing obesity crisis . The leaked paper, which was written by heart doctors and health researchers, comes just weeks after the Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies warned that a ‘sugar tax’ may be necessary to tackle the country’s obesity epidemic. Figures show that British girls are the fattest in Europe, with almost a third overweight or obese. Around two thirds of adults are overweight or obese. The ‘options for action’ document, which was prepared for Public Health England, identifies six possible ways of reducing sugar intake: a tax on sugary drinks; foods being reformulated to contain less sugar; a cut in portion sizes; advertising rules being tightened; health warnings on  sugary products; and encouraging farmers to grow fruit and vegetables instead of sugar beet. The draft report describes sugary soft drinks as ‘low-hanging fruit’ – or an easy target – and says a 20 per cent sugar  tax would reduce obesity rates by 1.3  per cent. It argues that the move would have public support, ‘especially when health benefits are emphasised’. The paper, obtained by The Grocer magazine, is expected to form the basis of a report to be published on June 26. Public Health England said the Government had asked for its advice but any decision would lie with ministers. The Department of Health said it currently had no plans for a sugar tax. Coca-Cola Life (left), is a new naturally-sweetened drink with a third less sugar and calories than regular fizzy drinks  and will be launched in the new year. But health campaigners say people need to learn how to enjoy drinks that do not taste sweet - whether loaded with sugar or sweeteners - because at the moment we are 'drinking spoonfuls of sugar', as the shock image on the right represents . A . can of Coca Cola or Pepsi contains nine teaspoons of sugar - or 35g. This is almost half of the maximum recommended daily intake of sugar . Our diets could be improved by listening to the right kind of music, scientists claim. Researchers from Oxford University claim high-pitched tones trick the brain into thinking a food is sweeter than it really is, while low notes enhance bitter tastes. They said a dish could be made to taste up to 10 per cent sweeter through ‘sonic seasoning’, meaning less sugar was needed.

chatgpt: The UK's Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has been urged to introduce a new tax on fizzy drinks to curb sugar intake and tackle the obesity and diabetes crisis in the country. Campaigners have claimed that Brits are drinking sugar "by the spoonful" and sugary drinks are a major contributor to the worsening health problems. There have been calls for a 20% "fizzy drinks tax" to be introduced by the government, as it is hoped that this would persuade manufacturers and consumers to reduce their sugar consumption. This would in turn lead to a reduction in the number of people developing Type 2 diabetes, a condition linked to obesity and poor dietary habits that has become increasingly prevalent in the UK in recent years. However, the fizzy drinks industry has been quick to mount a defence, accusing campaigners of being "blinded by zeal" and arguing that taxes are not the answer to the problem. The industry claims that it has already implemented measures to reduce sugar levels in drinks and that education and awareness campaigns are more effective in changing habits. The proposed tax follows similar measures already taken in other countries, including Mexico and France, where levies on sugary drinks have led to a noticeable decrease in sales. The move is supported by a number of leading health organisations, including the British Medical Association and Cancer Research UK. The problem of sugar consumption in the UK has been well documented, with data suggesting that Brits consume more than double the recommended daily intake of sugar. This is largely due to the high levels of sugar in processed foods, but fizzy drinks have been identified as a particular area of concern, as they are the largest source of added sugar in the average person's diet. The proposed tax on fizzy drinks would aim to encourage manufacturers to reduce the sugar content of their products, while also making them less attractive to consumers. Some have argued that the tax should extend to other sugary drinks, including fruit juices and energy drinks, but this has not yet been formally proposed. While there is no doubt that a reduction in sugar intake would have significant health benefits, there are concerns about the potential impact on low-income families. Critics argue that a tax on fizzy drinks would disproportionately affect those on lower incomes, who are more likely to consume sugary drinks due to their lower cost. Overall, however, the proposed tax on fizzy drinks is seen as a positive step towards addressing the sugar consumption problem in the UK. While there may be debate about the best approach to reducing sugar intake, the need for action is clear, as the obesity and diabetes crisis continues to worsen. It remains to be seen whether the government will heed the calls for a tax on fizzy drinks, but the pressure to act is mounting from health campaigners and experts alike.
