article: (CNN) -- Scientists in New Zealand said there had been less than a one in twenty chance of Tuesday's earthquake being so destructive. The fatal 6.3 magnitude quake that has damaged much of Christchurch on New Zealand's South Island was actually an aftershock of the 7.1 magnitude earthquake that struck the same area in September last year. Seismologists for GNS Science had calculated on Monday that there was only a 35% chance of a 5.0 magnitude aftershock hitting the region in the near future, but only a 4% chance of a 6.0 or above aftershock.

Tuesday's quake caused widespread damage as the epicenter was only around 3 miles (5 kilometers) below the earth's surface. "Anything less than 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) deep is really shallow," said Fry. Fry and his colleagues had been monitoring the region since the September 4 earthquake. That quake struck before dawn and authorities said the deserted streets at that time likely kept injuries to a minimum. Most earthquakes happen away from the Christchurch region, said Fry, but in a country that experiences around 15,000 earthquakes each year, it wasn't completely unexpected, he said. The majority of those quakes are hardly felt and do not damage property. On average New Zealand only experiences a few magnitude 6 earthquakes each year. Prior to Tuesday's quake the most damaging to hit the country was in 1931 near Hawke's Bay on the North Island. The country is on the south western edge of the Ring of Fire, the ring of volcanoes and earthquakes that ring the Pacific ocean, and straddles the Pacific and Indian-Australian tectonic plates. Movement of the plates causes earthquakes across the country and volcanic activity in the North Island. Christchurch is New Zealand's second biggest city on the eastern side of the South Island. The population of around 390,000 and enjoys a mild climate and close proximity to beaches and mountains. Aftershocks are expected to continue to hit the Christchurch region in the coming days and weeks. The usual pattern is for a large aftershock followed by others of diminishing magnitude, said Fry. "The country is very seismically active. We probably won't see another (aftershock) this big, but there is still a statistical chance," Fry cautioned. Dean Irvine contributed to this report .

chatgpt: New Zealand has been known for its seismic activity with over 15,000 earthquakes occurring in the area each year. However, seismologists had predicted only a one in twenty chance that Tuesday's quake in Christchurch would be so destructive. The 6.3 magnitude quake that struck Christchurch was actually an aftershock of a larger earthquake in September that had a magnitude of 7.1. The earthquake on Tuesday caused severe damage to buildings and infrastructure in the city, bringing back memories of the earlier quake that had caused significant damage but no fatalities. New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern addressed the nation shortly after the quake, urging residents to stay calm and follow safety protocols. She assured the public that the government is closely monitoring the situation and is ready to provide support to those affected. Emergency response teams were quickly mobilized to tackle the aftermath of the earthquake. Many residents were left without power, water, and other basic amenities, prompting authorities to establish emergency shelters and relief centers. The New Zealand Defense Force was also deployed to assist in the relief and rescue operations. The quake disrupted air travel, with airports in the area suspending flights for several hours as a safety precaution. Train services and public transport were also temporarily halted. Businesses and schools were closed, with many residents returning to their homes to assess the damage and ensure the safety of their loved ones. Several international leaders have offered their condolences and support to New Zealand, including Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The United States and neighboring countries such as Australia and Indonesia have also offered assistance and resources for relief efforts. Experts say that the earthquake that struck Christchurch is a reminder of the region's vulnerability to seismic activity. New Zealand sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire, a belt of tectonic plates that are prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. As such, seismic activity is a constant threat, and the country's authorities have been actively investing in disaster preparedness measures. New Zealand has a long history of earthquakes, and despite the best efforts of seismologists and emergency responders, these events often result in significant loss of life and property damage. Tuesday's earthquake in Christchurch, while not catastrophic, serves as a reminder of the need for continued preparation, vigilance, and support for those affected by these natural disasters.
