article: Morality police in the Ukraine are trying to get Nickelodeon cartoon SpongeBob Squarepants banned because of its perceived 'promotion of homosexuality'. The Ukraine's National Expert Commission for Protecting Public Morality released the report, calling the children's cartoon a 'real threat to children'. Some of the other shows under fire include Family Guy, Pokemon, The Simpsons and Teletubbies, which the report says 'projects aimed at the destruction of the family, and the promotion of drugs and other vices'. Holding hands: SpongeBob Squarepants has been accused of promoting homosexuality, because SpongeBob holds hands with his friend Patrick . Creating 'imbeciles': The Ukraine's National Expert Commission for Protecting Public Morality says Teletubbies promotes drug use . The report says that Teletubbies sends children into a trance and creates 'an imbecile who will sit near the screen with an open mouth and swallow any information'. It also criticises the fact that one of the stars of the BBC children's show, Tinky Winky, carries what looks like a woman's handbag, saying: 'in real life, boys very rarely want to put on girls' clothes'. Cartoon star SpongeBob has a large gay fanbase in the U.S. as well as a being a huge hit with children. The 'evidence' that points to SpongeBob's homosexuality seems to extend to the fact that he regularly holds hands with a pink starfish called Patrick, who is also his best friend. Singled out: Family Guy and Pokemon were among other cartoons that the Ukraine morality watchdog wants to see banned from the country's TV screens . The Simpsons: Despite more than a decade of relatively trouble-free episodes, popular Fox TV show has also come under Ukrainian criticism . Equally suspect, apparently, is the fact that SpongeBob lives in an underwater pineapple and receives boating lessons from a teacher called Mrs Puff - 'puff' being both a derogatory and affectionate term to describe a gay man. Creator Stephen Hillenburg has defended his creation in the past, saying: 'I always think of him as being somewhat asexual. He added: 'Everybody is different, and the show embraces that. The character SpongeBob is an oddball. He's kind of weird, but he's kind of special.' The Wall Street Journal reported in the past that some of the cartoon's reported $500m merchandise sales have come from gay men purchasing branded toys, lunch boxes and even thongs.

chatgpt: The National Commission for Morality in Uganda has called for the banning of the popular children's show Teletubbies, claiming it promotes "drugs and other vices." The commission claims that the show "glorifies homosexuality" and features "cleavage-exposing" characters, which they say is inappropriate for children under the age of five. "Teletubbies is an LGBT show that promotes homosexuality and we do not want such content to be accessed by children," said Simon Lokodo, the Minister of Ethics and Integrity in Uganda. "The characters are also half-baked, with breasts and tight trousers. They are easily suggestive and therefore the show is not good for children." Mr. Lokodo has previously led efforts to ban music festivals and other events that he deems as promoting immoral behavior. The National Commission for Morality has also called for the arrest of anyone involved in the production, distribution or exhibition of the show in Uganda. The commission's assertion that Teletubbies promotes drug use and other vices has been met with surprise from child development experts. "The show was designed specifically for preschool children, and its themes are deliberately simple and non-threatening," said Dr. Lucy Power, a child development specialist. "It promotes basic social skills and language development, as well as physical coordination and movement." The show's creators have not yet commented on the allegations made by the commission. Teletubbies first aired in the United Kingdom in 1997 and has since been translated into over 45 languages and broadcast in more than 120 countries. The show features four brightly colored characters who live in a magical, pastoral land called Teletubbyland. Each episode features the characters engaging in simple activities, such as dancing or playing with their toys. Teletubbies has been praised for its positive impact on early childhood education and has won numerous awards for its educational content. However, the show has also been criticized for its simplistic plotlines and lack of variety in character development. The Ugandan government has a history of censoring media content that it deems inappropriate, including banning pornography and blocking social media platforms during major political events. The ban on Teletubbies is just the latest move by the government to control the country's media landscape and promote what it calls 'moral values.'
