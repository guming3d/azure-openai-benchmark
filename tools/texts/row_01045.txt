But expert Dr Leonard Press said this can only happen if the eye is permanently covered BEFORE the age of seven . It's a hairstyle favoured by celebs from Rihanna to Justin Bieber and often copied by their young fans. But a leading optometrist has warned that having a side fringe that falls into the face can cause long-term eye damage. Andrew Hogan told the Australian Daily Telegraph: 'If a young emo chap has a fringe covering one eye all the time, that eye won't see a lot of detail. And if it happens from a young age, that eye can become amblyotic.' Hair raising: Rihanna, left, and Cameron Diaz often wear a side fringe - but could it damage their sight? Not according to experts . Amblyopia is more commonly known as a lazy eye and is a childhood condition which means the sufferer can't see as clearly out of one eye, so they rely on the other. It can occur as a child's sight develops so if a child has one of their eyes blocked, eg by an eye patch, when they are in a key developmental stage then they could develop a lazy eye. Mr Hogan believes having a side fringe means the hair can become like an eye patch across the eye and so cause the condition, and also short-sightedness, by restricting sunlight and stimulation from reaching the eye. 'If you walk around with an eye patch on all day, then that eye will end up seeing more poorly than the other eye,' he explained. Emo trend: Members of the band 30 Seconds To Mars favour the fringe across the face look . He added that he was aware that visual development took place between birth to seven years, but that research had shown him vision could still be affected at later stages. But experts have poured cold water on Mr Hogan's theory. Amblyopia specialist Dr Leonard Press told MSNBC: 'The story would only be true if you had somebody young enough, and if that person never looked out of that eye - if it was blocked 24-7. The reason it's false is that you donâ€™t have that constant deprivation.' Dr Press added that vision is 'so well-established' after the age of seven that 'combing your hair over your eye will not do anything to that system'. So teenagers and young people can rest assured that they won't be risking their long-term eye sight by wearing the trendy style. However, a leading Australian hairdresser told the Australian Telegraph they do run another risk - a sore neck! Roseanne Anderson said: 'I have to wonder how they don't get a stiff neck. I . have seen lots of fashions come and go - but really when I think about . it, this is probably the only hairstyle in my 40 years of hairdressing . that could be a health hazard.'

chatgpt: A recent debate has emerged in the optometry community regarding the impact of having a fringe across the face on a person's eyesight. Leading optometrist Andrew Hogan has claimed that a fringe can obstruct light and stimulation to the eye, leading to a condition known as amblyopia. However, expert Dr. Leonard Press has stated that this can only occur if the eye is permanently covered before the age of seven. Amblyopia, also known as lazy eye, is a condition in which one eye fails to develop properly in early childhood. It often occurs as a result of visual deprivation, meaning that the eye is not receiving enough visual stimulation during a critical period of growth and development. The affected eye can become weaker, resulting in reduced visual acuity and depth perception. Hogan's claim that a fringe can contribute to amblyopia is based on the idea that the fringe may block light and visual stimulation to the eye, leading to visual deprivation. He suggests that people who wear fringes across their faces regularly may be at risk of developing the condition over time. However, Press has argued that this is only true if the eye is permanently covered before the age of seven. This is because the critical period for visual development ends around this age, meaning that any visual deprivation after this time is unlikely to cause significant harm. Press suggests that an occasional obstruction of light or visual stimulation caused by a fringe would not be enough to cause amblyopia in an adult. While there is some disagreement among experts on this issue, it is clear that visual deprivation during the critical period of early childhood can lead to amblyopia. Children who have significant obstructions to their vision, such as cataracts or a drooping eyelid, are at particular risk for developing the condition. In such cases, early intervention is crucial in order to prevent permanent vision loss. Hogan has suggested that people who are concerned about their eye health should avoid wearing fringes across their faces regularly. While there is little scientific evidence to support this claim, it is certainly true that visual stimulation is essential for healthy eye development. Adults who are concerned about their eye health may wish to consult an optometrist or ophthalmologist for advice on how to maintain good visual health. In conclusion, the debate over whether a fringe across the face can lead to amblyopia is ongoing in the optometry community. While some experts believe that this is a real risk, others suggest that it is unlikely to cause harm in adults. Whatever the case may be, it is clear that visual stimulation during the critical period of early childhood is essential for healthy eye development. Parents and caregivers should be aware of the importance of providing their children with adequate visual stimulation in order to prevent the development of conditions such as amblyopia.
