article: Australian men now have the third highest life expectancy in the world, according to a new report published by the World Health Organisation. That doesn't necessarily give blokes bragging rights over Australian women - with women still outliving their male counterparts by an average four-point-one years. But one leading Australian researcher has warned that planned cuts to health funding could spell an end to Australia's life expectancy rates. Third highest life expectancy: Australian men born in 2012 are expected to live until the age of 80.5 years, placing them just below Iceland and Switzerland on the rankings . The figures, which show increased life expectancy across the world, are for children born in 2012. Iceland tops the table at 81.2 years for men, while Japanese women are expected to live the longest at 87 years. For people in richer countries, fewer people dying from heart disease and stroke before their 60th birthday can be credited for longer life expectancy rates. In poorer countries, the increase can be credited to fewer children dying before their fifth birthday.

The main reason for Australia's high placing is it's quality of life, according to Professor Sharon Friel, director of the Menzies Centre for Health Policy at the Australian National University. 'Australia has very good social conditions, relative to other countries - which are very important to people's health and wellbeing,' Professor Friel told Mail Online. Additionally, Professor Friel credits Australia's good quality drinking water, very good sanitation, abundance of fresh food availability and the way our built environments are designed for the high quality of life. But paramount to Australia's quality of life is it's universal healthcare system. 'Access to healthcare is commonplace across Australia - so we have been the envy of the world partly for that reason,' she said. Doing well, but possibly not for much longer: Professor Sharon Friel has warned that despite their current high placing, Australia could drop if planned preventative health funding cuts were to go ahead . Professor Friel believes the government should be celebrating the social policies that have supported people in a way that's good for their health and leading to longer life expectancy rates. However, she's warned that if the Federal Government goes ahead with planned cuts to health funding, these figures might not hold up in a few years time. 'Internationally the evidence tells us the focus on primary healthcare and preventative health is the most effective and financially efficient way to do this,' she said.

chatgpt: The latest statistics on life expectancy have identified Australian men as living up to 80.5 years old, ranking the country third in the world. Australian women, on the other hand, ranked lower at sixth place, tied with South Korea, living to an average of 84.6 years old. However, a leading population health expert warns that these rankings may not be the case for much longer. According to the report released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the life expectancy of Australian males has increased by 0.2 years since 2015-2017, and the life expectancy of females has increased by 0.1 years. Despite the slight increase, Australian women's life expectancy dropped from fifth place in 2015-2017 to sixth place in 2018-2020. It is worth noting that Japan leads the world in terms of life expectancy, with women living up to an average of 88 years and men up to 81 years. Switzerland ranked second for men, and Singapore came in second place for women. Dr. Jane Tong, a population health expert, stated that these rankings may not stay the same for much longer. "We've seen this trend of decreasing life expectancy due to increased rates of lifestyle diseases such as obesity and diabetes," Tong warned. "If we don't address these issues, we may see a decline in rankings in the coming years." Tong further explained that these rankings are usually indicative of a country's overall health status. "Countries with higher life expectancies tend to have better healthcare systems and standards of living," Tong said. "It's essential to focus on improving the overall health and well-being of our population, so we can maintain our rankings in the future." The report also highlighted the disparities in life expectancy across different socio-economic groups in Australia. Men from the most deprived areas have a 2.9-year shorter life expectancy than men from the least deprived areas. For women, the gap is 2.1 years. Tong underscored the importance of addressing health inequalities in the country. "We need to ensure that all groups have access to quality healthcare, education, and healthy environments," Tong said. "By doing so, we can close the gap and improve health outcomes for all Australians." In conclusion, while Australia has ranked third in the world for male life expectancy and sixth for women, this may not be the case for much longer. As the country faces increasing rates of lifestyle diseases, it's important to address the root causes of these issues and improve the overall health and well-being of the population to maintain its position in the rankings. Moreover, the disparities in life expectancy across different socio-economic groups in Australia highlight the need to address health inequalities and ensure equal access to healthcare for all.
