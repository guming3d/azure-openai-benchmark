A neighbour said he watched the thieves thinking they were builders . Owner Leigh O'Shea of Westcliff, Essex, said: 'At first I thought someone had reversed into the wall and it had collapsed but then I saw the bricks had gone, apart from some broken ones and a lot of rubble. 'I just couldn't believe it. It seems ridiculous that something can be there for more than 100 years and they just come and take it.' The 56-year-old, who is a lecturer and nurse at the University of Essex, is renovating the property, which has been derelict for 15 years. Ms O'Shea, a mother of five, discovered what had happened when she brought a friend along to have a look at the property. She said: 'A man nearby said he saw two people that did it loading onto a yellow flatbed lorry between 11am and 11.30am. 'They started at about 10am. He just assumed I had hired them to take it down. He even handed them a broom because he didn't think they had cleared up very well.' Before: The 60ft-long brick wall, which dates back to the 1890s, is believed to be worth £4,000 . She had been on the garden and interior of the former antique shop since Boxing Day, aiming to move in with her three children this year. 'Doing up this house was one of those dreams you have,' she said. 'The opportunity to buy it came up and I thought it was now or never. 'I was so angry that people should do this, how dare they come and take it? 'I work really hard and what I have I have got myself. I can't afford to pay builders, I am planning to do as much work as I can myself and with my children.' Essex Police are investigating the incident, which happened on June 5.
