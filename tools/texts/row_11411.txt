article: Billionaire: John McAfee arrested in Belize . The millionaire British founder of security firm McAfee has been forcefully arrested in Belize following a drugs and weapons bust at his property. John McAfee had his house in Orange Walk, Belize City, surrounded by armed guards on Monday. McAfee says they stormed his house, killed his dog and handcuffed him in the sun for 14 hours without food or water. The 67-year-old, who founded the popular McAfee antivirus computer software, moved from America to Belize in 2008 after a series of lawsuits that threatened to wipe out his fortune. The eccentric entrepreneur now runs an antibiotic drug company from the tiny central American country. He said he was arrested because he refused to donate money to a local politician. McAfee told Belize's News 5: . 'On Monday at six o’clock, I was awakened by the sound of a bullhorn, a . megaphone. I went outside and saw about thirty GSU in full uniform, . fully dressed, automatic weapons, storming through the property and . driveway. 'I went back inside, got some clothes on, I came out. I was told to put up my hands up against the wall as were eleven other people in the compound. 'It began, innocently enough, with my refusal to donate to the local political boss of the district where I lived in Orange Walk and I have given at least two million dollars in gifts to the police departments in Orange Walk, San Pedro, Belize City.' Belize: McAfee founder moved to the tropical central American country in 2008 . Belize's Gang Services Unit (GSU) said . they found a cache of weapons on McAfee's property and that he did not . have a licence to manufacture drugs. The GSU issued a statement which said: 'Present on the premises at the time were John McAfee, his girlfriend who is a 17-year-old Belizean minor and five security guards. 'During the search ten firearms - seven 12-gauge pump action shotguns, one 12-gauge single action shotgun, one Taurus nine-millimetre pistol and one nine-millimetre CZ pistol were found.' Five air rifles and 270 12-gauge cartridges were also found. McAfee was born in England and moved to America at an early age. He founded his software company in 1989 from his home in Santa Clara, California. It has since become one of the largest software companies in the world and was bought by electronics maker Intel for £5billion in 2010, although the founder no longer had any share in it. He lost much of his money in the financial crash, and his wealth reportedly declined from $100million (£62million) to less than $4million. McAfee was not given any charge and says he is seeking legal advice.

chatgpt: Tech entrepreneur John McAfee, best known for creating McAfee antivirus software, claims that his recent arrest in the Central American country of Belize was related to his refusal to donate to a local political party. McAfee was arrested last week on charges of firearm offenses after Belizean police raided his home on Ambergris Caye. During the raid, McAfee's pet dog was shot and left handcuffed in the sun for 14 hours. According to Belizean authorities, McAfee was arrested for possession of illegal weapons and drugs, as well as for allegedly having a relationship with a 17-year-old minor. McAfee has denied all of these allegations, claiming that they are politically motivated. McAfee had moved to Belize in 2008 after a series of lawsuits were filed against him in the United States. On his blog, he stated that he chose Belize because it was "a place where I could live free," and where he could "develop new technologies." The arrest of McAfee has once again brought Belize's security situation into the spotlight. The country, which has a population of just over 400,000, has one of the highest murder rates in the world, with much of the violence linked to drug trafficking and gangs. According to the US State Department, Belize is also a major transit point for drugs heading to the United States. The fact that McAfee was able to live in Belize for several years without running afoul of the law has also raised questions about law enforcement in the country. While McAfee was known for his eccentric behavior, he was also a big investor in the local economy and was developing a new antibiotic in partnership with Belizean scientists. McAfee, who is currently being held in prison in Belize, has vowed to fight the charges against him. In a post on his blog, he wrote, "I am an innocent man and I will fight with every ounce of my being to clear my name." The incident has also raised questions about the safety of foreigners in Belize, particularly those who choose to live off the grid. In recent years, a number of expatriates have moved to the country to live a simpler life, but some have reported being targeted by criminals. Despite the recent negative headlines, there are still those who see Belize as a desirable place to live. The country boasts pristine beaches, a vibrant culture, and a relatively low cost of living. However, as the case of John McAfee shows, living in Belize can also be fraught with danger.
