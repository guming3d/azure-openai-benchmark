article: (CNN) -- For the third time in a year, Japan's government has intervened in the yen, its unit of currency, according to Japan's finance minister. "While Japan is dealing with the reconstruction of the tsunami zone, if the surging of the yen continues, it could negatively affect Japan's economy and financial stability," Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda told reporters. "Therefore, Japan has intervened in the currency market. We will continue to watch the movement of the currency market closely." Minutes after the announcement, the Nikkei stock index shot up 100 points and the yen weakened against the dollar. The Bank of Japan responded to the move in a press release, saying that it "strongly expects that the action taken by the Ministry of Finance in the foreign exchange market will contribute to stable price formation in the market." Japan's economy, still struggling after the March 11 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis, has been hit hard by the falling U.S. dollar. Uncertainty by global markets over the U.S. debt deal caused the dollar to plummet versus the Japanese yen, a currency seen as a safe haven by investors. Japanese automakers and electronics companies have seen the currency shift eat into their corporate profits as the dollar has sunk. Japan's exporters operate on the global market with the U.S. dollar, but then repatriate the funds to Japan in yen. JP Morgan Japan estimates corporate profits have fallen approximately 5% in the last six weeks as the U.S. dollar has plummeted. Perhaps the hardest-hit company is the world's largest automaker, Toyota. The car maker estimates it loses approximately $385 million for every 1 yen movement up versus the dollar. By that estimate, in July, Toyota lost more than a billion dollars based on the currency shift alone. Toyota Motor Corporation this week, in announcing their first-quarter earnings for the 2012 fiscal year, called the exchange rate too much to bear. Senior managing officer Takahiko Ijichi said, "I understand that it's our fate to adapt to ever-changing exchanging rates. But this situation, where the yen has passed 80 yen and is now at 76 yen, for us exporters, it's extremely tough." CNN's Kyung Lah contributed to this report.

chatgpt: In an effort to protect the stability of the tsunami region, Japan's Finance Ministry has announced that they will be closely monitoring the movement of the currency market. The strength of the yen has been a concern for the government, as it affects the ability of Japanese businesses in the affected areas to stay competitive. This has been especially difficult for the country's automakers and electronics firms, who have seen their profits plummet due to the falling dollar. The Finance Ministry has made it clear that they will be taking proactive steps to mitigate these negative effects. A spokesperson for the ministry stated, "We will continue to watch the movement of the currency market closely, and take any measures necessary to ensure the stability of the region." The announcement was met with immediate positive response in the stock market. The Nikkei stock index rose moments after the announcement was made public. This shows that investors have confidence in the government's response to the issue, and believe that their actions will help to stabilize the economy. The impact of the strong yen has been felt across the country, but it has been especially difficult for those in the tsunami region. The area was already struggling to recover from the disaster, and the weakened state of the economy has only made things worse. The government's commitment to keeping a close eye on the currency market is a welcome sign for many residents of the region, who are hoping to see an improvement in the economy. While the falling dollar has affected many Japanese businesses negatively, it has been especially difficult for the country's automakers and electronics firms. These industries have been hit hard by the strong yen, as it makes their products more expensive for foreign buyers. This has led to a decline in profits, and in some cases, layoffs for employees. The Finance Ministry's announcement is a signal that the government is taking the issue seriously, and is willing to take action to help those affected by the currency market fluctuations. It remains to be seen what specific measures they will take, but the public seems to have confidence in their ability to stabilize the situation. Overall, the government's commitment to closely monitoring the currency market shows that they are aware of the negative effects of the strong yen, and are willing to take action to prevent further damage. The Nikkei's positive response to the announcement is a sign that investors are confident in the government's ability to stabilize the economy, and many residents of the tsunami region are hopeful that this will lead to a brighter future for their communities.
