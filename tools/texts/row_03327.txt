article: BRUSSELS, Belgium (CNN) -- European leaders agreed Friday to send an 1,800-strong security force to maintain stability in Kosovo, although they stopped short of backing independence for the province. French soldiers at the NATO-led peacekeeping mission in Kosovo last month. Kosovo is expected to declare independence from Serbia early in the new year. Serbia, however, insists the region should remain autonomous within its borders. Speaking at the end of a one-day summit of European heads in Brussels, Jose Socrates, the Portuguese prime minister currently holding the European Union presidency, said that sending the security mission was a "political decision." The police and security force is expected to be deployed to the Balkan state ahead of an announcement of independence. "This is the clearest signal that the EU could possibly give that it intends to lead on the whole issue of Kosovo's future, its status and its role in the region," Socrates said. According to CNN's Robin Oakley in Brussels, European leaders are trying to balance an obvious readiness to back Kosovan independence with incentives to Serbia, which is seeking membership of the EU. EU leaders are deeply conscious of their failure in the early 1990s to move early enough to prevent the bloodletting in the Balkans over the break-up of the former Yugoslavia, he said. Although most EU leaders support Serbia becoming a member state to boost stability in the Balkans, French President Nicholas Sarkozy said that Serbia's membership is dependent on it recognizing Kosovo's independence and handing over war criminals. Socrates confirmed to CNN that any fast-tracking of Serbia into the EU could only be considered if it agreed to hand over Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb general wanted at the The Hague for suspected war crimes. Two years of negotiations on the future status of Kosovo ended in failure earlier this week, when talks mediated by Europe, the United States and Russia ended without an agreement. The disputed province is dear to the Serbs, Orthodox Christians who regard it as Serbian  territory. But it is equally coveted by Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, Muslims who have a 90 percent majority. Since 1999 the United Nations has been running the province with NATO peacekeepers, who still number 16,000. Oakley said the EU mission to Kosovo would help to ease the handover from the U.N. to local authorities. E-mail to a friend .

chatgpt: On Monday, European leaders agreed to send a 1,800-strong security force to Kosovo as the region prepares to declare independence from Serbia in the new year. The group will include police officers, judges, and customs officials from EU countries in an effort to stabilize the area and maintain peace during the transition. The decision to deploy this security force was a critical one, given the current political climate in the Balkans. Kosovo has been under United Nations administration since 1999, following a NATO bombing campaign against Serbia. Since then, the region has successfully developed an autonomous government, but its official status remains unclear. Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority has been working towards independence, a move that has been supported by many countries including the United States and most EU nations. However, Serbia maintains that Kosovo should remain part of its territory, leaving the region with an uncertain future. The security force, which will be known as the European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX), will work alongside the existing UN and NATO missions in the region. The group was created with the support of Serbia, which hopes the EU can help maintain the existing autonomy of Kosovo within Serbia's borders. "This mission is an important step forward in ensuring the rule of law in Kosovo and consolidating its stability," said Lithuanian Foreign Minister Vygaudas UÅ¡ackas, whose country currently holds the EU's rotating presidency. EULEX will provide training and support to Kosovo's police, judges, and customs officials and investigate any crimes that may occur. While the mission will be led by the EU, it is expected to have close cooperation with the UN and NATO. Despite the international presence in Kosovo, tensions in the region remain high. Some factions within Kosovo believe that EULEX will not do enough to protect their interests, while others fear that the mission will be seen as a threat by Serbia. Despite the challenges, the EU remains committed to ensuring the security and stability of the region. "The mission will have a crucial role to play in strengthening the rule of law and promoting human rights in Kosovo," said Javier Solana, the EU's foreign policy chief. The deployment of EULEX has been widely welcomed by officials in Kosovo and Serbia, who believe it will help maintain peace during a critical time in the region's history. With independence looming and tensions running high, the success of this mission will play a critical role in determining Kosovo's future.
