article: Tinder is planning to unveil a new ‘undo’ button that will give users a second chance to review potential matches that they have already swiped left and rejected. There is currently no way to contact a user on the dating app once you have chosen to dismiss their profile and swiped left to erase them from your profile forever – even if the rejection was accidental. But now users of the popular app will have the chance to reclaim lost loves thanks to the new feature, which is being released as part of a new premium upgrade called Tinder Plus. Giving love a second chance: Tinder is planning to unveil a new 'undo' button that will let users reconsider matches they may have accidentally rejected . The undo button is something users have been asking for since Tinder’s launch, according to Forbes. Indeed, a quick Google search brings up multiple Reddit conversations on the necessity of such a function. Another new perk of the premium plan is a travel feature that will let users 'jump across the country and globe, swiping through potential matches in Barcelona and Boston, Rio and Rome.' Tinder Places, a third premium feature that could roll out at a later time, would help users meet new people based on venues they frequent, such as bars, stadiums, museums and parks. The announcement was made by Tinder CEO Sean Rad, who just announced that he's stepping down from his post. The 28-year-old will remain on Tinder's board and serve as president when the new CEO is chosen by the app's majority owner, IAC. Changes: Sean Rad, who just revealed that he's stepping down from his post as Tinder's CEO, announced the plan for a premium service at the Forbes Under 30 Summit in Philadelphia . When explaining the company's decision to launch the premium plan, Mr Rad said: 'We are adding features users have been begging us for. They will offer so much value we think users are willing to pay for them.' He added: 'We had to get our product and growth right first. Revenue has always been on the road map.' The app, which has become popular around the globe, sees 1.2 billion profiles swiped and almost 14 million matches made every day. The upgrade will mean users can still use the free version, but a fee will give them access to additional features.
highlights: The new feature is part of Tinder Plus, a new premium service for paying customers that will roll out soon .

chatgpt: Tinder, the popular dating app, is set to launch a new premium service called Tinder Plus that will introduce a slew of new features to the platform. One of these new features is the ability to "undo" a rejected swipe, which will allow users to resurrect a potential match that they may have accidentally swiped left on. While the "undo" feature has been available on other dating apps, such as Bumble and Hinge, Tinder's version is unique in that it allows users to go back as many times as they want. To activate the feature, users will need to upgrade to Tinder Plus, which will cost $9.99 per month in the US, and £9.99 in the UK. Tinder Plus will also introduce several other features, including the ability to swipe in locations outside of a user's current location. This means that users will be able to swipe and match with people in other cities, even if they're not physically there. Additionally, users will be able to "like" an unlimited number of profiles, rather than the current limit of 100 per day. Tinder Plus will also offer a feature called "Passport," which will allow users to swipe and match with people in any location around the world. This feature is aimed at frequent travelers, and could provide an interesting way to meet new people while on the go. While the new features may be appealing to some users, others are concerned that Tinder Plus is an attempt by the company to monetize the app and further segregate users based on their ability to pay. Some users have even taken to Twitter and other social media platforms to voice their frustration, with some calling for a boycott of the app. However, Tinder CEO Sean Rad dismissed these concerns in a recent interview with TechCrunch, stating that the new features were designed to enhance the user experience and provide more value to paying customers. He also noted that the majority of Tinder's revenue still comes from advertising, and that the company is not looking to create a "class system" for users. Regardless of the controversy, Tinder Plus is set to roll out soon, and will undoubtedly change the way that users interact with the app. Whether it will be a success or not remains to be seen, but one thing is for sure: the dating landscape is constantly evolving, and Tinder is leading the charge.
