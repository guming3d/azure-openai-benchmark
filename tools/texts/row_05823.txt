article: Washington (CNN) -- Transgender groups are applauding a court ruling in favor of a Georgia woman who sued after claiming she was fired from her state position because of a sex change. A federal appeals court in Atlanta concluded transgender workers are protected under the Constitution. Vandiver Elizabeth Glenn was a legislative editor in the Georgia General Assembly . "The question here is whether discriminating against someone on the basis of his or her gender non-conformity constitutes sex-based discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause," said the three-judge panel. "We hold that it does." The 19-page ruling came last week, not long after the court heard oral arguments in Atlanta, a very fast turnaround in such an appeal. Glenn -- who was once known as Glenn Morrision -- alleged she was told she was let go because her 2005 decision to transition from male to female would be viewed as "immoral" by state lawmakers. Her boss also objected to Glenn showing up at an office Halloween party dressed as a woman, and asked Glenn to leave. A federal judge later concluded Glenn's supervisor believed the gender reassignment was inappropriate, disruptive and would make her co-workers uncomfortable. The judge, when ruling for Glenn, had said she could return to work, but delayed that until the appeals court ruled. Monday's decision means she could be back on the job within days. State attorneys had argued no discrimination laws were broken since protections extended to certain classes of individuals did not include transgender employees. The appeals panel said the reasons cited by the state in its defense were not acceptable. "An individual cannot be punished because of his or her perceived gender non-conformity," said the ruling. "Because these protections are afforded to everyone, they cannot be denied to a transgender individual." The court added, "For example, courts have held that plaintiffs cannot be discriminated against for wearing jewelry that was considered too effeminate, carrying a serving tray too gracefully, or taking too active a role in child-rearing." Among the judges who supported the woman, who now goes by Vandy Beth Glenn, was William Pryor, one of the most conservative federal appeals judges. He was named to the court by President George W. Bush in 2005. The state has the option of appealing to the Supreme Court for review. The case is Glenn v. Brumby (10-14833).

chatgpt: In a groundbreaking decision on Thursday, a three-judge panel of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that transgender workers are protected under the Constitution. The ruling came as a response to a lawsuit filed by Vandy Beth Glenn, who claimed she had been discriminated against by her employer, the Georgia General Assembly. Glenn had worked at the Georgia legislature as a legislative editor for over two years when she came out as a transgender woman in 2005. She claimed that her supervisor told her that her change would be viewed as "immoral." When she refused to resign, she was fired. The court's ruling stated that "gender non-conformity is a form of sex discrimination," and that "protections are afforded to everyone, regardless of gender identity." The decision was hailed as a victory for LGBT rights and a significant step towards further inclusion and acceptance in the workplace. "This ruling is a game-changer," said Peter Renn, attorney at Lambda Legal, which represented Glenn in her lawsuit. "It gives transgender people legal protection against discrimination in the workplace, and it affirms the constitutional argument we have been making for years." The court's decision also has significant implications for other areas of discrimination law. The judges explicitly stated that their ruling extends to other forms of sex discrimination, such as sexual orientation and stereotyping. This could lead to the expansion of legal protections for gay and lesbian employees as well. "The court's decision is not just good news for transgender workers, it's a huge step forward for the rights of all LGBTQ+ people," said Sarah Warbelow, legal director at the Human Rights Campaign. "It sends a clear message that discrimination is not acceptable in any form, and that everyone should be protected under the law." Glenn herself expressed relief and gratitude in a statement after the ruling was announced. "I am incredibly grateful for this decision," she said. "I hope that it will help other transgender people to feel safer and more supported in their workplaces. No one should have to face discrimination simply for being who they are." The court's decision is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court, but for now, it stands as a clear and significant victory for the rights of transgender workers, and a powerful affirmation of the principle of equality under the Constitution.
