article: (CNN) -- When the MotoGP season began, not many would have picked Marc Marquez to win the individual title. He was a rookie making the transition from Moto2 and replacing one of the sport's greats, Casey Stoner, at Honda. He also had to contend with reigning world champion Jorge Lorenzo and perennial contender Dani Pedrosa. According to British oddsmaker William Hill, Marquez was merely the joint third favorite at 7/2, behind Lorenzo and Pedrosa and tied with motorcycling legend Valentino Rossi. But Marquez's brash style -- along with shoulder injuries to Lorenzo and Pedrosa -- saw the Spaniard move into contention and it appears nothing can stop the 20-year-old from becoming the first rookie to claim the MotoGP crown in 35 years. His odds of winning the title now stand at a miniscule 1/9. "There are no excuses," Lorenzo said. "Marc was faster than us and he was better. I can only congratulate him and look forward to the next race." Lorenzo was speaking to reporters Sunday, after Marquez captured Spain's Aragon Grand Prix -- but they were words he could have uttered for much of the campaign. Marquez chased down Yamaha's Lorenzo -- it wasn't the first time this season that happened -- before easing to the finish line. It ended Lorenzo's two-race winning streak and boosted Marquez's overall advantage to a substantial 39 points with only four races remaining. "I didn't expect this before the start of the season," Marquez was quoted as saying by Australian news agency AAP this month. "My goal was just to take some podiums and try to fight for some victories in the end of the season. "At the moment I want to go race by race but for sure we have some possibility (to win the crown). "We don't have any pressure because we have already done better than what we expected." Pedrosa probably wasn't all that impressed with Marquez, his teammate, on Sunday. They touched on lap 6 as Marquez seemed to out-brake himself and Pedrosa crashed seconds later, hurting his hip and groin. "Marc went in too wide on the corner entry, clipped me from the outside and I went flying when I got on the gas," Pedrosa told the team website. "My mechanics told me later that the traction-control cable had been cut by the contact." Marquez apologized. "The team told me I caused his traction-control cable to snap and I'm sorry for that," Marquez told the team website. "It's something very unusual to see." But seeing Marquez atop the standings has become commonplace.

chatgpt: The 2018 MotoGP season is rapidly drawing to a close with four races left on the calendar. Defending world champion Marc Marquez is currently leading the championship standings by 39 points over his nearest rival, Andrea Dovizioso. Marquez extended his lead in the standings by winning the Aragon Grand Prix on Sunday. The race at Aragon was a thrilling affair, with Marquez catching up to his former teammate Jorge Lorenzo and overtaking him in the final stages of the race. However, the win was not without controversy as Marquez made contact with his own Repsol Honda teammate Dani Pedrosa in the early stages of the race. Pedrosa crashed later on, ending his hopes of finishing the race and sparking criticism of Marquez's aggressive riding style. Despite the fallout from the incident, Marquez remained at the front of the pack and secured his sixth win of the season. This was a crucial result for the defending champion as his main rivals, including Dovizioso and Valentino Rossi, all failed to finish on the podium. The win also marked the 67th Grand Prix victory for Honda, which was a reason for celebration for the team. The next three races in Malaysia, Australia, and Japan are crucial for Marquez as he seeks to secure his fifth MotoGP world championship. The previous two races have not gone in Marquez's favour, with a fourth-place finish in San Marino and a race-ending incident at the previous round in Misano. However, Marquez has not lost his fighting spirit, saying that he is happy to take on the pressure and keep pushing for the title. The Malaysian Grand Prix will take place in Sepang on October 28, followed by the Australian Grand Prix at Phillip Island on November 4, and the Japanese Grand Prix at Motegi on November 18. Marquez has a strong track record at all these races, with a total of nine victories across the three circuits. However, he will need to maintain his focus and avoid any more incidents if he is to close out the title and secure his place in MotoGP history. The final race of the 2018 MotoGP season will take place in Valencia on November 18, where the world champion will be crowned. With just four races remaining, the pressure is on for all the riders, but none more so than Marquez. As he attempts to solidify his place among the greats of the sport, fans will be eagerly watching to see if he can continue his dominant form and secure another world championship.
