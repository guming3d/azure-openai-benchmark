article: New Delhi (CNN) -- India's supreme court has temporarily barred the Italian ambassador from leaving the country as a diplomatic row over Rome's refusal to return two of its marines accused of killing two Indian fishermen intensified. Last month, the court allowed the two Italian sailors -- Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone -- to participate in their country's elections after Ambassador Daniele Mancini's assurance about their return in four weeks. Latorre and Girone are facing trial in India in connection with the 2012 killing of the fishermen off the country's coast. The defendants say they mistook the fishermen for pirates. On Thursday, the top Indian court demanded an explanation from Mancini by March 18 over his country's decision not to send them back. "Till then (March 18), Mr. Daniele Mancini shall not leave India without the permission of this court," the order said. Italy insists the February 2012 shooting involving its marines happened in international waters and was therefore outside of Indian jurisdiction. In a statement Monday, the Italian Foreign Ministry said the sailors would not go back to India. "Italy takes this opportunity to inform the Indian government that, given the formal acknowledgment of an international dispute between the two states, Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone will not be returning to India upon expiration of the leave granted (to) them," it said. The Italian move has invited strong reaction in New Delhi, with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh warning Rome of consequences. "Our government has already made it clear that these actions of the government of Italy are not acceptable. They violate every rule of diplomatic discourse and call into question solemn commitments given by accredited representatives of a sovereign government to our supreme court," he said in parliament Wednesday. "Our government has therefore insisted that the Italian authorities respect the undertakings they have given to the honorable supreme court and return the two accused persons to stand trial in India. If they do not keep their word, there will be consequences for our relations with Italy," he added. Indian external affairs spokesman Syed Akbaruddin said at a news briefing Thursday that the court action against the Italian ambassador did not violate the global Vienna convention on diplomatic relations. "As of today, I have again said, we do not see any impact on the Vienna convention," he said.

chatgpt: Two Italian sailors are set to face trial in India in connection with the killings of two Indian fishermen. The incident took place in 2012, off the coast of Kerala, when the sailors allegedly mistook the fishermen for pirates and opened fire on their boat.  The Supreme Court of India recently allowed the sailors to leave India on the condition that they would return to stand trial. However, the court has now demanded an explanation as to why the sailors have failed to return as promised, and has even gone so far as to bar the Italian ambassador's departure from India until the matter is resolved.  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has warned that India's relationship with Italy would suffer if the two sailors did not stand trial in India. Speaking at a recent press conference, Modi said, "We expect other countries to respect our legal and judicial processes, just as we respect theirs. If the two Italian sailors do not return to India to stand trial, there will be consequences for our relationship with Italy." The Italian government has expressed its concern about the situation and has urged India to allow the sailors to return home. Italy's Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying, "We regret the decision by the Indian authorities to not allow the Italian ambassador to leave India. We call on the Indian authorities to allow the sailors to return to Italy, as has been requested by the Italian government." The case has already been a source of tension between the two countries. In 2013, Italy raised the issue with the United Nations after the Indian authorities arrested the sailors. The UN's International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea later ruled that Italy had breached India's sovereignty by attempting to interfere in the case.  The trial is expected to proceed in India, even if the two Italian sailors are not present. The court will hear from witnesses and examine the evidence presented by both sides before reaching a verdict.  The incident has once again highlighted the complex issues surrounding maritime security and the use of force. The growing trend of piracy in the region has led to increased security measures, but incidents such as this one underscore the importance of adherence to rules of engagement and caution against the use of excessive force. The case is likely to have far-reaching implications for India-Italy relations, and will be closely watched by diplomats and legal experts alike. It is a reminder of the need for cooperation and mutual respect between nations, particularly in matters relating to law and justice.
