article: Police in Swaziland will enforce a colonial law to stop women wearing miniskirts and other 'sexual' clothing. Officers say the clothes 'encourage rape' (file picture) Women in Swaziland have been banned from wearing miniskirts and crop tops because they 'encourage rape' - and offenders face a six-month spell in jail. Police in Swaziland, the last absolute monarchy in Africa and an incredibly conservative nation, have resurrected an archaic colonial criminal act from 1889 to stop women wearing clothes that expose their body. Swazi police were responding to a march in the second city of Manzini last month by young women, some wearing miniskirts, who were seeking equal rights and safety. In Swaziland women are legal minors and two-thirds of teenage girls have been victims of sexual assault, according to the South African Independent Online. Police spokesperson Wendy Hleta warned: 'They will be arrested. 'The act of the rapist is made easy, because it would be easy to remove the half-cloth worn by the women. 'We do not encourage that women should be harmed, but at the same time people should note acceptable conduct of behaviour,' she said. The ban also applies to low-slung jeans and tank tops. However, the 'indlamu' costume, a tiny beaded belt worn when young women dance for King Mswati topless and with their buttocks fully exposed, is permissible, authorities declared. Hleta said this apparel is permissible because police have no records of any maiden being raped while wearing the costume.

Women have also been advised on a way to retrieve dropped objects that will not make them 'culpable' in their own assaults by 'exciting males'. Hleta said: 'For females it is polite that when you have dropped something, squat with your upper body still upright and pick up the item rather than bending half your body head first to pick up the item.' The Swazi police spokeswoman did not say whether a woman not following the guidelines for picking up a dropped object would be arrested or issued with a warning.

chatgpt: In a recent move, the police authorities in Swaziland have imposed a ban on miniskirts and low slung jeans. The authorities believe that such clothing encourages rape, and hence, they have made it illegal to wear them. This decision has been met with mixed reactions from the public. Swaziland is a tiny African kingdom that is known for its rich cultural heritage. The country has been struggling with the issue of rape for years now, and the authorities have been looking for ways to tackle the problem. According to the police, the prevalence of miniskirts and low slung jeans is one of the reasons behind the increasing incidents of rape in the country. The ban has been imposed under a colonial-era law which gives the authorities the power to regulate what people wear in public. The ban is not limited to women alone; men are also forbidden from wearing clothes that reveal too much skin. The decision has been welcomed by some members of the public who believe that it will help to reduce incidents of rape in the country. They argue that people should dress modestly to show respect for their culture and traditions. However, others believe that the ban is an infringement on their rights and freedom of expression. They argue that people should be allowed to wear whatever they want, as long as it does not harm anyone else. Interestingly, the ban does not apply to semi-naked dances performed for the country's all-powerful king. These dances are an important part of the country's cultural heritage and are exempt from the ban. Critics have accused the authorities of double standards, arguing that if the ban is intended to reduce incidents of rape, it should apply to everyone equally. They also point out that the semi-naked dances performed for the king can also be seen as a form of sexual objectification and should not be exempt from the ban. The ban has sparked a heated debate in the country, with many people calling for a more nuanced approach to the issue of rape. Some believe that the authorities should focus on education and awareness-raising campaigns instead of imposing a ban on clothing. In conclusion, the ban on miniskirts and low slung jeans in Swaziland has been controversial, with supporters arguing that it will help to reduce incidents of rape and critics accusing the authorities of double standards. The debate is likely to continue, as people grapple with the complex issue of rape and its underlying causes.
