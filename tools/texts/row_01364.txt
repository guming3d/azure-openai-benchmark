article: Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli authorities said Thursday that they have suspended a police officer who is accused of beating the U.S. teenager Tariq Abu Khdeir in Jerusalem last week. Amateur video emerged last week showing Israeli police officers holding down and punching 15-year-old Khdeir, a high school sophomore from Florida. The shocking footage prompted outrage from his family and calls by the U.S. government for a full and transparent investigation. Khdeir says he was arrested and accosted while watching violent protests in the Shuafat neighborhood last week over the kidnapping and killing of his cousin, the Palestinian teenager Mohammed Abu Khedair. The young man's killing came after three abducted Israeli teenagers were found dead in a field in the West Bank, sparking an upsurge in tensions in the region. Israeli authorities say Khdeir was among a group of youths who attacked police during the riots. He is currently under house arrest at a relative's home after being released on bail by a court. The Israeli Department for the Investigation of Police (DIP) said Thursday that after an investigation into the incident, it had found evidence to suspect one of the officers of committing "serious violent offenses" while Khdeir was handcuffed. The department's director is considering criminal charges against the officer, who is in a special undercover unit, and he has been summoned for a hearing, the agency said in a statement. The officer's suspension is for 15 days. But the DIP also said Khdeir was identified by police as wearing a mask, carrying a slingshot and taking an active part in the unrest in Shuafat. Khdeir and his family have denied he did anything wrong. "I was attacked by police. I woke up in the hospital," he said as he walked out of court in Jerusalem on Sunday, sporting two black eyes and a swollen lip. "I just saw somebody running at me, so I tried to run away," he told reporters. Khdeir said he didn't know why he was attacked. His mother has said the family intends to sue Israeli authorities over the matter. CNN's Tal Heinrich reported from Jerusalem, and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong.

chatgpt: An Israeli police officer is suspected of committing "serious violent offenses" after an investigation was conducted into the beating of a U.S. teen caught on video during protests in Jerusalem. Tariq Abu Khdeir, a high school student, claims he was attacked by Israeli police while participating in the protests. The investigation by Israeli authorities found that Khdeir was identified by police as participating in the protests and was then allegedly subjected to violence. The incident was captured on video and gained widespread attention as it showed Khdeir being brutally beaten by Israeli police officers. The police officer in question, who has not been named, is believed to have committed "serious violent offenses," according to Israeli authorities. The investigation into the incident is ongoing, and authorities have not yet made any arrests. The incident has caused outrage among Palestinians and has heightened tensions in the region. Palestinian leaders have called for an independent investigation into the incident and for the officer responsible to be held accountable. In response, Israeli authorities have defended the action of their police force, stating that they were responding to violent protests in the area. They also claim that Khdeir was participating in the protests and was carrying a weapon, which he allegedly used to attack Israeli police officers. The incident has led to calls for increased accountability and transparency in the Israeli police force. Critics argue that incidents of police violence towards Palestinians have been overlooked in the past and that a culture of impunity exists within the force. In recent years, there have been several incidents of police brutality against Palestinians in the region, which have sparked widespread protests and international condemnation. The incident involving Tariq Abu Khdeir has brought renewed attention to the issue and has raised questions about the effectiveness of Israeli authorities' responses to protests and civil unrest in the region. The investigation into the incident is ongoing, and it remains to be seen whether the police officer responsible will be held accountable for their actions. Nevertheless, the incident has once again highlighted the ongoing tensions and conflict in the region and the need for a peaceful resolution to the longstanding Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
