chatgpt: A group of students from St Martin’s Comprehensive in Caerphilly, South Wales, were looking forward to an exciting trip to New York City. However, their journey was met with an unexpected hiccup upon their arrival at John F. Kennedy International Airport on Saturday. Instead of being able to explore the iconic sights of the Big Apple, the group found themselves stranded at the Marriott Courtyard in Lyndhurst, New Jersey. Since Sunday, they have been confined to the hotel, unable to go out and explore the surrounding areas or see any of the attractions they had been looking forward to experiencing. The reason behind the group's predicament was the harsh winter weather that hit the East Coast a few days before their arrival, causing flight disruptions and cancellations throughout the region. According to one of the chaperones who spoke to a local news station, the group was initially stuck at JFK for seven hours before they were finally told that their flight was cancelled. With no tourism experience, the group was left scrambling to figure out what to do next. They eventually decided to book hotel rooms near the airport with the help of their travel agency, but soon after checking in, they were informed that they would have to move to the Marriott Courtyard in Lyndhurst. Despite the unexpected changes to their plans, the group has been trying to make the most of their time at the Marriott Courtyard. They have been keeping busy with activities such as quizzes, games, and movie nights organized by their chaperones. Local businesses and the hotel staff have also been stepping up to help alleviate the group’s unfortunate situation. One of the students, who spoke to a local news station, said that they were coping as best they could given the situation, and that they were grateful for the support they were receiving. However, the group also expressed their disappointment at not being able to see New York City, the main reason behind their trip. It is not yet known when the group will be able to head back home to Wales, as flight cancellations and disruptions continue to plague the East Coast. The group and their chaperones are hoping to make the most of their time at the Marriott Courtyard and are looking forward to eventually returning home safely. Overall, the situation faced by the students from St Martin’s Comprehensive in Caerphilly shows the impact that unexpected weather events can have on travel plans. While the group's trip did not go as planned, it is inspiring to see how they are making the best of the situation and how locals and businesses are coming together to show their support.
