article: A swimming official who had a sexual relationship with a promising young swimmer gave her a diamond ring and a sex toy, a Brisbane court has heard. The 57-year-old introduced himself to the girl's parents in 2010 as 'a man of means in terms of obtaining sponsorship' after watching her compete as a 14-year-old, the Brisbane District Court heard on Monday. With her parents' permission, he travelled with the girl to various international competitions throughout 2011 and by 2012 their relationship had become sexual with frequent contact over Facebook, text messages and Skype calls. A 57-year-old swimming official allegedly had a sexual relationship with a 14-year-old promising young swimmer . 'Even (her) parents noticed the increased interest of the defendant in their daughter,' Crown Prosecutor Phil McCarthy told the court on the first day of the trial. 'They will tell you they dismissed it as simply attentive interest in their exceptional child.' During a trip to New Zealand in late 2012, the man presented the swimmer with a purple vibrator, which he subsequently used on her, the court heard. The pair drank together in their hotel and the defendant was 'continually topping up her drink' before she eventually lost her virginity to him, Mr McCarthy said. During their relationship, the man gave her a diamond ring and a sex toy . The relationship soured in January 2013 when, also during a trip to New Zealand, the man entered her hotel room, pushed a couch against the door, tied her to the bed and assaulted her repeatedly. 'The event upset (her) greatly and she cried. (They) fought after the incident and she went to the balcony intent on ending her own life,' Mr McCarthy said. The girl's parents became aware of the relationship after intercepting a Facebook conversation in which she had confided in an older friend, the court heard. The defendant pleaded not guilty to eight counts of engaging in sexual intercourse with a young person outside Australia when in a position of trust or authority, and four counts of engaging in sexual activity other than intercourse. The 57-year-old introduced himself to the girl's parents in 2010 as 'a man of means in terms of obtaining sponsorship' after watching her compete as a 14-year-old . The man's defence team has submitted admissions including that he was aware of the girl's age at the time of their relationship. 'The critical issue anticipated in this trial is that the crown proving that (he) was indeed in a position of authority or trust at the time of the particular offending,' Mr McCarthy said. The man, who organised accommodation and travel for swimming teams, faces a five-day trial before Judge Brad Farr. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

chatgpt: A 57-year-old swimming official appeared in Brisbane Court after being accused of having a sexual relationship with a 14-year-old swimmer. The man, whose name has not yet been released, had gained the trust of the girl's parents by implying that he could provide sponsorship for their young competitor. During a swimming trip to New Zealand, the man gifted the girl a diamond ring and a purple vibrator. It’s allege that he then took the girl's virginity. The allegations have shocked and appalled the swimming community, with many expressing their disgust on social media. The man faces a five-day trial in Brisbane, where he will have to answer to charges of sexual misconduct with a minor. It is unclear at this stage how much the girl's parents knew about the relationship or whether they were aware of the gifts given by the man. However, it is expected that they will be called to give evidence during the trial. In a statement, Swimming Australia said that they were deeply concerned by the allegations and are taking the matter very seriously. "Swimming Australia has a zero-tolerance approach to any form of child abuse or misconduct, and we are committed to ensuring that our sport is a safe and supportive environment for all participants," the statement read. The case is just the latest in a string of allegations of sexual misconduct involving officials and athletes in the swimming world. In 2018, the USA Swimming organization was rocked by a widespread scandal involving the sexual abuse of young athletes by coaches and officials. In response, the organization launched a series of measures designed to protect athletes and punish those who engage in misconduct. Swimming Australia has also taken steps to protect its athletes, including the implementation of a Safe Sport Framework to ensure that all participants in the sport are supported and protected. The case of the 57-year-old swimming official is a disturbing reminder of the need for vigilance and safeguarding within sporting organizations. It is hoped that the trial will help to bring justice and closure to the young victim and her family, and send a strong message that sexual misconduct will not be tolerated in any form.
