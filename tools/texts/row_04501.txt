article: Amir Khan's car collection appears to have got even more impressive, after the boxer posed with a Lamborghini Aventador on his official Instagram account. Khan is a known car enthusiast and the addition of an Aventador would come as no surprise given that the 28-year-old already owns a Bentley Continental, a Mercedes CLS63, Audi R8 and two Rangers Rovers - because why wouldn't you have two? The Aventador retails at around £300,000 and boasts an incredible set of specs, managing 0-62mph in 2.9 seconds and reaching a top speed of 217mph.
