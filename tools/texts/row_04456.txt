article: They're known for their love of sleep, so tit's not surprising this koala was far from happy when it was rudely awakened with a drenching from a garden sprinkler. The furry creature, which rests for up to 18 hours a day, was fast asleep in a tree when it was soaked by a gardener watering his trees. And as these images show, the koala was more than a little peeved at its unexpected soaking. A wet wake-up call: This koala looks far from happy after being woken up from a nap when a gardener drenched it while watering his trees in Adelaide, Australia . The images were taken by Matt Wilkinson, 39, in the garden of his home in Adelaide, Australia. He said: 'There was a particular bad heatwave in Adelaide recently and temperatures reached up to 40C. 'The koalas hang around in a tree in my garden when it is hot, it's on the southern side of the house and relatively cool. "We use the sprinklers and garden hose to wet the house and surrounding trees when it's hot to avoid a bush fire but when I watered one of the trees, this koala got a bit of a soaking.' But while the koala may look far from happy about his soaking, Mr Wilkinson said it would have helped it cool off. He said: 'It was a boiling hot day so I'm sure it helped the koala cool down. Cooling off: But Matt Wilkinson, 39, who took the photographs of the animal, said the koala may have appreciated the soaking as it was an unusually hot day . 'Koalas usually don't need to drink, as they get their moisture requirements from gum leaves but on that day, the koala's were licking at the trunk of the tree where the water was trickling down. They were quite thirsty.' After accidentally drenching the animal, Mr Wilkinson quickly grabbed his camera before heading to the end of his garden to take these pictures. 'I wanted to use my camera to try and get a shot of the koala after wetting it down, so walked down and proceeded to snap away. 'Either the koala was curious, or wanted to thank me, as it climbed out along the tree branch and stayed at the end of it just looking at me. It even stuck its tongue out which helped me get some great photos.'

chatgpt: A sleepy koala was rudely awakened when Matt Wilkinson, a resident of Adelaide, accidentally soaked the napping marsupial while watering his trees. Known for their love of sleep, koalas can rest for up to 18 hours a day, but this particular koala was jolted awake when it was unexpectedly doused with water. The incident was captured on camera, showing the koala's reaction to the wake-up call. The photos show the koala looking startled and drenched, with water dripping from its fur. After getting soaked, the koala shook itself off and scampered up a nearby tree, seemingly unharmed. Wilkinson expressed his surprise at the scene, saying, "I was just watering the trees and the next thing I know, I've got a drenched koala on my hands." He added, "It's not every day you get to see a wild koala up close like this, but I do feel bad for waking it up from its nap." Koalas are an iconic symbol of Australia and are often associated with their relaxed and lazy nature. However, their love of sleep also plays a vital role in their survival. They have a low metabolic rate, which means they don't require much energy and can conserve it by sleeping for most of the day. Despite their calm demeanor, they are still wild animals and can become agitated when disturbed from their sleep. While it may be tempting to get close to these cute and furry creatures, it's important to remember that they are wild animals and should be admired from a safe distance. In fact, disturbing koalas in their natural habitat can be harmful to their health and wellbeing. According to experts at the Australian Koala Foundation, human activity is one of the biggest threats to koalas' survival. Habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as dog attacks and vehicle collisions, have all contributed to declining koala populations. The incident with the drenched koala serves as a reminder of the importance of respecting the natural world and its inhabitants. While it may be tempting to approach and interact with wild animals, it's crucial to do so with caution and respect for their space. Thankfully, in this case, the koala seemed to shake off the unexpected wake-up call with little harm done, and returned to its peaceful slumber.
