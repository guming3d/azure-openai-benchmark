article: It might be almost 200 years since the first wagons rolled their way towards the Pacific coast along the Oregon Trail, but it seems it still has as much of a draw with Americans looking for a better life. The state has topped a list for the most popular place to move to for the second year in a row. More than 66 per cent of the Oregon moves carried out by United Van Lines were people relocating to the state, rather than moving out. In comparison, 65 per cent of the people it served in New Jersey moved away, according to the company. Oregon's outdoor space is one of the reasons more people move to the state than leave it, it is believed (Pictured is the Three Sisters Wilderness Area, Willamette National Forest) Portland also has a lot to recommend it - including being one of the most innovative cities for urban planning . Economist Michael Stoll,  chairman of the Department of Public Policy at the University of California, said the figures reflected the overall trend in migration towards southern and western states. However, it is Oregon's 'unique amenities' which he believes push it to the top of the pile. These include outdoor recreation, arts and entertainment activities, and green space - which the mountainous state has plenty of. Travel Oregon, the state's tourist board, lists its own 'seven wonders' - including the Columbia River Gorge, to Crater Lake and the Wallowa Mountains. The cost of living is also 1.2 per cent lower than the American average, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Oregon was also named one of the top three states for job growth during 2013, while Portland was named one of the most innovative cities for urban planning, according to CNN Money. However, its education system was ranked 41 in the country by Education Week - with residents pointing to the state's lower-than-average spend on each student as a possible cause. South Carolina (pictured is Greenville) was named the second most popular place for people to move to . But 64 per cent of people moved in New Jersey were moving out of the state, rather than into it - making it the least popular in this year's list . However, while Oregon had the best moving in-out ratio, far fewer people decided to make their home in the state than elsewhere in America. United Van Lines moved 28,036 homes in California last year, with just over half moving into the state. This is in spite of the fact that those living in California need to earn, on average, $6,000 more than those living in Oregon - where the company had just 4,121 shipments in total. But Oregon was in no way the state with the lowest number of shipments  in the country: United Van Lines conducted only 325 shipments in Vermont, the fourth most popular destination for people to make their home.

chatgpt: A recent report from the United States Census Bureau has revealed that California is the most populous state in the country, with a staggering 39.5 million people residing there as of 2021. This puts it miles ahead of the second-place state, Texas, which is home to 29.5 million people. However, when it comes to the percentage of people moving into a state, it's a different story. According to the report, Idaho tops the table for the highest percentage of people moving into the state. This is not a new trend; Idaho has been growing in population over the last few years thanks to its affordable housing market and abundance of job opportunities. Many people have been attracted to the state's idyllic landscapes and outdoor activities, and its proximity to major cities like Seattle and Portland. Following Idaho on the list of states with the highest percentage of people moving in are Arizona, South Carolina, Oregon, and Montana. In contrast, New Jersey was named as the place that most people moved away from. This was in part due to its high cost of living and high property taxes, which have been known to drive people away. The Garden State has been losing residents for years, but this upward trend seems to be continuing, seeing about 38% of the population moving out. California, on the other hand, was found to be the most popular state in terms of sheer numbers of people. Despite its high cost of living and traffic-clogged cities, people keep moving to the Golden State in droves. California maintained its position at the top, retaining its spot as the most populous state despite its cost-of-living being the highest in the country. While California's high cost of living may deter some, the state's strengths - its thriving economy and picturesque natural surroundings - continue to make it an attractive destination for those in search of the ultimate American dream. In conclusion, while California may be the most populous state in the country, Idaho is the state to beat on a percentage basis for people moving in. The West Coast and the South seem to be the place where people are flocking the most, while the East Coast's high property taxes seem to be driving people away to more affordable locales. However, regardless of which state people choose to move to, the United States' status as the land of opportunity remains unchanged.
