chatgpt: Former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez is being kept in segregation from the general inmate population at the Bristol County Jail in Massachusetts. Hernandez, 24, has pleaded not guilty to the murder of Odin Lloyd, a 27-year-old semi-pro football player. According to reports, Hernandez is being held in a single cell in a special unit used to house high-profile inmates. The decision to segregate Hernandez was reportedly made due to his celebrity status and concerns about his safety. Hernandez has been charged with first-degree murder in the June 2013 death of Lloyd, whose body was found in an industrial park near Hernandez's home. Prosecutors have accused Hernandez of orchestrating Lloyd's murder, allegedly due to a dispute that arose at a nightclub. Hernandez's trial is set to begin on January 9, 2015. While Hernandez has maintained his innocence, his legal team has faced challenges in preparing a defense. In August 2013, a judge denied a request to suppress evidence obtained by investigators under search warrants, including surveillance footage from Hernandez's home and statements made by Hernandez's associates. Hernandez's legal team has also clashed with prosecutors over the handling of evidence, including a cell phone and a video camera. Despite these challenges, Hernandez's defense has vowed to fight the charges. In a statement released after Hernandez's indictment, his attorney said, "He looks forward to proving his innocence at trial and returning to his family and friends." Meanwhile, the case has attracted national attention due to Hernandez's status as a former NFL player. The Patriots released Hernandez shortly after he was arrested in June 2013, and he has been held without bail since then. With Hernandez's trial approaching, the case is likely to continue to garner attention. As the legal battle unfolds, fans and observers will be watching to see whether Hernandez can prove his innocence, and whether he will be able to resume his football career.
