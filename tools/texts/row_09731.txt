chatgpt: A Texas man has been found guilty of carving his nickname, 'Ace,' into the thighs of a 20-year-old woman before beating her and threatening to rape her with a knife. Joseph Julian Guerra, 28, was convicted after a two-day trial that included testimony from the victim, Margaret Dodd. According to Dodd's testimony, Guerra bound her hands and feet with duct tape before using a knife to carve his nickname into her skin. He then beat her with a metal skillet and threatened to rape her with the same knife he had used to carve his name into her. Dodd also testified that Guerra threatened to strangle her with a wrench during the attack. The brutal assault reportedly occurred in October 2018, and Guerra was arrested shortly thereafter. He was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, aggravated kidnapping, and robbery. He could face life in prison for his crimes. During the trial, Guerra did not deny attacking Dodd but claimed that he was under the influence of drugs at the time and did not remember much of what happened. The jury did not accept this defense and found him guilty on all counts. Dodd, who suffered significant physical and emotional trauma as a result of the assault, expressed relief at the verdict. "I'm so happy that justice was served," she said. "No one deserves to go through something like that." The case garnered national attention, with many expressing shock and outrage at the brutal nature of the crime. Some have pointed to it as an example of the need for stronger laws around domestic violence and assault. "We cannot allow individuals like Joseph Julian Guerra to commit these kinds of heinous acts and get away with it," said one advocate for victims of domestic violence. "We need to do more to protect those who are most vulnerable and hold perpetrators accountable for their actions." Guerra is scheduled to be sentenced in the coming weeks. Dodd and her supporters hope that his punishment will send a message to others who might consider committing similar crimes. "We need to make it clear that this kind of violence will not be tolerated," said Dodd.
