chatgpt: Tragedy struck a peaceful Spanish neighborhood yesterday morning when a man was buried alive while renovating his holiday home. Andrew McGaughey, a 65-year-old British homeowner, was buried to his neck when the ground gave way under him. According to eyewitnesses, the incident occurred early in the morning, while McGaughey was working on the property's outdoor patio. "We heard a loud scream," says neighbor Maria Hernandez. "When we went outside, we saw him buried up to his neck. He was shouting for help, and we could see the panic on his face." Emergency services were immediately called to the scene, but tragically, they were too late to save McGaughey. "By the time we arrived, he was already deceased," said a spokesperson for the local ambulance service. McGaughey was a father of two and had been looking forward to retiring in Spain. He had purchased the holiday home last year and had been working on it for several months. "He was a lovely man," said his neighbor, John Davis. "Always had a smile on his face, and he was so proud of his home." Despite the tragedy, his neighbors have rallied around his family, offering their condolences and support. "We're all devastated by what's happened," said Hernandez. "But we'll be there for his family, whatever they need." The cause of the accident is currently unknown, but it is suspected that heavy rainfall in the area may have weakened the ground beneath McGaughey. He was working alone at the time of the incident, and there were no witnesses to the exact circumstances of his burial. The incident has highlighted the importance of safety precautions when working on home renovation projects, especially in foreign countries with unfamiliar surroundings. "It's just a tragedy," said Davis. "I hope nobody ever has to go through something like this. We'll all miss him terribly." McGaughey's family is currently making arrangements to return his body to the United Kingdom for burial. The investigation into the cause of the accident is ongoing, and local authorities have issued a warning to homeowners to take extra precautions when renovating their properties. "We're urging people to be careful," said a spokesperson. "This is a terrible reminder of just how dangerous construction work can be."
