Tough: Five-time world wife carrying champion Taisto Miettinen carries Reetta Sairanen through a tough water obstacle during the event's final heat at Sunday River Ski Resort in Newry on Saturday . Powering over hurdles, ducking sand traps and pushing through a water hole alongside 50 other competitive couples, the dominant duo took home Sairanen's weight (89 pounds) in beer and five times her weight in cash ($445). Now they're set to compete in the World Wife Carrying Championship in Finland next year, according to Sun Journal. Miettinen has won the world championship five times, but with a different teammate. Asked the secret to wife carrying, Miettinen said, 'You must have power, you must be fast and you must have sustained strength...The woman’s weight, it is important.' South Paris' Jesse Wall and Christine Arsenault secured a place in the top three after setting the pace early in the race. Asked how they got into the sport, Wall said, 'I have a very little wife who said to me, ‘We’ve got to go try this, it will be a lot of fun.' Testing: Lee Jong Su, left, and Koo Ji Sung were one of several South Korean couples participating in Saturday's races. The teams were being filmed by a Korean crew for an upcoming television show .

The Castros were North American wife-carrying champions in 2009 . The tough participants hailed from the U.S., Europe and South Korea. The Korean teams were being filmed for an upcoming television show. The most popular method of carrying the woman, reportedly used by all winners to date, is called the 'Estonian' method. Wrapping the women's legs around the man's head and hanging upside-down behind them, Estonian-style apparently, is considered more comfortable than the classic piggyback or 'fireman' (over the shoulder).

chatgpt: A Finnish couple, Taisto Miettinen and Reetta Sairanen, have emerged victorious in the 14th annual North American Wife Carrying Championship, held on Saturday in Maine. The couple finished the grueling 278-yard obstacle course in just over 48 seconds, beating the rest of the 43 couples competing for the title.  For those unfamiliar with the sport, the objective is for one partner to carry the other, upside down, through an obstacle course that includes hurdles, water hazards, and various other challenges. The competition has its roots in Finland, where it is believed to have originated as a way for men to prove their strength and agility.  Miettinen and Sairanen, who have been participating in the competition for several years, were ecstatic about their win. According to Sairanen, "We trained hard for this and it feels great to finally win. We had a great time and look forward to coming back next year." In addition to the bragging rights that come with winning the championship, Miettinen and Sairanen also received a prize worth their weight in beer, along with five times Sairanen's weight in cash. As Sairanen weighed in at 115 pounds, this translates into a prize of over $1000 in cash and 575 pounds of beer. The North American Wife Carrying Championship has grown in popularity over the years, drawing participants from all over the continent. While the sport may seem unusual to outsiders, it has become a beloved tradition for many who enjoy the physical and mental challenges it presents. The event also draws a large crowd of spectators, who come to watch the spectacle and cheer on their favorite couples. Many enjoy the festive atmosphere, which includes food vendors, live music, and other entertainment. The success of the competition has also led to the creation of similar events in other parts of the world, including the World Wife Carrying Championship held annually in Finland. While the idea of carrying one's spouse through an obstacle course may seem like a strange pastime, for those who participate in the North American Wife Carrying Championship, it is an opportunity to push themselves to the limit and have a great time doing it.  As Miettinen and Sairanen prepare to head back to Finland, they leave behind a legacy of determination and perseverance that will inspire others to take up this unique and challenging sport. Who knows, maybe next year's champions are already in training, ready to take up the mantle and continue the tradition of the North American Wife Carrying Championship.
