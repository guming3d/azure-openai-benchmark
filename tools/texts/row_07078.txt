article: By . Hugo Duncan Economics Correspondent . The Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney, pictured has defended the 2.5 per cent rise in interest rates . The cost of a typical mortgage could jump by nearly £175 a month over the next three years, homeowners were warned yesterday. The Bank of England suggested interest rates are likely to rise to 2.5 per cent by early 2017 – five times the current level of 0.5 per cent. Such an increase would add £174 a month – or £2,088 a year – to a typical £150,000 standard variable rate mortgage. Although the move would benefit the millions of savers who have been hit by record rock-bottom rates since March 2009, many cash-strapped households are ‘vulnerable’ to higher borrowing costs. The central bank’s Governor Mark Carney said a rise of 2.5 per cent would cushion the blow because it is still half the average rate of 5 per cent seen before the financial crisis. There would be no fast return to pre-downturn levels, said the Canadian, adding: ‘The old normal is not the new normal. ‘The new normal is materially lower than the old normal.’ His comments came as a series of reports suggested the economic recovery is broadening. The Office for National Statistics said gross domestic product, the total size of the economy, rose 0.8 per cent between January and March. Business investment – which is seen as crucial to a balanced and sustainable recovery – jumped 5 per cent in just three months and was 10.6 per cent higher than a year earlier. A separate report by polling group GfK showed consumer confidence in May was at its highest level for more than nine years. Martin Beck, of economic forecasters the EY Item Club, said: ‘It looks like the UK growth engine is now firing on all cylinders.’ Households have frequently been warned that interest rate rises are imminent as the economy strengthens. Mr Carney, who was this week criticised for behaving like ‘an unreliable boyfriend’ for sending out mixed messages about when rates will go up, said the exact timing is not important. ‘The big picture is where interest rates go in the medium term, because if I am taking out a mortgage, that is what I care about,’ he said. The Bank of England suggested interest rates are likely to rise to 2.5 per cent by early 2017 ¿ five times the current level of 0.5 per cent . Mr Carney said 2.5 per cent rates are ‘not inconsistent’ with a full recovery. However, he said any increases will be ‘gradual’ and ‘limited’ – fearing that families struggling with mortgage repayments will harm the economy by reducing their spending. Figures from the Land Registry yesterday also showed the emergence of a ‘two-speed’ housing market between London and elsewhere in the UK. Average prices in the capital grew 18.5 per cent to £439,719, compared with a rise of just 0.9 per cent in the North East to £99,319.

chatgpt: The cost of a typical mortgage in the UK could increase by almost £175 a month within three years, according to recent reports. The sudden rise is expected to occur due to the increasing likelihood of a rise in interest rates, which is expected to impact homeowners across the country. Despite concerns over the impact on homeowners, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney argues that a rise in interest rates will ultimately benefit savers who have been impacted by rock-bottom interest rates since the 2009 financial downturn. While the move is unlikely to result in a fast return to pre-downturn levels, it is expected to be a step towards realigning the economy to a more sustainable level. The rise in interest rates could also result in a change in the current market conditions for mortgages, which have been marked by excessive competition among lenders in recent years. As prices increase, borrowers may find that they are no longer able to secure the same level of borrowing power, which could have a significant impact on the overall state of the economy. Despite concerns of a rise in mortgage payments, the Bank of England has undertaken initiatives to cushion the blow for homeowners. More specifically, Governor Carney has signaled that rates will increase gradually to assist homeowners to adjust to the changes before they fully take effect. But while paying more each month may be difficult for homeowners in the short term, a rise in interest rates could ultimately benefit the economy as a whole. By encouraging individuals to save more and spend less, the move could ultimately boost the country's overall economic stability. In light of these changes, it is also clear that the property market could undergo a significant shift in the coming years. With many individuals now needing to adjust to higher mortgage rates, the demand for property could be impacted, leading to a possible slowdown in the market. Despite this, however, Governor Carney remains confident that the UK economy will continue to grow and develop, and that the rise in interest rates will ultimately be a positive move for the country's overall economic stability. In conclusion, while the rise in mortgage rates may be difficult for homeowners in the short term, it is necessary for the UK economy to return to a more sustainable level. With the recent changes in the market, it is clear that the property market is likely to undergo significant changes in the coming years, with demand for property potentially slowing down. Nonetheless, the move will ultimately benefit savers who have been impacted by rock-bottom interest rates since the 2009 financial downturn and help the country to become more stable economically.
