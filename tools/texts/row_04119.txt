article: By . Jack Crone for MailOnline . Jailed uncle: Drunk Clarence W. Hairston, of Pennsylvania, was arrested after allowing his eight-year-old nephew to sit on his lap and steer his car . An extremely drunk driver was arrested clutching a can of beer behind the wheel of his car while his eight-year-old nephew sat on his lap to steer. Clarence W. Hairston, of Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, told police he was doing nothing wrong and 'was only letting the kids go for a drive' after the shocking incident on Saturday. The 58-year-old caught the attention of officers after they noticed his blue Chevy Impala blocking traffic as it stopped in the middle of the street outside his home. As they approached the vehicle, it began to make a series of 'stop and go' movements before narrowly avoiding a collision with a parked car, CBS Philly reports. When police eventually reached the car, officers were stunned to find Hairston in the driver's seat with his eight-year-old nephew sitting on his lap. Police say Hairston was operating the gas and brake pedals while drinking a can Bud Ice can. Meanwhile, his nephew was manning the steering wheel, with another nephew, aged nine, sitting in the back of the car. When Hairston got out, he was said to be unsteady on his feet and have blood-shot eyes and slurred speech while also smelling strongly of alcohol. After claiming to have done nothing wrong, he then suggested he was also a member of the Philadelphia Police Department, telling officers 'it's not right to jam up another cop'. It is believed Hairston was supposed to be babysitting his nephews, who were both returned to their mother unharmed. Upper Darby Police Superintendent, Michael Chitwood, said: 'I would have rather seen the kid take the car and drive away. 'Not only could he have endangered those two children in the car who apparently were his nephews but he could have endangered an entire community.' A woman who calls herself Hairston's fiancée has disputed the police's version of events, claiming he would never have put his nephews in danger. He is now facing a long list of charges that include driving under the influence, endangering the welfare of a child, recklessly endangering another person and permitting unauthorized person to drive and public drunkenness. He remains behind bars with a $15,000 cash bail.

chatgpt: A shocking incident took place in Pennsylvania on Saturday afternoon when police officers found a young boy in charge of driving a car while his adult companion enjoyed a beer inside. The bizarre episode happened in a quiet residential neighbourhood when Clarence W. Hairston was spotted by officers for making a series of "stop and go" movements while driving his Chevy Impala. Upon closer inspection, the police found a young boy in the driver's seat while Hairston was enjoying a Bud Ice inside the car. The boy, whose age is not mentioned, was under the legal driving age, and it was not clear how he came to be behind the wheel. The officers immediately arrested Hairston and charged him with reckless endangerment, among other charges. The situation became even more alarming when Hairston pretended to be a police officer when confronted by the officers. Although many questions remain unanswered, Hairston tried to justify his actions by saying that he was only letting the kids go for a drive. This excuse did not convince the officers, who considered it to be highly irresponsible and dangerous. The police discovered that Hairston had prior convictions for driving under the influence (DUI) and allowing an unlicensed driver to operate his car. They seized the car and took the young driver into protective custody. The incident raises serious concerns about the safety of young children and their exposure to alcohol and vehicles. Authorities have reminded parents and guardians that the legal driving age is 16 and that children under the age of 13 are not allowed to be left unattended in a car. Additionally, law enforcement officials are warning drivers against reckless driving and driving under the influence of alcohol. The incident has brought an outpouring of concern from the local community, with people expressing shock and disbelief at the outrageous incident. A resident from the neighbourhood, who wished to remain anonymous, said, "I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw a little boy driving the car. It's frightening to think what could have happened." The Pennsylvania State Police have confirmed that an investigation into the incident is currently underway. Clarence W. Hairston is currently being held on a $50,000 bail and is scheduled to appear in court on August 24. The young boy involved in the incident is now in the care of Child Protective Services.
