article: North Korea tour company, Experience North Korea, is showing for the first time at next week's World Travel Market in London. Not only is the Shanghai-based operator facing the usual challenge of promoting trips to the unpopular Communist country, but now, it's attempting to do so when North Korea has just closed its borders due to the Ebola scare. Nevertheless, the tour company remains optimistic ahead of their four day stint at the ExCeL exhibition centre. Shanghai-based North Korean tour company, Experience North Korea, will show for the first time at next week's World Travel Market exhibition in London . The company will be faced with a particularly hard sell this year as the unpopular Communist country has just closed its borders in the wake of the world Ebola scare . Nathalie Armengol, the owner of Experience North Korea, says: 'While we have not yet been given a timescale for the reopening of the border, we have been reassured it is a temporary issue until measures are put in place.' North Korea has never been a particularly easy sell as a tourist destination, as visitors are unable to travel there on their own and there are no mobile phone communications. Upon arrival, government tour guides accompany visitors at all time. Still, Armengol insists that visits are 'not only possible, but safe.' 'We want to change people's minds about North Korea,' she says. 'People are really surprised when they visit. You have to respect the rules and stay with your guides but you will see amazing beauty and untouched nature.' However, owner of Experience North Korea, Nathalie Armengol, insists that the border will open again soon . Nathalie insists visits to North Korea are 'safe' and that the tour company hopes to 'change people's minds' Many who visit North Korea are also surprised by the untouched nature and countryside, Nathalie says . The four-day travel trade exhibition begins on Monday, November 3 and is one of the largest tourism events in the world. A recent holiday confidence survey released ahead of the World Travel Market shows that there is a growing desire among job-secure Britons to plan overseas holidays within the next 12 months. But potential holidaymakers are still keeping an eye on their wallets - the amount individuals are expected to spend on trips will likely increase only marginally. From foreign exchange company First Rate Exchange and the Institute of Travel & Tourism, the survey showed that 10 per cent of the 5,017 adults polled planned to take more holidays over the next 12 months. 37 per cent intend to take two trips abroad compared with a figure of 35 per cent a year ago. But 24 per cent felt their holiday plans could be affected should interest rates rise.

chatgpt: North Korea, the unpopular Communist country, is set to make a first-time appearance this year at the World Travel Market in London. The event, which is a leading global travel trade exhibition, provides companies and nations with the opportunity to showcase their tourist attractions. However, just as the North Korean delegation was ready to leave for London, reports emerged that the country had closed its borders due to Ebola concerns. While this has put a dampener on the North Korean delegation's plans to promote the country's tourism industry, the government insists that it is only a temporary measure. The government has said that North Korea is a safe country to visit and that it is taking all necessary precautions to prevent the spread of the Ebola virus. According to the World Health Organization, there have been no confirmed cases of Ebola in North Korea. Despite the government's assurances, the decision to close borders has raised concerns among travel experts. The impact of the outbreak of Ebola has already been felt across the travel industry, with many tourists cancelling or postponing their trips to African countries, where the virus has been most prevalent. North Korea, which has long been considered a reclusive nation, has been making efforts in recent times to open up its tourism sector. The country has been offering guided tours to foreign visitors to showcase its history and culture, as well as its technological advancements. However, the country's tourism industry has been struggling to attract foreign visitors, largely due to the country's image as a closed-off and oppressive regime. North Korea is one of the world's most isolated countries, with stringent controls on information and movement, making it a challenging destination for tourists. North Korea's debut at the World Travel Market was seen as an opportunity for the country to improve its image and attract more tourists. However, the timing of the Ebola scare has put a damper on these plans. Despite this setback, North Korea remains optimistic about the potential of its tourism industry. The country's government has been investing heavily in infrastructure and hotel development to create a more welcoming environment for tourists. North Korea's presence at the World Travel Market may not yield immediate results, but it is a step forward in the country's efforts to open up its tourism industry. While the closure of the borders may have impacted the country's image, it is important to note that North Korea is not the only nation to have tightened its borders over Ebola concerns. As countries around the world struggle to contain the spread of the Ebola virus, the travel industry is likely to take a hit. For North Korea, the challenge will be to continue its efforts to attract tourists while reassuring potential visitors about the safety of the country.
