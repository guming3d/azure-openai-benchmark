article: The last time Rafael Nadal came back from a long-term layoff, he enjoyed one of the finest seasons of an outstanding career -- reaching nine consecutive finals on his return from a knee injury, and winning both the French and U.S. Open grand slams in 2013. On Tuesday, the Spaniard took to the court for the first time in three months and looked as though he had never been away as he blitzed past Frenchman Richard Gasquet at the China Open. Needing just 78 minutes to win 6-4 6-0 in the opening round, the world No. 2 appeared to feel no effects of the right wrist injury he suffered while practicing at home in Mallorca in late July. "In general, I have to be happy the way that I played," Nadal, a 14-time grand slam winner, told the official ATP Tour website. "After three months without a match, winning against a good player like Richard is a very positive comeback for me. I think I played solid, no mistakes." Nadal, who presented Li Na with a bouquet of flowers as China said goodbye to its biggest tennis star on Tuesday, had not played since his surprise fourth round defeat by Australian Nick Kyrgios at Wimbledon on July 1. His problematic wrist meant he was unable to defend his title at this month's U.S. Open, where Croatia's Marin Cilic emerged as a surprise winner. "More important than winning or losing is spending time on court. That's the key for me at the moment: spending time on court, playing matches," said Nadal. "At least I am going to play two matches minimum here. That's a positive thing. I'm going to try my best to play three." The 28-year-old has returned to action even though he says his wrist is not quite 100% healed. Nadal has a decent record in Beijing -- having won the China Open in 2005 and Olympic gold in 2008. Last year, he finished runner-up as Novak Djokovic won his fourth China Open title. The Serb took his record in Beijing to 20-0 when beating Guillermo Garcia-Lopez 6-2 6-1 as Djokovic played his first match since being stunned by Japan's Kei Nishikori in the U.S. Open semifinal.

chatgpt: Rafael Nadal made a successful return to the tennis court on Tuesday at the China Open in Beijing. The Spaniard defeated Richard Gasquet, 6-4, 6-3, in his first match back after being sidelined for three months due to a right wrist injury. Nadal had been forced to withdraw from multiple tournaments during his layoff, including the U.S. Open, where he was unable to defend his title. His return to the China Open was highly anticipated, as fans and analysts alike were eager to see if the injury had affected his game. Despite some visible traces of rustiness, Nadal was able to overcome Gasquet in straight sets. The world number 2 was aggressive throughout the match, striking 22 winners and converting three out of five break point opportunities. "I'm very happy for the victory, of course. It's a good start," Nadal said after the match. "I need to improve things, but I think that's something normal. Without playing for the last three months and coming back, it's not easy to play that well." Nadal's win comes after a frustrating period for the 19-time Grand Slam champion. His injury was a serious setback for the Spaniard, who had enjoyed a strong season prior to the setback. He had reached the semifinals of the Australian Open, won the French Open, and finished as the runner-up at Wimbledon. With the China Open now underway, Nadal will look to build on his victory over Gasquet and push towards the later rounds of the tournament. He will face Karen Khachanov of Russia in the second round. If he is able to continue his strong form, it could set the stage for a showdown with world number one Novak Djokovic, who is also competing in Beijing. Nadal's absence from the game was noticeable, as he is one of the most popular and talented players on the tour. His return was met with enthusiasm and excitement from fans and his fellow players, who have missed his dominating presence on the court. With a successful comeback under his belt, Nadal will now focus on his upcoming matches and aim to reclaim his place at the top of the tennis world.
