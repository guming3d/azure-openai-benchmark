article: By . Sam Creighton . Italians are known for their generous portions at dinnertime but one family restaurant has taken it to a whole other level. La Famiglia Giorgio's Ristorante, an Italian restaurant in Boston, Massachusetts, has seen more than half a million people take on its Lasagne Challenge over the last 23 years - that averages out at more than 60 people a day - but only 15 have finished the 7,000 calorie feast.

If they fail, as almost everyone does, they have to fork out $40.90 (Â£24) for their trouble. The last successful attempt was more than a year ago.

chatgpt: La Famiglia Giorgio's Ristorante is a Boston-based Italian restaurant that has caught the attention of locals and tourists alike with its infamous lasagne challenge. Only 15 people have managed to clear their plates, out of the more than 500,000 attempts made. The rules of the challenge are simple. Contestants who order the lasagne have just one hour to finish the entire dish, which weighs in at around 10 pounds. Those who successfully clear their plate will win the meal for free, along with a coveted t-shirt. However, the vast majority of people who have attempted the challenge have fallen short, struggling to get halfway through the enormous serving. Despite the challenge's difficulty, contestants continue to flock to the restaurant to try their luck. Some come in groups to tackle the lasagne together, while others test their stomachs alone. Regardless of the outcome, Restaurant Manager Albert Giorgio says it's "hilarious watching people fail". Giorgio initially created the lasagne challenge as a fun marketing stunt, never imagining it would become such a hit. However, the challenge's popularity has exceeded his expectations, with people travelling from all over the country just to try their luck. Some contestants have even turned the challenge into a personal competition, attempting it multiple times in an attempt to beat their previous record. Winning the challenge requires more than just a hearty appetite, as many contestants don't realize just how difficult it is until they start eating. According to Giorgio, the key is to have a well-thought-out strategy and to pace oneself. Additionally, he recommends bringing a group of friends to help with the daunting task.
