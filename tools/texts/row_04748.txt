Coachella Valley High School in California is being pressured to abandon their 'offensive and stereotypical' football mascot by an anti-discrimination group. The snarling, black-bearded mascot wearing a headscarf has been urging fans to root for the Southern Californian team, in the desert town just east of Palm Springs since the 1920s . But The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee recently sent a letter to officials at the Coachella Valley Unified School District asking them to get rid of the mascot - arguing that its 'large nose, heavy beard and Arab head covering' is offensive. An anti-discriminating group wants Coachella Valley High School to remove this snarling, black-bearded mascot . 'By allowing continued use of the term and imagery, you are commending and enforcing the negative stereotypes of an entire ethnic group, millions of whom are citizens of this nation,' Abed Ayoub, the group's director of legal and policy affairs, wrote in the letter. The request comes amid mounting pressure for the NFL's Washington Redskins to change its mascot because it's offensive to American Indians. The Arab mascot has been around since the 1920s and was chosen to recognize the area's reliance on date farming, traditionally a Middle Eastern crop. The nearby community of Mecca also pays homage to the Middle East. The mascot has evolved from a turban-wearing horseman carrying a lance to a standing figure with a scowl and a headscarf. The current mascot is based on an 'angry Arab' design from the 1950s, The Desert Sun reported. Coachella Valley High School's mascot, 'Arab', gives the thumbs during a game against Yucca Valley, in Thermal, California . Superintendent Darryl Adams said the topic will be discussed at a Nov. 21 school board meeting. He said he was taken aback by the 'Arab' name when he first was hired two years ago. 'Being an African-American from the Deep South, I'm sensitive to stereotyping,' Adams told the newspaper. 'But in this context, when this was created it was not meant in that way. It was totally an admiration of the connection with the Middle East.' Adams said the letter from the anti-discrimination group was the first time the school had been criticized for stereotyping in the past two years. Some school alumni have defended the mascot, saying it's a matter of pride. 'There was no intention to demean Arabs or be discriminatory in any way,' said David Hinkle, a 1961 graduate. 'I don't think it's right to decide now that you can't do that anymore. It is political correctness run amok, I would say.' Coachella Valley High School isn't the only institution using a controversial mascot - The Palm Springs High School mascot is the 'Indians' and Indio High features 'Rajah' - a turban-wearing Indian prince.

chatgpt: The small town of Oakridge has long been known for its thriving date farms. In recognition of this, the local school board recently selected a new mascot - a figure with a headscarf and scowl, designed to represent the area's reliance on the traditionally Middle Eastern crop. However, not everyone is thrilled with this decision. The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee has criticized the mascot, saying that it perpetuates harmful stereotypes and sends a message of intolerance. At the heart of the issue is the mascot's evolution. Originally, it was depicted as a horseman wearing a turban - a nod to the area's cultural heritage. However, in recent years, it has been updated to feature a figure with a headscarf and scowl. This change was made with good intentions - an effort to better reflect the modern-day reality of Oakridge. Many of the local date farmers are now women, and the headscarf was seen as a way to honor their contributions. Despite this, some feel that the new mascot is still problematic. The headscarf, they argue, is often associated with oppression in Western culture, and the scowl only reinforces negative stereotypes about Arabs and Muslims. The controversy has led to calls for the school board to reconsider their decision. A public meeting is scheduled for later this month, where community members will have the opportunity to voice their concerns. Some argue that the mascot is a harmless tradition, and that those who are offended by it are being too sensitive. They say that it is important for Oakridge to honor its cultural heritage, and that the mascot does just that. Others, however, see it as a larger issue of representation and inclusivity. They say that the mascot sends a message that only certain cultural traditions are welcome in Oakridge, and that those who do not fit into that mold are outsiders. The debate over the Oakridge mascot is just one example of the ongoing struggle for cultural understanding and acceptance throughout the United States. It remains to be seen how the school board will respond to the criticism, and whether or not the mascot will remain in its current form.
