article: Overweight people should be given free bikes on the NHS to get them fit, a former Tour de France great has said. Chris Boardman, the former Olympic cycling champion, said the move would be better for tackling obesity than giving out gym passes. Doctors can already write prescriptions for obese people to go to exercise classes. Scroll down for video . Chris Boardman (right) - pictured with the bike-fan Mary Creagh, Labour's shadow transport secretary - has called for fat people to take up cycling . But Mr Boardman – who won a gold medal in the 1992 Olympics – said forcing people to go to the gym put people off taking exercise. He told the Sun: ‘The problem with those solutions is that they bolt on to your life so they’re a chore. ‘If you can build an activity almost subconsciously into getting around then it happens organically. And that’s sustainable. Chris Boardman won a gold medal in the individual pursuit in the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona . ‘If I want to go to the gym I come in some nights and I’m tired and I can’t be bothered. If when I come in I’ve just done three or four miles home, I’ve already done my exercise. ‘The vast majority of journeys in this country are less than five miles. Thirty per cent are less than two miles and still the preference is to make them by car. ‘So if it becomes part of the fabric of my life I’m going to do it.’ He added: ‘The Department of Health should be screaming at the top of its voice and banging on doors saying for God's sake if people want to ride bikes, get everything out of their way and we’re all going to benefit.’ Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, backed Mr Boardman’s idea. He said cycling would help overweight Brits keep their weight down. Mr Fry said: ‘Bicycling helps all the muscle groups. It is a brilliant exercise - but it has to be done responsibly. GPs will have to make sure patients have had the right training and wear helmets.’ Mr Boardman, one of British Cycling’s star advisors, has urged ministers to commit to spending £10 a person every year on improving cycling safety.

chatgpt: Former Olympic champion Chris Boardman has stated that cycling is a superior form of exercise when compared to going to a gym. Boardman's comments come amid a trend among doctors who are prescribing exercise classes for their patients. However, the ex-cyclist has pointed out that gym sessions are often perceived as a "chore" by many people. Boardman, who won gold at the 1992 Olympics, has become an advocate for cycling as a means of improving physical and mental health. The former athlete claims that cycling can provide a more enjoyable and accessible way for people to stay active, compared to the often repetitive and monotonous experience of a gym. Doctors have already been prescribing exercise classes to patients suffering from conditions such as heart disease, depression, and obesity. These classes have been found to improve patients' physical and mental health, reducing the need for medication. However, Boardman argues that attending a gym is not the most effective way to motivate people to exercise regularly. Many people find the sterile and often intimidating atmosphere of a gym to be off-putting, which can lead to a lack of motivation and ultimately, failure to maintain a healthy exercise regime. Cycling, on the other hand, can be done almost anywhere, making it a more accessible option for many people. Boardman has said that cycling provides a sense of freedom and adventure that is often absent from gym sessions. Additionally, cycling can be incorporated into everyday activities, such as commuting to work or running errands, making it a more practical choice for many people. Boardman's comments reflect a broader trend towards outdoor activities that offer both physical and mental benefits. As more people become aware of the benefits of regular exercise, they are exploring alternative forms of activity that are more engaging and enjoyable. In conclusion, while doctors are increasingly prescribing exercise for their patients, Chris Boardman believes that cycling offers a more enjoyable and accessible form of physical activity than going to a gym. By making exercise more engaging and accessible, people are more likely to stick to a regular exercise routine, leading to improved physical and mental health outcomes.
