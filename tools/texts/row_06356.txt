chatgpt: Newcastle United FC is on the prowl for a new head coach after Alan Pardew parted ways with the team. John Carver had stepped up to the plate as caretaker for the past two matches, but the club is eager to find someone to take over the role on a permanent basis.  One of the names that have been tossed around as a potential candidate for the position is Glenn Hoddle. However, the ex-England boss has recently distanced himself from that possibility, insisting that he is content with his current position as a first-team coach at Queens Park Rangers (QPR). Hoddle spoke to the press about his future with QPR, saying, "I'm enjoying what I'm doing here, working alongside excellent staff and helping the team as much as possible. The job at Newcastle is certainly an attractive one, but I'm not considering leaving QPR right now." Hoddle's statement puts an end to speculation about the 58-year-old returning to the Premier League. Newcastle United has been in desperate need of a head coach since Pardew left to join Crystal Palace. The Magpies' recent form has been abysmal since then, with the team losing six of its last eight matches, including a humiliating 4-0 defeat to Southampton on St. Stephen's Day. Newcastle United director of football, Joe Kinnear, has his work cut out for him after the team's poor run of form. Kinnear has stated that he wants to bring in someone who can help turn the team's fortunes around and bring back the flair that the Newcastle faithful have come to expect. The club has made several attempts in recent weeks to find a suitable replacement, but nothing has materialized yet. Speculation had increased that Hoddle could take the reins, given his experience as a player and coach in the Premier League. However, Hoddle's decision to remain at QPR and turn down the opportunity to manage Newcastle could be a blow to their efforts to find a replacement for Pardew. Newcastle United players and fans alike will be hoping that Kinnear will be able to work his magic and bring in someone who can deliver results. The club's supporters have grown tired of the lackluster performances, and are hoping for a change in fortunes in the new year. Newcastle is set to take on Burnley on New Year's Day, with John Carver expected to remain in charge for the match. Carver has stated that he is willing to take charge of the team until their new head coach is appointed. The Magpies faithful will be hoping that the search for a new head coach won't drag on for too long, with the team in dire need of a new direction and impetus after a run of disappointing performances.
