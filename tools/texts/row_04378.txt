As most of the U.S. freezes and the UK drowns in floods, a blistering heat wave in Australia is so bad 100,000 cooked bats have fallen out of the sky, dead. Southern Queensland is being gripped by furnace-like temperatures, said the local RSPCA. This has in turn caused mass deaths with at least 25 separate colonies wiped out since the weekend, including at Mt Ommaney, Redbank, Boonah, Palmwoods, Laidley and Gatton. A blistering heat wave in Australia is so bad 100,000 cooked bats have fallen out of the sky . RSPCA spokesman Michael Beatty says the heatwave was a significant hit to the population of bats across the state, reports the ABC news station. 'The heatwave was basically a catastrophe for all the bat colonies in south-east Queensland,' he said. 'That's obviously going to have a pretty disturbing impact on those colonies and those colonies are vital to our ecosystem.' The smell of bat carcasses has caused problems for locals. The Scenic Rim Regional Council, west of Brisbane, has organised rubbish collectors to clear up the carcasses of about 2,000 bats. Residents near Boonah's Athol Terrace lookout say they have been putting up with the stench of the dead animals for four days. Southern Queensland is being gripped by furnace-like temperatures, said the local RSPCA . The clear-up: At least 25 separate colonies have been reported dead since the weekend . Hundreds of bats also lie dead in trees and nearby bushes, and are being eaten by maggots. The council today advised local residents it will not send workers into nearby bushland to collect the remaining bat carcasses, as it could cause further disruption to the nearby colony. One resident has told ABC she is receiving anti-viral treatment after being scratched by a baby bat while clearing the dead animals out of her tree with a rake. RSPCA spokesman Michael Beatty says the heatwave was a significant hit to the population of bats across the state, reports the ABC news station . Further north, Lockyer Valley Regional Council says it also faces a massive task of cleaning up thousands of dead bats from around Laidley and Gatton. Sunshine Coast Regional Council has sent workers out to collect thousands more dead bats near Palmwoods. At least 16 people across south-east Queensland are receiving anti-viral treatment after coming into close contact with a bat. Queensland Health is advising people not to touch the animals and to call authorities for help in clearing them away. Sammy Ringer from Bat Rescue echoed those concerns, saying it was best to call a wildlife volunteer or a vet. 'Don't touch them, they're stressed,' she said. 'If they do bite or scratch you and break the skin you can get a vaccination, you can get a shot for the lyssavirus.'

chatgpt: Southern Queensland is currently experiencing an intense heatwave, with temperatures soaring to furnace-like levels. The sweltering conditions have taken a significant toll on the local bat population, with reports of at least 25 separate colonies being wiped out. According to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), the heatwave has been a devastating hit to the bat population in the region. These flying mammals are particularly vulnerable to extreme temperatures, and the prolonged exposure to intense heat has caused significant harm to their health and wellbeing. In the wake of the heatwave, the RSPCA has been working hard to support the affected bat colonies. Efforts have included providing hydration stations and cooling misting systems to help alleviate the effects of the heat on the bats. However, despite these measures, the number of bat colonies affected has continued to rise. The RSPCA has been urging locals to do what they can to support the bats during this difficult time. This includes providing water and shelter for the animals, as well as avoiding any activities that may disturb or harm them. Additionally, the RSPCA has been working with local authorities to explore other measures that can be taken to help protect the bat population from the heat. The destruction of bat colonies is concerning on many levels. Bats play a crucial role in the ecosystem, helping to pollinate plants and control insect populations. Additionally, the loss of these colonies can have a significant impact on the local economy, as aviators who rely on the bats for crop pollination and pest control are left without a vital resource. The RSPCA has been working closely with researchers and other organizations to better understand the effects of the heatwave on the bat population. This research will help to inform future efforts to protect the creatures from the effects of climate change and other external factors that threaten their survival. Despite the devastation caused by the heatwave, there are hopeful signs that the bat population in Southern Queensland could recover. Through efforts like those led by the RSPCA, more and more people are becoming aware of the importance of these animals to the local ecosystem and the broader global environment. As awareness grows, it is hoped that more resources will be directed towards conservation and preservation efforts that can help to ensure a bright future for the bat population and the environment as a whole. In conclusion, the current heatwave in Southern Queensland has had a devastating impact on the local bat population, with at least 25 separate colonies being wiped out. The RSPCA is working hard to provide support, and is urging locals to do what they can to help protect the bats during this difficult time. While there are many challenges ahead, there are also reasons for hope, as awareness grows of the vital role these fascinating creatures play in our ecosystem and the need for concerted efforts to protect their future.
