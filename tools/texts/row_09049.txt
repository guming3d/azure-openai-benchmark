Nearly 2,500 bankers in Britain earn more than a million euros a year despite the financial crisis, figures showed yesterday. A report by the European Banking Authority, an industry regulator, revealed that 2,436 UK bankers were paid at least €1million, or £865,000, in 2011. There were three times more millionaire bankers in Britain than in the rest of the EU combined. Just 739 on the continent were classified as ‘high earners’. Germany was ranked second in the bankers’ pay league with 170 earning over a million euros. France was third with 162. UK bankers pointed out that the figures reflected London’s status as a leading global financial centre. The capital dwarfs rival centres such as Frankfurt and Paris in both the number of workers employed and the amount of business done. But critics said it showed the culture of ‘risk and excess’ was still alive and well in the City. The industry has been rocked by scandals since the financial crisis plunged Britain into its longest downturn for a century. Lenders also stand accused of starving businesses of the cash they need to grow, create jobs and power an economic recovery. The EBA said the 2,436 UK bankers were paid a total of £679million in basic salaries and £2.35billion in bonuses. It meant they earned an average of £1.24million each – down from £2million in 2010 but still 47 times more than the average salary for a full-time worker in the UK, which is £26,500. The High Pay Centre, a group that campaigns against excessive wages, said the fall from 2010 to 2011 was ‘encouraging’. But Luke Hildyard, head of research at the centre, added: ‘We don’t know what has happened in 2012 and the first half of 2013 as the stock market rallied. You wonder whether that trend has continued. There were three times more millionaire bankers in Britain than in the rest of the EU combined. Just 739 on the continent were classified as 'high earners' ‘And we shouldn’t break out the violins for the bankers. We are still looking at a hell of a lot of money. ‘The bonus culture created a culture of invincibility where bankers thought they were above the law. They put ethics aside in pursuit of bonuses. ‘It also increased inequality and created a culture of risk and excess in the City. These bonuses have not come down enough.’ The report underlined the dominance of London and the UK when it comes to high pay in banking. It showed that in eight of the 28 countries reported on, no bankers at all received more than a million euros. ring to push through new rules from Brussels to cap bonuses after next year.

chatgpt: New research has revealed that a staggering 2,436 bankers in the UK were paid at least £865,000 in 2011. This figure equates to around 8% of all UK bankers, highlighting the significant wealth being generated by the industry. The study, carried out by the European Banking Authority, surveyed data on the top earning bankers in 20 European Union countries. Within the UK, the report found that the highest-paid bankers were located in London, with 2,122 of the 2,436 earning the vast majority of their income in the capital. The remainder were spread across the rest of the country. The report has reignited the debate around bankers' pay and the growing wealth gap between the financial services sector and the rest of the UK workforce. It is also expected to put pressure on UK banks to follow the example of their European counterparts, which have already taken steps to cap the salaries of their highest-paid employees. Many critics argue that the excessive pay being doled out to bankers is unjustified, especially in light of the 2008 global financial crisis, which was triggered in part by the reckless actions of bankers working in London's financial district. The report's findings are likely to add fuel to the growing calls for greater regulation of the banking industry and more stringent controls on bankers' remuneration. There is also concern that such excessive executive pay is having a corrosive effect on the wider economy. With top bankers commanding such high salaries, it is argued that there is less money available for investment in other sectors of the economy, such as manufacturing and infrastructure, which are considered to be the backbone of sustainable growth. The UK's banking industry has already come under fire for its perceived lack of transparency on executive pay. In 2013, the UK government introduced legislation requiring banks to publish the salaries of their top executives, but many critics argue that the figures are still not transparent enough. The report's findings are also likely to resonate beyond the UK borders, with growing discontent around the world over executive pay and the wider consequences of rising income inequality. Many countries have already introduced measures to counteract the increasing concentration of wealth in the hands of a few, and the UK may soon be forced to follow suit. While the debate around executive pay is likely to rumble on, the UK's banking industry is facing other challenges. The continuing uncertainty around Brexit, for example, is weighing heavily on the sector, with many banks considering relocating to other EU member states in order to maintain access to the single market. Overall, the report's findings are likely to add further pressure on the UK's banking industry, and may lead to renewed calls for greater regulation and transparency. As the debate around executive pay continues, many observers will be watching closely to see how banks respond to growing public discontent.
