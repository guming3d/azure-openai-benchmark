article: LONDON, England (CNN) -- Building upon the success of the Green Week franchise, CNN International expands its environmental coverage this year with special Earth Day reports on April 22, and plans additional specials in July and October and a series of comprehensive reports around the Copenhagen Climate Conference in December. On Earth Day, Wednesday April 22, CNN International's special coverage, "Going Green," will showcase the network's extensive global resources with an array of reports and live coverage of Earth Day events around the world. From specific signature newscasts to business shows, the network will focus its attention on everything green and help make sense of what it means to be green today. In addition, CNN International will change the network's signature red logo to green during the coverage. "CNN International is committed to green coverage," said Katherine Green, senior vice president of CNN International. "It is a topic that resonates with our viewers and with our correspondents. We have reporters all over the world. They find stories no else can. This allows us to give our viewers a true global picture of the environmental issues and solutions." The network's business programs, 'World Business Today' and 'Quest Means Business', will focus on the business of going green. From the CEO of an up-and-coming green company to a climate change skeptic, these programs will speak to a variety of people to offer viewers many perspectives on green topics. Throughout the day, CNN International will engage their international audiences asking them what they are doing to be green. iReport correspondent, Errol Barnett, will solicit iReports and ask viewers to describe what they have done to "go green" in the past year. He'll also share those iReports throughout the day in special segments across CNN International's programs. On Saturday, April 25 at 1300 BST and Sunday, April 26 at 0100 and 1900 BST, a special programme, 'Your Green World', will focus on the current state of green initiatives around the planet. Correspondents from different parts of the world will report on how the current concern over the state of the environment touches the lives of global citizens. The special will explore many stories, including an initiative in Jakarta, Indonesia that promotes the planting of trees before a couple can get married, and a US recycling plant that tackles financial hurdles brought by the country's financial downturn.

The reports are part of the network's ongoing commitment to environmental coverage and its mission to raise awareness about the critical issues facing our planet. In addition to the Earth Day specials, CNN has also announced plans for two additional specials in July and October. These specials will focus on specific environmental issues and will include in-depth reporting and expert analysis. One of the most significant events that CNN plans to cover is the upcoming Copenhagen Climate Conference, which is set to take place in November. The conference will bring together world leaders to discuss the pressing issue of climate change and to develop strategies to combat it. CNN's coverage of the conference will be extensive, with in-depth reporting from the event and interviews with key leaders and influencers. The network aims to provide viewers with a comprehensive understanding of the conference's outcomes and its implications for environmental policy worldwide. The Copenhagen Climate Conference follows on from the 2015 Paris Agreement, where countries came together to make commitments to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. CNN played a significant role in covering the Paris Talks, providing extensive coverage of the negotiations and the resulting historic agreement. CNN also plans to focus on various other environmental issues as part of its ongoing coverage. This includes renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, and the management of natural resources. By highlighting these issues, CNN hopes to stimulate public interest and engagement on environmental issues and inspire action towards a sustainable future. The network's commitment to environmental coverage is reflected in its partnership with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) through its Media for Environment, Science, Health and Agriculture (MESHA) initiative. The initiative provides training to journalists on environmental issues and encourages responsible reporting on environmental topics. Overall, CNN's continued commitment to environmental coverage is essential in raising awareness about the issues affecting our planet and encouraging action to address them. The network's Earth Day specials, as well as its coverage of the Copenhagen Climate Conference and other environmental issues, will undoubtedly contribute to public understanding and highlight the importance of sustainability for future generations.
