article: (CNN) -- How eager are retailers to boost sales this holiday season? It's no longer enough for them to offer one special day of discounts to online shoppers -- they're stretching the deals out over an entire week. While retailers are still trumpeting deals for this Monday after Thanksgiving, many such as Amazon, Target and Walmart are now promoting some version of "Cyber Week" and extending Web-only deals through next weekend. The online discounts apply to all types of items, from appliances to clothes to consumer electronics. Walmart, for example, says it will offer 200 deals on its website each day through Friday, plus free shipping on all orders over $35. Not to be outdone, Amazon is promising new deals as often as every 10 minutes through Saturday, along with free shipping on "eligible orders" of $35 and over (it's not clear how they define "eligible.") In fact, if you're not getting free shipping on your online purchases this week, you may want to shop elsewhere. Clothing chains such as H&M, Gap and Banana Republic also are offering storewide Cyber Monday discounts of 40%. It's not always clear whether Cyber Monday discounts are much greater than what retailers offer online during other sale events. Also, supplies may be limited. Here's a sampling of some online deals being advertised for Cyber Monday (and in many cases, the rest of the week): . -- Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet with 16GB of storage: $399, down from $499 (Amazon) -- Canon Powershot A3500 16MP digital camera with 5x optical zoom (red model only): $99, down from $199 (Target) -- HTC One 32GB smartphone: 1 cent (it's normally $199), with two-year contract from AT&T, Verizon or Sprint (Amazon) -- 46-inch Samsung LED TV: $478, marked down from $949 (Walmart) -- Kindle Fire HD 16 GB tablet: $119, down from $169 (Amazon) -- Jawbone Jambox Bluetooth rechargeable portable speaker: $69, down from $199 (eBay) -- HP Pavilion 15-N066US 15-inch laptop: $459, down from $649 (Staples) -- Motorola Moto X smartphone: $349 without a contract, down from $499. The discount is available for all carriers and for both 16GB and 32GB models, although Motorola says supplies will be limited. -- Dyson DC41 Multifloor Bagless Upright Vacuum: $399, down from $549 (Best Buy) -- Craftsman 192-piece mechanics tool set: $99, down from $199 (Sears) -- Select coats from Kenneth Cole, Calvin Klein, DKNY and London Fog: 50% off, plus free shipping on online purchases of $75 or more (Macy's) -- Half off select men's and women's clothes and accessories (Target) The term Cyber Monday was coined in 2005 by a division of the National Retail Federation with the thinking that shoppers, after browsing in stores over Thanksgiving weekend, would wait to make online purchases Monday from their offices, where they had faster Internet connections. That notion is somewhat outdated now because 70% of Americans have high-speed broadband Internet service at home, not to mention on their phones and tablets. But since 2010, Cyber Monday actually has been the biggest online-shopping day of the year -- and retailers are trying to capitalize.

chatgpt: As shoppers across the globe gear up for the holiday season, retailers are pulling out all the stops to attract customers with Cyber Monday deals of up to 50%. Whether you're looking for the latest electronics or simply hoping to snag a bargain on everyday items, there's something for everyone as many websites now offer discounts throughout what they call "Cyber Week." The origins of Cyber Monday date back to 2005 when a retail lobbying group coined the term. The idea was to encourage people to shop online following Thanksgiving weekend as they returned to work and had easier access to the internet. Since then, Cyber Monday has become a massive shopping event in the United States, with many retailers offering exclusive discounts on everything from electronics to clothing. This year is no exception, with retailers vying for a piece of the $9.4 billion expected to be spent online during Cyber Monday alone. In a bid to attract shoppers, some retailers began offering their Cyber Monday deals as early as Thanksgiving Day, while others are extending discounts throughout the entire week.  For those looking for electronics, there are numerous deals to be found. Amazon has slashed prices on a variety of items, including the latest Apple iPad and the Samsung 65-inch QLED TV. Best Buy is also offering discounts on laptops and televisions, with some items up to 50% off their regular price. But it's not just electronics that are discounted during Cyber Monday. Retailers like Walmart, Target, and Macy's offer discounts on clothing, home goods, and numerous other items. Walmart's Cyber Monday sale includes up to 50% off in categories such as toys, home essentials, and beauty and personal care. Target is offering 30% off select clothing and accessories, while Macy's is giving shoppers an extra 20% off select sale items. As more people shift their shopping online in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, Cyber Monday has become an even more crucial event for retailers. While it remains to be seen if this year's Cyber Monday will surpass last year's record-breaking $9.4 billion in online sales, it's clear that retailers are leaving no stone unturned in their efforts to attract customers. One of the reasons Cyber Monday has become so popular is due to the convenience of online shopping. Instead of battling crowds and waiting in long lines, shoppers can browse and purchase items from the comfort of their own home. Many retailers also offer free shipping, making it even easier for customers to take advantage of the deals. While many retailers have been struggling due to the economic downturn caused by COVID-19, Cyber Monday may provide a much-needed boost. With millions of people expected to participate in the shopping event, it could represent a significant portion of retailers' holiday sales. In conclusion, Cyber Monday has become a highly-anticipated shopping event in the United States, with many retailers offering deals on electronics, clothing, and other goods. With discounts of up to 50% off and free shipping in some cases, it's no wonder shoppers are taking advantage of the convenience of online shopping. As retailers look to recover from the economic impact of COVID-19, Cyber Monday may provide a much-needed boost to their holiday sales.
