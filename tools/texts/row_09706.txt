article: Imagine if going through airport security was just a matter of walking past a stretch of wall. No pat-downs, no X-rays, no metal detectors, and no need to remove any clothing. The harsh reality of today's air travel is at strong odds with such a fantasy, but a new type of body scanner bears the promise to make every frequent traveler's dream come true. It's called "Alfa3" and it's based on the established technology of "millimeter wave imaging", which is used in hundreds of scanners currently deployed in airports the world over. But unlike those, Alfa3 does not require you to enter a chamber, raise your arms and stand still while the machine analyzes your body: it is able, instead, to do its job as you simply walk by. "It's a type of thermal imaging", explains Dr. Naomi Alexander, the Madrid-based physicist who invented the Alfa3, "so we see the difference in temperature between the body and objects that aren't part of the body." Current systems return a detailed image of the person being scanned -- passengers can in fact opt out and receive a pat-down instead -- but Alfa3 uses a passive technology that can detect objects underneath clothing without revealing any anatomical details. And compared to standard metal detectors, it has the ability to spot non-metallic objects as well, such as liquids and gels. One of the problems with current scanners using the same technology is the high rate of false positives, sometimes greater than 50 percent. The Alfa3 uses a significantly higher resolution that promises excellent accuracy and automatic detection of threats, according to its inventor. Further advantages include the possibility to deploy the system outdoors and in a covert manner, which would make it an interesting option for military installations: Dr. Alexander has traveled to Kandahar, Afghanistan, to test one of the four prototypes in existence at a NATO military base. But the main appeal of the scanner is surely its high throughput, over 400 people per hour. This could mean the end of security lines at the airport. The problem is to now make potential customers aware of the new technology: "It's not like selling sunglasses," says Dr. Alexander, "somebody already knows they want sunglasses, so they go and buy them, whereas with this system you have to explain the advantages with respect to what else is available on the market." "It takes some time to sort of educate, I guess, the customer in that respect. So, it's a process that needs to be gone through." Read more from Make, Create, Innovate: .

chatgpt: A new technology has hit the market and it has revolutionized the security industry. The Alfa3 scanner is changing the way security personnel screen people for suspicious objects. The scanner can detect non-metallic objects such as drugs, liquids, and other contraband without the need for the person being scanned to stop or even collaborate. This game-changing technology is a major step forward for the security industry. The Alfa3 scanner is a walk-through scanner that can detect suspicious objects on a person as they walk by. The scanner uses advanced imaging technology that is able to see through clothing to detect any objects on a person's body. What makes this technology unique is that it respects privacy by not showing any anatomical details. This means that the scanner can be used in public places without compromising people's privacy. The Alfa3 scanner is the first of its kind to be able to detect non-metallic objects. This is a major breakthrough for the security industry as many dangerous items are not made of metal. The scanner is able to detect drugs, liquids, and other non-metallic objects that are often used to smuggle contraband into public places. This makes the Alfa3 scanner a powerful tool in the fight against drugs and other dangerous substances. One of the most impressive features of the Alfa3 scanner is that it can scan people as they walk by. This means that there is no need for the person to stop or even collaborate in the screening process. This is a major improvement over traditional screening methods where people are required to stop and be searched. The Alfa3 scanner makes the screening process much more efficient and less intrusive. The Alfa3 scanner is also much faster than traditional screening methods. It can scan a person in a matter of seconds, whereas traditional screening methods can take several minutes. This means that security personnel can screen more people in less time, making public places safer and more secure. The Alfa3 scanner has been tested in a number of public places including airports, train stations, and public events. The results have been impressive, with the scanner detecting a number of dangerous items that would have otherwise gone undetected. The technology has been praised by security experts as a major step forward in the fight against terrorism and other threats to public safety. The Alfa3 scanner is a major breakthrough in the security industry. Its ability to detect non-metallic objects and scan people as they walk by makes it a powerful tool in the fight against dangerous substances and other threats to public safety. The scanner also respects privacy by not showing any anatomical details, making it a suitable tool for use in public places. As public places become safer, the Alfa3 scanner will play a key role in protecting the public from harm.
