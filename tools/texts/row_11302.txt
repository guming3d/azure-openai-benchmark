chatgpt: Legia Warsaw fans showed their displeasure towards UEFA during their match against Aktobe on Thursday night by unfurling a banner aimed at the governing body. The Polish outfit recently had their dreams of playing in the Champions League shattered after they were found guilty of fielding an ineligible player during their 6-1 aggregate victory over Celtic in the third qualifying round. Legia Warsaw had won the first leg 4-1 at home, but the player in question, Bartosz Bereszynski, was suspended and should not have played any part in the game. The Polish side were unaware of the suspension and played Bereszynski for the last few minutes of the match. They subsequently lost 2-0 in the second leg and were eliminated from Europe's elite club competition. UEFA's decision to expel Legia Warsaw did not go down well with the club or its supporters. The club's fans have been very vocal in their criticism of UEFA and they took their protest to the stands by unfurling a huge banner that read "UEFA mafia." The banner was greeted by chants from the home crowd, who were clearly unhappy with the governing body. Now, Legia Warsaw could be handed an explosive rematch against Celtic in the Europa League group stage. The Scottish champions were knocked out of the Champions League by Maribor and now find themselves in the draw for Europe's secondary competition. If the two sides are drawn together in the group stage, it would provide Legia Warsaw with an opportunity for revenge against Celtic. However, the two clubs would need to navigate their way through the group stage first. Regardless of whether they meet Celtic or not, Legia Warsaw have plenty of work to do in the Europa League. They will need to put the disappointment of their Champions League elimination behind them and focus on the task of trying to progress in Europe's second-tier competition. With their passionate support behind them, Legia Warsaw will be hoping to make a statement in the Europa League this season.
