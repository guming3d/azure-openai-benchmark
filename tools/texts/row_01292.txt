article: Kanye West and Kim Kardashian are accusing a YouTube co-founder of illegally publishing video of their engagement party to boost his new "foundering" website. A lawsuit filed Thursday by the celebrity couple blasts Chad Hurley, accusing him of secretly recording West's surprise proposal to Kardashian in the middle of San Francisco's AT&T Park on October 21. The video shows West kneeling near second base to ask Kardashian to marry him while a large orchestra plays in center field. The leak diminishes the value of the video of the event that Kardashian and West own, the suit said. Hurley "finagled entry" into the birthday party that West threw for his girlfriend, although only "several dozen people" were invited, the lawsuit said.  Although he tagged along with someone who was invited, he was permitted to stay "only after giving his word -- including in writing -- that he would not publish any aspect of the event."  The court filing includes a photo of Hurley purportedly holding the signed confidentiality agreement in his hand. "Immediately after giving his word to honor the condition required for his attendance at the event," Hurley posted the shaky video on MixBit, a video sharing website owned by his San Mateo, California, company, it said. The lawsuit slammed Hurley, 36, as a failed entrepreneur who leaked the video "out of desperation." "Despite his extraordinary financial success in creating YouTube, which was sold in 2006, Hurley has ever since sought his 'second act,'" the lawsuit said.  "This has become exceedingly elusive to Hurley." It cites his failed Formula One racing team and his "Web service named Zeen, which also failed and has been slated for closure in 2013." His newest venture -- MixBit -- "also quickly ran into trouble" after launching in August, the lawsuit contends.  "Following a lackluster launch and unsuccessful ensuing debut, Hurley sought to salvage MixBit from its dour beginning," the suit said. "An opportunity to do so appeared to Hurley when he learned of the October 21, 2013, event featuring West and Kardashian," it said. The video is titled "PLEEESE MARRY MEEE!!! Congrats Kim and Kanye!" It is still posted on the website, and the counter indicates it has been viewed 1.6 million times. Hurley knows better, the lawsuit said.  The terms of service on his own website warn users against posting any video that would violate copyrights, it said. "Undeterred by the contractual restrictions to which he had just agreed, Hurley opted to exploit and capitalize upon the extreme public interest he knew would attach to the event, in order to boost the fortunes or his underperforming business venture," the suit said. Hurley and his company did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment on the lawsuit.

chatgpt: A lawsuit has been filed against YouTube co-founder Chad Hurley for allegedly leaking a video of musician Kanye West's marriage proposal to reality TV star Kim Kardashian. According to the lawsuit, Hurley secretly recorded the proposal on his mobile phone and then posted it on his own video-sharing website, MixBit. The lawsuit, filed by West's production company, claims that Hurley violated a confidentiality agreement that prohibited him from sharing any information or footage of the event. The lawsuit also claims that Hurley "finagled entry" into the exclusive party where the proposal took place, despite not being invited. The video, which was recorded in October 2013 at San Francisco's AT&T Park, shows West kneeling to ask Kardashian to marry him. The lawsuit claims that Hurley's actions have caused substantial damage to the privacy rights of West, Kardashian and their family, and that the leak has cost them millions of dollars in lost revenue and damages. Hurley's alleged actions have been described as "out of desperation" by the lawsuit, which claims that he was struggling to keep up with the competition in the online video industry at the time. In response to the lawsuit, Hurley's legal team has argued that the confidentiality agreement signed by their client was not valid, as it was signed after the proposal had already taken place. They also argue that Hurley did not post the video on MixBit in order to compete with YouTube, but rather to share a "newsworthy event" with the public. However, West's legal team has argued that the leak was a deliberate attempt by Hurley to generate publicity for his own website, at the expense of their client's privacy rights. The lawsuit seeks damages of at least $20 million, as well as an injunction to prevent Hurley from ever sharing the video again. It also seeks to hold Hurley liable for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud and unjust enrichment. This is not the first time that West and Kardashian have had to deal with privacy violations. In 2016, Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint in Paris, with the thieves stealing millions of dollars worth of jewelry. The incident was widely covered by the media and sparked a debate about the excessive coverage of celebrities' personal lives. The lawsuit against Hurley highlights the ongoing struggles between celebrities and the media, and the lengths some will go to ensure their privacy is protected. It remains to be seen how the case will be resolved, and whether Hurley will be held liable for his alleged actions.
