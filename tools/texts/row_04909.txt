I have read the psychiatric reports and it appears very likely you suffer from Aspergers, which goes some way to explain your behaviour. However, an immediate custodial sentence is necessary due to the invasion of privacy and your abuse of trust.' Hoffman will also be put on the sex offenders register for 10 years.
