article: Guor Marial made his debut in the London Games on Sunday, a major accomplishment for the South Sudanese marathoner who ran as an independent in the Olympics. Marial, 28, pounded his way around the 26.2-mile course in 2:19:32. He finished 47th in the race dominated by fellow Africans Stephen  Kiprotich of Uganda, who won gold, and Kenyans Abel Kirui and Wilson Kiprotich, who won silver and bronze, respectively. But for Marial, completing the race was as good as winning. The marathoner was born in what is now South Sudan, which split  from Sudan last year after years of conflict between the two that left millions dead. Though he is a permanent resident of the United States,  where he fled 11 years ago to escape the bloody conflict, he is not an American citizen and thus cannot compete under its flag. He does not have a passport for South Sudan, either, and cannot compete for his homeland. And even if he had  one, the world's newest nation was not eligible for the Olympics this year because it does not have a Games committee. Since he qualified for the marathon but could not run for  both nations, the International Olympic Committee granted him permission to run as an independent. He donned a gray and black uniform with IOA --  Independent Olympic Athlete -- printed on it. "Even if I am not going to carry or wear the flag, I will be the flag of my nation. South Sudan will be in my heart," he said before the race. Marial left home in 1993. His story of survival from the war has taken him across different countries, including Egypt, where he sought refuge before the United States granted him asylum in 2001. He attended high school in New Hampshire, where he gave competitive running a try after years of "running away from conflict," he said. He later went to Iowa State University, where he had an athletic scholarship and was an All-American cross-country runner. The Olympian has not seen his parents since 1993, when he first fled what is now South Sudan. But on Sunday, they planned to catch a glimpse of their son on television after nearly two decades. "I'm hoping they will at least see me run in the Olympics," Marial said last month. "They live in a village with no electricity and no televisions. But they planned to walk to the nearest big town about 40 miles away so that they can watch me on television."

chatgpt: Guor Marial, a marathon runner who was born in what is now South Sudan, has made history by competing in the 2012 London Olympics under the Olympic flag. Marial, who does not have a passport due to the ongoing conflict in the region, refused to represent Sudan, his former home nation, or South Sudan, which did not yet have a recognized national team. Instead, Marial decided to compete under the Olympic flag as an independent athlete. This decision made him the first athlete to do so since the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, when athletes from Yugoslavia and the Unified Team competed under the Olympic flag due to political turmoil in their home countries. Marial's decision to compete as an independent athlete stems from his personal experience as a refugee. He fled Sudan at the age of eight after his parents were killed during the country's civil war. He eventually made his way to the United States and began running in high school. In an interview with CNN, Marial said, "Even if I am not going to carry or wear the flag, I will be the flag of my nation." His decision to compete under the Olympic flag highlights the power of sports to transcend political and nationalistic divides. Marial's determination and resilience in the face of adversity have made him a role model for refugee athletes around the world. He has used his platform to raise awareness of the challenges faced by refugees and to advocate for their rights and dignity. In 2016, Marial returned to the Olympics, this time representing South Sudan in the men's marathon. His participation was particularly significant given that South Sudan had only become a recognized nation in 2011, following a long and bloody struggle for independence. Marial's journey from refugee to Olympic athlete is a testament to the transformative power of sports. Despite facing numerous obstacles, he remained focused on his goal of representing his people and his nation on the global stage. His story inspires us all to persevere in the face of adversity and to fight for what we believe in â€“ even if it means blazing a trail of our own.
