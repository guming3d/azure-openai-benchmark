Scarratt is recognised after playing a key role in England's World Cup triumph in France last summer that saw her contribute 16 points in the final as Canada were dispatched 21-9, a haul that included a dazzling solo try. The 24-year-old from Lichfield, who can play outside centre or full-back, finished as the tournament's top points scorer with 70 and has amassed 55 caps since making her debut against the United States in 2008. Wilkinson won the The Special Award after retiring from rugby at the the end of the 2013-14 season . She becomes the second woman to win the award after England team-mate Maggie Alphonsi was honoured in 2010. Scarratt was joined on the four-strong shortlist by World Cup captain Katie McLean. Completing the quartet were Wilkinson and Ireland head coach Joe Schmidt, who steered the Irish to the 2014 RBS 6 Nations title and a clean sweep of autumn victories over South Africa, Georgia and Australia in his first full year in charge. The Special Award has been won by Wilkinson and O'Driscoll to mark the end of two outstanding playing careers after the British and Irish Lions duo chose the end of the 2013-14 season to retire. England's World Cup-winning fly-half Wilkinson and Ireland's all-time great O'Driscoll were named personality of the year in 2002 and 2009 respectively and now follow in the footsteps of Lawrence Dallaglio, the only other player to have won both awards.
