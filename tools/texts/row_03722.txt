article: (CNN) -- A North Korean official has questioned South Korea's credibility for its rhetoric and actions over the sinking of a South Korean warship in March, state-run media in North Korea reported Saturday. Maj. Gen. Pak Rim Su lashed out against the South for saying the North Koreans sank the Cheonan warship, a claim fiercely denied by his communist government. He said the evidence produced by South Korea to make its claim has been fabricated. He said South Korea has aggravated what has become a grave situation, and he warned that any accidental confrontation between the countries would result in war, according to an article in the state-run Korean Central News Agency. He cited North Korea's "nuclear deterrent" to deal with such situations. Pak spoke at a rare press conference from the country on Friday. He addressed Korean and foreign reporters and representatives of military attaches at foreign embassies and international organizations, the North Korean news agency reported. China, Japan and South Korea plan to discuss the warship's sinking this weekend. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao has that his country will not defend whoever is responsible for sinking the South Korean warship. He also said that China is not ready to accept South Korea's conclusion that the North is to blame. China meets with South Korea . South Korea says a North Korean mini-sub fired torpedoes at the Cheonan South Korean Navy ship, killing 46 people. Pak says South Korea cooked up the claim, and he called their investigations a farce. He said that the involvement of the United States shows that the probe couldn't be objective. Why are the two Koreas so hostile? Pak said people who disagreed with the investigators' assertions were expelled from the investigation team. He said the changes in investigation results as the case moved forward cast suspicion on the review, according to the state-run news agency's account. For example, the North Koreans say, the warship captain said at first there wasn't outside provocation but later said there was. And they say the military said at first there were no grounds to say it was an attack by the North but later changed that viewpoint. The North Koreans say the South is attempting to undermine efforts to promote reconciliation and North Korea's progress. They argue that the claim has served to rally conservative forces in South Korea and help them politically in upcoming elections.

chatgpt: North Korea has officially denied the claim that they are responsible for the torpedoing of a warship in South Korean waters. Pyongyang has instead accused South Korea of fabricating the evidence that was presented to the international community, triggering an international crisis that involved China, Japan, and South Korea. The accusation came shortly after the release of a report by a multinational investigation team that concluded that a North Korean torpedo caused the sinking of the South Korean warship, the Cheonan, in March. The incident killed 46 sailors, causing national outrage and distress. However, in a statement from the state-controlled Korean Central News Agency today, North Korea has dismissed the findings and vehemently denied any involvement in the attack. It claimed that the evidence was fabricated, and that the multinational investigation team chose to blindly accept South Korea's story while ignoring North Korea's repeated requests to participate in the investigation. Many analysts believe that these accusations may lead to further tension and a possible escalation of the already volatile situation. The international community, however, has responded promptly to the crisis. China, Japan, and South Korea held a high-level meeting on security matters yesterday to address the crisis. The three countries stressed the importance of ensuring peace and stability in the Korean peninsula and the region as a whole, and pledged to work together to address the situation. Meanwhile, South Korea has called for concrete action from the international community. The country's President, Lee Myung-bak, has called for a UN Security Council resolution condemning North Korea's actions, and has warned that any further provocations by North Korea will face severe consequences. The United States has also backed South Korea's call for action, with the White House reiterating its support for the South Korean government and its condemnation of North Korea's actions. President Obama has pledged to work closely with South Korea and the international community to "hold North Korea accountable." In conclusion, North Korea's denial of the torpedo attack on the South Korean warship has sparked an international crisis, with China, Japan, and South Korea calling for calm and cooperation to address the situation. The coming days will be crucial in determining how the international community deals with this latest challenge to regional security.
