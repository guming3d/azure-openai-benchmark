article: Mexico City (CNN) -- Protesters marched and packed the main square of Mexico City on Sunday, slamming the candidate widely seen as the front-runner in next month's presidential elections. Enrique Peña Nieto, the Institutional Revolutionary Party candidate, leads in polls. His party -- better known as the PRI -- ruled for some 70 years, before losing the presidency in 2000. Demonstrators say his winning would be a step back for democracy in Mexico. "I'm here because I'm really angry with what's going on in my country. I think it's not fair," said Adrian Garcia, 34, a protester. He wore a white T-shirt with the words "Yo Soy 132," ("I am 132") printed on it, referencing a nascent protest group that Peña Nieto inadvertently helped to create. After students jeered the candidate at a recent campaign event, Peña Nieto dismissed the demonstrators as outsiders, dragged there by political operatives to cause commotion. Three days later, a YouTube video featured 131 students flashing their university ID cards, saying "We are students from Ibero. ... Nobody forced us to do anything." The 11-minute video went viral. Posts promoting protests throughout the country on social media have used it as a jumping off point, using the phrase "#YoSoy132" on Twitter and Facebook. But Sunday's protests in Mexico City attracted more than just students -- teachers, unions and various political groups were also there. The demonstrations were timed to coincide with the last scheduled televised debate before the presidential election, which is set for July 1. Similar, though smaller, rallies were held in several other Mexican cities. Garcia, the protester, said he voted for leftist candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in the last election. Lopez Obrador never conceded after officials declared Felipe Calderon the winner of Mexico's election in 2006 and has been known to refer to himself as "the legitimate president of Mexico." The former Mexico City mayor is running again. "They are touching on a fundamental theme that has to do with the pretension of dominating the country through the almost absolute control of the media," Lopez Obrador said recently about the protesters. He and other opponents have accused Peña Nieto of receiving preferential treatment from the media since before the campaign began. The candidate, who was governor of the state of Mexico from 2005 to 2011, has denied those accusations and said he respects the youth protests against him.

chatgpt: With the presidential elections looming in just a month, anticipation is building across the country. This year's elections are particularly heated, with many candidates vying for the top spot. According to the latest polls, it appears that Enrique Peña Nieto of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) is in the lead. However, the campaign has faced criticism and protests from various groups. Protesters have flocked to the streets to voice their concerns and opposition to Nieto's candidacy. Many are unhappy with the coverage of the campaign by the media, which they claim is biased in favor of Nieto. This has led to accusations of media malpractice, with some protesters arguing that the coverage is blatantly biased, and that it is distorting the public's perception of the candidate's competence. Despite these allegations, Nieto continues to lead in the polls, which some attribute to his strong support base among rural voters, who have traditionally supported the PRI. However, others argue that there is a general sense of distrust and skepticism towards the political system and that the election results may not necessarily reflect the true will of the people. For his part, Nieto has dismissed the protests as the work of a small minority and has insisted that he has what it takes to lead the country. In a recent campaign rally, he called on supporters to help him "build a Mexico that works for everyone." He has emphasized his commitment to tackling corruption, improving infrastructure, and creating jobs, among other issues. Many have praised his message as a positive vision for the future of the country. Despite the apparent momentum in Nieto's campaign, there are still many questions surrounding the election process. Many are concerned about the potential for vote tampering or other forms of fraud, and some have called on the government to take measures to ensure that the elections are free and fair. With so much at stake, it is essential that the government remains transparent and accountable throughout the electoral process. In the weeks leading up to the elections, we can expect to see continued protests and rallies, as well as a flood of news coverage and analysis. Ultimately, however, it will be up to the people of Mexico to decide who they want to lead their country. The election results will have a significant impact on the future of Mexico and the wider region, making this one of the most critical events of the year.
