article: Samoa captain David Lemi claims the off-field controversy surrounding his players has galvanised the dressing room ahead of Saturday's match against England. The tourists had threatened to boycott the clash at Twickenham in protest against their treatment at the hands of the Samoa Rugby Union but it was confirmed this week that the strike had been called off. England will be desperate to end a miserable run of five consecutive defeats against the Samoans but Lemi insists the off-field row has been a help not a hindrance to his team's preparations. Samoa's David Lemi says his side have grown tighter in their preparation for Saturday after boycott threats . 'It has brought us together and given us more tightness in our preparation and focus for Saturday,' Lemi said. 'It's a massive opportunity for us - it has been a while since we played England so we are grateful to have this chance going into the World Cup. 'It is a good test for us - we play the tier two nations but to play against a top five side in the world is a test for us and will tell us where we are ahead of the World Cup.' Team manager Sami Leota insisted he was not aware of any plans for the players to stage a visual protest during the game. World Rugby (formerly known as the International Rugby Board) and the International Rugby Players' Association have been involved in discussions but the Samoa Rugby Union has so far refused to attend talks. Samoa threatened to boycott their match vs England due to a dispute over their pay with their Rugby Union . Leota also claimed to be unaware of a cancelled meeting between players and Union officials that was reportedly due to go ahead on Thursday morning. 'Any meeting that was meant to be held this morning - we are not able to answer about that,' Leota said. Samoa have made six changes to the starting XV that beat Canada 23-13 last Friday. Ken Pisi is selected at full-back, John Leota comes into inside centre and Tusiata Pisi starts at fly-half, while a new-look forward line includes Jack Lam, Kane Thompson and Ti'i Paulo.

chatgpt: England will take on Samoa in their autumn international fixture this Saturday. The match has faced several hurdles, including the threat of a boycott from the Samoan team over a pay dispute with their Rugby Union. However, both teams have confirmed that the match will take place as scheduled. Samoa's victory over Canada on November 14 showed that they are a formidable opponent. With their strength and pace, they will give England a tough challenge. In addition to their sporting prowess, the team has also demonstrated resilience and determination in the face of their recent pay dispute. The Samoan players put their pride and passion for their country above their own financial gain, showing their dedication to the sport and their people. On the other hand, England will be looking to bounce back after their disappointing defeat to New Zealand last weekend. Although the team showed some promising signs in attack, their defense was exposed by the All Blacks' slick attacking play. The England coaching staff will have been working hard this week to address these defensive frailties and improve their overall performance. England's head coach, Eddie Jones, has already warned his team about the threat that Samoa poses. Speaking to the media earlier this week, Jones praised Samoa for their physicality and their ability to play an unpredictable brand of rugby. Despite being ranked lower than England in the world rankings, Samoa has the potential to cause an upset. The match on Saturday will also be an opportunity for England's younger players to prove themselves on the international stage. With several key players absent due to injury, the likes of Joe Launchbury and Sam Underhill will be looking to make an impression and stake their claim for a regular starting spot. Overall, England vs Samoa promises to be an enthralling encounter, with both teams eager to come out on top. The Samoan team has already demonstrated their resilience and dedication to the sport, and will be looking to cause an upset against their more fancied opponents. England, on the other hand, will be determined to bounce back from their recent defeat and show that they are still a force to be reckoned with in international rugby.
