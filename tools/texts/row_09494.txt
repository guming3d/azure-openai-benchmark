Captured on camera: A childcare worker is facing a battery charge after being caught on CCTV allegedly kicking a 20-month-old boy in the face . Wrong move: Alexis J. Wilson-Britten, 22, a teacher at a former Kids R Kids day care center in Riverdale, Georgia, was arrested on Friday after the surveillance footage surfaced . Dismissed: The clip, which has now been made public, shows her apparently pushing pupil Jayden Reece away with her foot as he approaches her with a toy held in his hands . He appears to hold the object up to protect himself from the blow. Jayden is the son of fellow day care worker and teacher, Kimberly Johnson. She told CBS46 that she became concerned about the care being provided at the center after her other son, Ayden - Jayden's twin brother - came home from  on Thursday with a fractured arm. Ayden apparently injured himself in the playground but Wilson-Britten had not reported it to administrators. After Johnson informed the daycare center manager of  the teacher’s 'poor performance' her actions were reviewed. It was then that the 'kicking' incident came to light on surveillance video. Clayton County Georgia Police spokeswoman JaQuitta Williams told WSB-TV that Wilson-Britten performed the same action 'not once, but twice' although the released footage does not show the second strike. Facing charges: Wilson-Britten, who does not have a prior criminal record, was arrested Friday evening and later released Saturday . Robert Phelps, the owner of the daycare center, said Wilson-Britten was going to be fired the day she allegedly kicked Jayden. Her dismissal was linked to a prior case when she allegedly taped a pacifier to another toddler's mouth to stop her from crying. Police said Jayden wasn't injured in the incident, but they are investigating the injury to Ayden. Wilson-Britten, who does not have a prior criminal record, was arrested Friday evening and later released Saturday. The incident remains under investigation. A spokesperson who has rights to the Kids R Kids franchise said it terminated its agreement with the location in Riverdale more than a year ago and is not associated with the chain.

chatgpt: A former teacher at Kids R Kids in Riverdale, Georgia has been arrested after surveillance footage emerged allegedly showing her pushing a pupil with her foot. The incident is said to have occurred in the classroom when 22-year-old Alexis J. Wilson-Britten was approached by Jayden Reece, a pupil, who was holding a toy in his hands at the time. The footage shows Wilson-Britten pushing Reece away with her foot while he attempts to get closer to her. The incident reportedly took place in November last year and only came to light after the footage was reviewed by officials. The video, which has since gone viral on social media, has caused widespread concern and outrage among parents and students alike. Many have called for action to be taken against Wilson-Britten, including her immediate dismissal from the school. The school administration has released a statement condemning the actions of the former teacher and expressing their support for Jayden Reece and his family. The statement reads, "We are appalled by the actions of our former employee, and we fully support the Reece family during this difficult time. Our primary concern is always the safety and well-being of our students, and we will continue to take all necessary measures to ensure that they are protected from harm." Wilson-Britten has been charged with battery and cruelty to children in the first degree, and has since been released on bond. The incident has raised questions about the effectiveness of surveillance in schools and the need for increased vigilance to protect students from harm. Speaking to local media, Jayden Reece's mother expressed her shock and disgust at the incident. "I trusted that the teacher was doing her job and keeping my child safe," she said. "To see this on video is heartbreaking and I hope justice is served." The case has attracted widespread media attention and has sparked a conversation about the importance of teacher training and accountability. Many are calling for stricter regulations to be put in place to ensure that incidents like this do not happen again in the future. For now, the focus remains on Jayden Reece and his family, as they come to terms with this traumatic experience. The school has offered counseling services to all affected students and families, and has promised to work closely with law enforcement to ensure that justice is served.
