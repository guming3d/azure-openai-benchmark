Calum McEwan, 38, was knocked unconscious after he was smashed in the face by a Lothian Bus in Edinburgh . A man has been awarded £9,000 compensation after a bus wing mirror hit him in the face and left him looking like 'Frankenstein’s monster'. Calum McEwan, 38, was knocked unconscious when the vehicle smashed into him as he stood on the pavement in Edinburgh. He needed 18 stitches to his eye and head which split open. Mr McEwan, an estate worker at Heriot-Watt University, was awarded £9,000 in damages - despite Lothian Buses claiming their driver was not at fault. He said: 'I don’t know how the fast the bus was travelling but I felt lucky to be alive. 'I’d just popped out to get a few odds and ends from the shop. 'I was standing on the pavement and looked to my right to check the traffic and the bus mirror hit me immediately. 'I was knocked out cold and when I woke up there was a paramedic over me. 'The police closed off the road and an ambulance took me to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. 'The mirror hit me next to my eye. I hit the other side of my head on the pavement when I fell and cut that open too. 'At hospital I had an MRI scan then got 18 stitches to the cuts and was kept in overnight. I looked like Frankenstein’s monster the next day.' He originally lost his bid for compensation after a sheriff ruled that the collision in November 2010 was 'not reasonably foreseeable'. But appeal judges at the Court of Session found that the sheriff had 'erred in making findings of fact which have no proper foundation'. Compensation: Mr McEwan won £9,000 in damages after the incident which left him in hospital (stock image) Lord Eassie, Lady Clark and Lord Philip also ruled that pedestrians were 'entitled' to be 'not at risk' from passing vehicles. Mr McEwan, who lives in the city, said: 'I hope Lothian Buses learn a lesson and bring in training to avoid this happening again. 'People should be safe on the pavement. The next victim could be killed.' Personal injury lawyer Jennifer Murphy of Slater & Gordon, who represented Calum, added: 'If you are on the pavement you have the right to expect that you won’t be hit by a bus. 'So we are delighted that the original decision was overturned and our client has got a fair settlement for the injuries that he incurred.' Lothian Buses refused to comment.
