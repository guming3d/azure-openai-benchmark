article: A jab of gel may be a new way to treat heart failure, a condition that affects 900,000 people in Britain. The substance is injected into the heart wall to improve the organ’s function and reduce symptoms such as breathlessness and swelling in the ankles. Heart failure is a sign the heart has been damaged — this can occur for a number of reasons, including cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure and heart attack. Heart failure is a sign the heart has been damaged — this can occur for a number of reasons, including cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure and heart attack . As a result, the heart is no longer able to pump blood around the body properly. To try to increase its pumping power, the heart grows in size. This works for a while, but eventually the over-worked heart wall starts to stretch, becoming thinner and stiffer. The heart develops an abnormal shape and ends up pumping blood even less efficiently. The condition can also affect the heart’s normal electrical signals, which can result in a dangerous heart rhythm disorder. There’s no cure for heart failure, but lifestyle changes — such as cutting down on salt — and medication to reduce blood pressure can help keep symptoms under control. However, some patients do not respond to these. The hope is that the new gel injections will offer them an effective alternative. The treatment, called Algisyl-LVR, involves having 12 to 18 jabs administered directly into the heart’s main pumping chamber, the left ventricle, where the disease tends to start. The jabs are given by a surgeon through an incision in the chest. The injections contain a gel-like material that thickens in the heart muscle, strengthening it and restoring its shape. This increases the heart’s pumping efficiency and reduces stress on the organ, preventing further damage. The treatment, called Algisyl-LVR, involves having 12 to 18 jabs administered directly into the heart’s main pumping chamber, the left ventricle, where the disease tends to start . The gel doesn’t harden completely, remaining pliant so it is flexible enough to move with the tissue of the heart wall. It is being trialled on 80 patients in 14 centres worldwide, including in Italy, Germany, Romania, Australia and the Netherlands. Early results show the jabs improve the heart’s capacity and reduce symptoms. The U.S. manufacturer Lone-Star Heart says: ‘It represents a new treatment strategy based on the medically accepted principle that a reduction in muscle tension and cell stress will improve the function of the dilated left ventricle of the heart.’ Dr Christopher Morley, consultant cardiologist at Bradford teaching hospitals NHS Trust, says: ‘This ingenious technique of injecting a gel directly to the left ventricular muscle has a sound physiological basis. ‘Hopefully, it will prove to be effective and safe in patients who otherwise may have a poor prognosis.’

chatgpt: A groundbreaking treatment for heart failure is currently being trialled on 80 patients in 14 different centres around the world, including in Italy. The treatment involves having between 12 and 18 jabs administered directly into the heart. The injections contain a gel-like material that thickens in the heart muscle, strengthening it and reducing the risk of further heart failure. The procedure is carried out by a surgeon, who makes an incision in the chest and administers the injections directly into the heart muscle. The gel-like material then thickens, helping to strengthen and support the heart. This new treatment represents a significant breakthrough in the field of cardiology. Heart failure is a chronic condition that affects millions of people worldwide, with no known cure. This new treatment offers hope to those suffering from this debilitating condition, potentially providing a way to manage the symptoms and improve quality of life. The trial is being conducted on 80 patients in 14 centres worldwide, including in Italy. The participants are being closely monitored, with regular check-ups and follow-up appointments to assess the effectiveness of the treatment. Initial results from the trial have been very positive, with many patients reporting significant improvements in their symptoms and overall quality of life. Some have even been able to return to their normal daily activities and hobbies, which had previously been impossible due to their condition. The gel-like material used in the injections is made from a natural substance called alginate. This substance has been used for a variety of medical applications in the past, but this is the first time it has been used to treat heart failure. The treatment is still in the early stages of development, and much more research is needed before it can be widely adopted as a mainstream treatment for heart failure. However, the early results are very promising, and many experts in the field of cardiology believe that this new treatment could represent a major breakthrough in the fight against heart failure. There are currently no other treatments available for heart failure that are as effective as this new gel-based injection therapy. If the trial continues to show positive results, then this could represent a major step forward in the treatment of this difficult and debilitating condition. In conclusion, the new heart failure treatment that involves having 12 to 18 jabs administered directly into the heart is being trialled on 80 patients in 14 centres worldwide, including in Italy. The injections contain a gel-like material that thickens in the heart muscle, helping to strengthen and support the heart. Early results from the trial have been very promising, with many patients reporting significant improvements in their symptoms and overall quality of life. If the trial continues to show positive results, then this new treatment could represent a major breakthrough in the treatment of heart failure.
