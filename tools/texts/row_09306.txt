article: (CNN) -- Fernando Alonso won't be saving Euskaltel Euskadi after all. But Alonso still wants a cycling team and might start one up from "scratch." Formula One's highest-paid driver reached an initial agreement to buy Euskaltel Euskadi, Alonso's website stated early this month, but negotiations since broke down. If the Spanish outfit can't find another major sponsor soon, it won't be around for a 20th year. "The negotiations between Euskaltel and the representatives of Fernando Alonso for the acquisition of the cycling team Euskaltel Euskadi on behalf of the Asturian driver, which began with an agreement in principle on August 31, have ended without an agreement," the team said in a statement posted on its website. "For Euskaltel it is sad news that after the hope generated by the agreement in principle a definitive agreement has not been formalized to guarantee a professional future for the members of the team and to reward the fans that have been loyal until the last moment. "We would like to explain the details of the negotiations, because we have done our part, with total honesty, but it is not possible because we need to respect the confidentiality of the negotiations." Alonso, a cycling fan who hails from Spain, later took to Twitter to respond. "We've tried it until the end but it's just been impossible to have a cycling team in 2014," said Alonso. "My passion for the sport, my will to cooperate and do my bit remains intact, so this is only the beginning of the future. "From tomorrow morning we are going to work on building, if need be from scratch, a team we can be proud of. "It wasn't to be but it will be! This adventure has only just begun. Let's look forward to 2015!"

chatgpt: Two-time Formula One champion Fernando Alonso has decided not to purchase the Spanish cycling team Euskaltel Euskadi after negotiations ended. The decision leaves the Spanish outfit on the hunt for another major sponsor to keep afloat. Despite not sealing the purchase, Alonso expressed his desire to remain involved with a cycling team. He did not rule out starting a team from scratch and looked ahead to 2015. Alonso, an avid cyclist himself, had shown interest in purchasing Euskaltel Euskadi earlier this year. The team faced the possibility of folding due to a lack of funds after its main sponsor, an orange telecommunications company, pulled out of its deal. However, negotiations between Alonso's representatives and the team's management failed to result in a deal being made. "For different circumstances, it has not been possible to go ahead with the project. I really appreciate the work done and I hope that one day it will be possible for a project like this to come to fruition," Alonso said in a statement. The decision not to purchase Euskaltel Euskadi leaves the team in a difficult position. The potential collapse of the Basque-based team would be a blow to Spanish cycling. The team was founded in 1994 and has been a fixture in the cycling world since then. Euskaltel Euskadi has produced notable cyclists such as Samuel Sánchez, Mikel Landa and Igor Antón. Its future now hinges on the success of its search for a new major sponsor. Alonso, meanwhile, is expected to continue his involvement in cycling in some capacity. His statement suggested that owning a team was still on his radar. However, it remains to be seen what the future holds for the Spanish cycling team in the absence of a major sponsor.
