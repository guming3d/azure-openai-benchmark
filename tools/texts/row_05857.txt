article: Popeye's love of spinach is born out of one of history's easiest mathematical errors. A mathematician and scientist has revealed that spinach's iron content was miscalculated by a German chemist when he misplaced a decimal point. His mistake gave birth to Popeye's obsession with the vegetable, which the cartoon character eats in vast quantities to boost his strength. Popeye's testimony that he is 'strong to the finish, 'cause I eats my spinach' is apparently born from a mistake 50 years before he became popular. Erich von Wolf misplaced a decimal point when recording his research, making the iron content in spinach ten times more generous than in reality. This caused the popular misconception that spinach is exceptionally high in iron, which makes the body stronger...a myth that cartoon character Popeye (pictured) helped to spread . Samuel Arbesman talks about how scientific errors can lead to popular myths in his book, 'The Half-life of Facts: Why Everything We Know Has an Expiration Date'. In 1870, German chemist Erich von Wolf was researching the amount of iron in spinach and other green vegetables. When writing up his findings in a new notebook, he misplaced a decimal point, making the iron content in spinach ten times more generous than in reality. While Mr von Wolf actually found out that there are just 3.5 milligrams of iron in a 100g serving of spinach, the accepted number became 35 milligrams thanks to his mistake. This caused the popular misconception that spinach is exceptionally high in iron, which makes the body stronger. If the value was true, eating a generous serving of spinach would be comparable to munching on a small piece of paper clip. The story goes that cartoon creators aware of spinach's miraculous health properties had the idea that Popeye should eat spinach to increase his strength. It is believed that the cartoon character is responsible for boosting consumption of spinach in the US by a third. The incorrect . calculation of spinach's iron content contributed to the creation of popular cartoon character Popeye, according to a book by . mathematician and scientist Samuel Arbesman . While Mr von Wolf's error was spotted and corrected in 1937 when someone re-checked his maths, spinach is still popularly thought to be one of the most iron-rich vegetables, perhaps helped by the cartoon character. In 1981, the British Medical Journal published an article to try and debunk the spinach myth. Mr Arbesman uses the Popeye story to illustrate how humans have a tendency to ignore re-examining evidence and admit when we are wrong. He said that the reason such errors spread and lead to well-believed myths are because it is easier to spread a 'fact' that sounds correct than to delve deeper.

chatgpt: A new revelation has come to light regarding the nutritional value of one of the most popular vegetables in the world - spinach. It was discovered that the widely-held notion that spinach is high in iron was actually a result of a miscalculation made by a German chemist several decades ago. While spinach is, in fact, a relatively good source of iron, containing about 3.5 milligrams per 100g serving, it is nowhere near the levels that were previously believed. The roots of this misconception can be traced back to a decimal point mistake made by a German chemist in the mid-19th century. Instead of recording that spinach contained 3.5g of iron per 100g serving, he accidentally wrote down 35g. This error went unnoticed for decades and was eventually accepted into popular textbooks and other scientific references, leading to the belief that spinach was particularly high in iron. As a result of this mistake, spinach became a very popular food among people looking to boost their iron levels. The idea that eating spinach could make you stronger was even popularized in the 1930s by the comic strip character Popeye the Sailorman, who became famous for his Herculean strength after consuming cans of spinach. The image of Popeye flexing his muscles while chowing down on spinach has been ingrained in popular culture ever since, creating a widespread belief in the power of this little green vegetable. However, it turns out that the connection between spinach and iron was nothing more than a myth, perpetuated by an error that went unnoticed for decades. The discovery of this mistake was recently made by scientist Samuel Arbesman, who discussed the topic in his book, "The Half-Life of Facts." Arbesman points out that this type of error in scientific research is not uncommon, as mistakes can be made in data collection, analysis, and reporting. Despite the correction of this error, spinach remains a nutritious and healthy food that is good for the body. It is rich in a variety of vitamins and minerals, including vitamin K, vitamin A, and folate, making it an essential part of a balanced diet. So while it may not be the powerhouse of iron that many believed it to be, spinach is still a valuable and nutritious addition to any meal. The discovery that the iron content of spinach had been miscalculated for decades is a reminder of the importance of accurate data collection and analysis in scientific research. While mistakes like this can be embarrassing, they also provide an opportunity for scientists to learn and improve upon their methods. By remaining vigilant and diligent in their work, researchers can ensure that the information they provide is accurate and reliable. In conclusion, the widely-held belief that spinach is exceptionally high in iron has been debunked due to a miscalculation made by a German chemist in the 19th century. While this error may have led to a popular misconception, spinach remains a nutritious and healthy food that is good for the body. This discovery serves as a reminder of the importance of accurate data in scientific research, and the need for constant vigilance to avoid mistakes in reporting.
