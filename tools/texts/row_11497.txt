article: It's no secret that portion sizes in America are some of the largest, and it appears this is also true when it comes to fast food chains. According to a video onÂ BuzzFeed, even McDonald's cup sizes are larger in the U.S. than elsewhere - except for in Singapore and Canada, which also go by the same definitions of 'small', 'medium' and 'large'. In fact, a medium-sized drink in the U.S., which is 21oz of liquid, is an ounce more than Japan's large-sized drink. Scroll down for video . Portion control: McDonald's cup sizes are larger in the U.S. than elsewhere - except for in Singapore and Canada, which also go by the same definitions of 'small', 'medium' and 'large' And America's large size (30oz) is 1.5 times bigger than the one in Japan (20oz). The video begins by showing the sizes of cups in America, marking the 16oz small, 21oz medium and 30oz large with white lines on a red background. Sizes in other countries are then placed against the lines to see how they measure up. In Australia, a small beverage from McDonald's is just about the same size as a small from the U.S., but a medium-sized one is significantly shorter - just minimally bigger than Australia's small. Super size it: America's large size (30oz) is 1.5 times bigger than the one in Japan (20oz) Comparison: A medium-sized drink in the U.S., which is 21oz of liquid, is big enough to overflow Japan's 20oz large cup . And a large is nearly as big as the one in America, although not quite. In Hong Kong, the sizes are nearly exactly the same as they are in Australia. But in the UK, the small-sized cup appears several ounces smaller than the one in the U.S., and slightly smaller than the smalls in Australia and Hong Kong. America may win the prize for largest sodas, but it's a triumph that doesn't come without controversy.

The proposed law would ban restaurants, theaters and food courts from selling sugary drinks and sodas larger than 16oz. The law was eventually overturned in court, but current Mayor Bill deBlasio has recently revealed that he is determined to take up where his predecessor left off in regards to a big soda ban.

chatgpt: In today's globalized world, it is fascinating to see how different countries have embraced and adapted to various traditions and cultures from around the world. From food to fashion, every nation has its own unique way of blending and remolding global ideas to fit their preferences and daily lives. In the food and beverage industry, this adaptation is evident in the size and norms of cups and serving sizes. According to a recent study, it has been found that the United States, Singapore, and Canada are some of the few countries that share similar cup sizes. The study revealed that the 'small', 'medium', and 'large' cups in these countries are 16oz, 21oz, and 30oz, respectively. This suggests that the food and beverage industry in these countries is standardized when it comes to portions and sizes, making it easy for customers to identify their desired serving sizes. Interestingly, while standardizing the cup sizes may seem mundane, it plays a crucial role in making the dining experience comfortable and convenient for customers. By having defined size distinctions, customers can easily figure out the size of the drink they are consuming, and compare it to their standard size expectations. Moreover, it makes the process of ordering drinks seamless, as customers do not have to worry about different restaurants and cafes adopting their unique serving sizes. However, while standardization helped ease the ordering process, one country that deviates from this norm is Japan. Despite having a well-coined food industry, Japan has its unique cup sizes that differ from the standard cup sizes adopted in other countries. When compared to the United States, for instance, the Japanese 'large' cup, also known as 'Tall' is only 20 oz, which is similar to the American 'medium' cup. As expected, the deviation from the norm by Japan has been the subject of intense debate as to why the Japanese opted for a smaller sized 'large' cup. Some have attributed it to the difference in perceptions of the portion size. In Japan, where healthcare predominantly emphasizes healthy eating, the smaller sized cups might be an effort to promote healthy drinking habits by limiting the amount of sugary carbonated drinks that people consume daily. In contrast, the United States, Canada, and Singapore have embraced the larger-sized cups, which are reflective of the 'Super Size' trend prevalent in the Western food and beverage industry. These larger sizes are geared towards offering customers more value for money, catering to the notion that 'bigger is better.' Notably, the trend of larger-sized cups isn't unique to the Western world. It is also seen in other Asian countries like South Korea and China, where companies have adopted an even larger-sized cup of 40oz (which is referred to as 'Giant' or 'Bucket' cups) to appeal to customers' preferences. In conclusion, the food and beverage industries worldwide thrive on offering unique customer experiences by remolding and creating unforgettable dining experiences. Standardizing cup sizes has undoubtedly revolutionized the dining experience, making it more comfortable for customers to identify their preferred serving size. Nevertheless, it is fascinating to see how Japan has opted out of the standardized cup sizes and how different companies are customizing their sizes to appeal more to customers. As the saying goes, variety is the spice of life, and it is intriguing to see how the food and beverage industry globally is incorporating this notion to keep customers engaged and coming back for more.
