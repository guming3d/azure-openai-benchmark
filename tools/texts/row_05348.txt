article: (CNN) -- The International Criminal Court swore in Gambian lawyer Fatou Bensouda as its chief prosecutor Friday, the first woman to assume the top job at the world war crimes tribunal. She replaces Argentinian Luis Moreno-Ocampo, the inaugural prosecutor for the world court, whose nine-year term ends this month. Bensouda served as Moreno-Ocampo's deputy at the court based in The Hague, Netherlands. Member nations that recognize the court's jurisdiction voted for her unanimously during a December meeting at the United Nations. Her appointment comes amid fierce criticism against the court -- which has a heavy caseload of Africa investigations -- that it disburses justice selectively by focusing on the continent. The court currently has investigations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African Republic, Uganda, Kenya, Sudan, Ivory Coast and Libya. "Bensouda is taking over an established office with an already sizable caseload," Human Rights Watch said in a statement. "The office has opened investigations in seven countries and is conducting preliminary examinations to determine whether to open an investigation in at least seven other countries."

Critics have said the court targets Africa and bypasses opportunities to investigate abuses in various nations, including Afghanistan and Iraq. "Her election is a positive move by the International Criminal Court, " said Ayo Johnson, director of Viewpoint Africa. "The court needs an African in the role to justify why it is so heavily focused on African dictators . The court must be fair and should be seen as consistent in how it discharges justice, and not only focus on Africa. Prosecutor seeks new Congo war crimes warrants . Bensouda has worked in various other positions, including as adviser to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, which is trying key figures in the 1994 genocide. She has also served as justice minister and attorney general in her native Gambia. Supporters of the court applauded her appointment and said the court provides justice to victims of nations where the legal system is not efficient. "In Syria and other strife-torn countries over the past 10 years, the ICC has come to symbolize the last, best hope for justice," said Richard Dicker, international justice director at Human Rights Watch. "We look to Bensouda's leadership to advance cases, build bridges with victims, and push countries to support its impartial application of the law to get the job done." Bensouda, who will serve for nine years, was on this year's Time magazine list of 100 Most Influential People in the World. Can world court survive African Union's attack?

chatgpt: The International Criminal Court (ICC) has appointed a new chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, to replace Luis Moreno-Ocampo. She was voted in by member nations that recognize the court's jurisdiction in December. Bensouda will be the first African chief prosecutor in the ICC's history. Her appointment comes amid ongoing criticism that the court enforces justice selectively by focusing on African cases. This criticism has been a major barrier for the ICC's legitimacy, and thus, this new appointment aims at not only improving that, but also promoting the ideal of a more global court. Bensouda is known for her extensive experience as the ICC's deputy prosecutor, where she spent nine years helping to oversee cases such as those against Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir and former Ivorian President Laurent Gbagbo. She has often spoken about the need for the court to pursue greater accountability, regardless of the nationality or position of the accused. "I will continue to work tirelessly in the service of international justice," Bensouda said in her first public statement after the announcement of her appointment. "I believe that it is importantâ€¦ to strive for greater national, regional and international efforts for accountability."  The ICC was established to investigate and prosecute serious crimes, such as genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. As per the Rome Statute, which is the treaty that underpins the ICC, the court has jurisdiction over all countries that have ratified it, regardless of the nationality of the accused. However, several African nations have criticized the court, citing that it appears to target African cases more frequently. The ICC has been criticized for its lack of cases on other continents, and this is expected to change with Bensouda's appointment. Her extensive knowledge and expertise in international law, as well as her experience serving in the ICC, is expected to help bring more cases from other regions to the court's attention.  African Union, whose member states account for the majority of ICC cases, has been cautiously optimistic about Bensouda's appointment. The union praised her qualifications while urging her to be more independent in her handling of cases and avoid being influenced by external powers.  "She is qualified for the job and has worked in the ICC for so long. We hope that her leadership will lead to a more balanced and independent ICC," said William Blair, African Union Commissioner for Peace and Security. Bensouda's appointment comes at a crucial time for the ICC. The court is currently under pressure to increase its impact and relevance, and the selection of the first African chief prosecutor is seen as an important step towards this goal. With her appointment, the ICC is expected to become more accountable and impartial in enforcing justice worldwide.
