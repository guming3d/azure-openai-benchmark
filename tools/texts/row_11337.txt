article: Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Kenya marked the signing Friday of a new constitution expected to usher in major change, though the celebration swirled with controversy when Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, wanted for war crimes, joined the ranks of African leaders in attendance. Al-Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands, on allegations of war crimes and genocide in western Sudan's Darfur region, where violence that erupted in 2003 has left at least 300,000 people dead. Kenya, a signatory to the criminal court treaty, is obligated to hand over al-Bashir. "The Republic of Kenya has a clear obligation to cooperate with the court," said a document filed by the court prosecutor's office Friday, adding that the court was informing the U.N. Security Council of al-Bashir's presence in Kenya. Al-Bashir was invited to the celebrations in Nairobi by the Kenyan foreign ministry in his capacity "as the head of a friendly, neighboring country," said the spokesman for Prime Minister Raili Odinga. But the spokesman told CNN that he was "shocked" at al-Bashir's presence and that his attendance was "out of the blue." He also said that he had not spoken to Odinga but described the situation that developed as "impossible." Asked about Kenya's obligations to the international court to arrest al-Bashir, the spokesman said he did not think the Sudanese leader would be arrested on Kenyan soil. Human Rights Watch scolded Kenya for allowing al-Bashir to enter the country, saying that the wanted leader's presence would "forever tarnish the celebration of its long-awaited constitution." Pro-government militias known as the Janjaweed stand accused of ethnic cleansing in Sudan's Darfur region. Al-Bashir has denied that he helped armed the militias. Al-Bashir has traveled to several countries since the warrant was issued, including a recent trip to Chad. Friday he was among thousands of Kenyans at the signing of the new constitution three weeks after voters overwhelming approved the referendum. Debates over a new Kenyan constitution had spanned two decades, but intensified after postelection violence left more than 1,000 dead in 2008. "For the last two decades, the people have yearned for a new constitution," President Mwai Kibaki said. Kibaki signed six copies of the constitution and held one up as the crowd erupted in cheers during the signing event at a park in the capital, Nairobi. The signing was followed by the national anthem and a 21-gun salute. Changes to the constitution include a more decentralized political system that minimizes the president's powers. It also calls for land reform and allows dual citizenship -- a popular issue with Kenya's large diaspora community. CNN's David McKenzie contributed to this report.

chatgpt: On Friday, amid great fanfare, the Kenyan President, Uhuru Kenyatta, signed a new constitution that many believe is a significant step towards a more democratic Kenya. However, the celebratory mood was somewhat dampened by the arrival of another president; Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, who has defied an international arrest warrant and travelled to Kenya. The arrival of al-Bashir in Kenya has precipitated something of a diplomatic crisis, as Kenya is an International Criminal Court (ICC) signatory and therefore obligated to turn him in. Al-Bashir is wanted by the ICC for crimes including genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes committed during the conflict in Darfur. Despite this, the Kenyan government seems to have extended a warm welcome to al-Bashir, significantly increasing tensions with the international community. The African Union has publicly supported the Sudanese president, stating that the ICC should not be allowed to dictate African politics. However, the UN has described the actions of the Kenyan government as "disappointing", saying that it sends the message that those wanted for crimes against humanity can act with impunity. Human Rights Watch has also weighed in on the situation, calling for the immediate arrest and transfer of al-Bashir to the ICC. "By entertaining al-Bashir, Kenya is demonstrating a disregard for the ICC and the victims of the crimes for which he's wanted." said Elise Keppler, associate director of the International Justice Program at Human Rights Watch. The situation in Kenya is particularly sensitive due to the country's past experiences with political violence. The post-election violence in 2007-08 resulted in the deaths of approximately 1,200 people, and it is widely believed that both Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto were involved in the incitement of violence at that time. Both politicians were subsequently indicted by the ICC, although the charges against Kenyatta were dropped due to lack of evidence. While Kenyatta's signing of the new constitution has been broadly welcomed, many are concerned about the trajectory of Kenyan politics. Speaking to the BBC, analyst Aly-Khan Satchu said "There is a sense of deja vu in Kenya. We're seeing a government which is working actively against the international community, which is going to exacerbate the economic situation." Kenyatta himself has dismissed the concerns of the international community, stating that "Kenya is a sovereign nation and we will do what we think is right for the people of this country." The situation in Kenya is likely to continue to attract international attention, particularly with the ongoing conflict in South Sudan and the wider instability in the Horn of Africa. Many will be watching closely to see how the Kenyan government responds to pressure from the ICC, and whether it is able to balance these international obligations with its own domestic political concerns.
