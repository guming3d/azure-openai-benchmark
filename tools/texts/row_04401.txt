The result means Ronald Koeman's side leapfrog Louis van Gaal's in the Premier League as the Saints move up to third in the table. Robin van Persie was involved in a tetchy exchange with Phil Dowd over a drop-ball restart midway through the first half and responded by shoving the ball rather angrily into the referee’s midriff. Fortunately for the Dutchman, Dowd has a little extra padding in that department and no harm was done. However, the official had little hesitation in booking Van Persie for a challenge on Jose Fonte just before the hour mark.

This was Southampton’s first victory in the league at Old Trafford in 27 years – a 2-0 win here in January 1988.

chatgpt: In a stunning upset, Southampton managed to defeat Manchester United 1-0 at Old Trafford on Sunday, 11 January. The Saints' midfielder, Dusan Tadic, was the hero of the match, scoring the only goal and leading his team to a well-deserved victory. Despite Manchester United's best efforts, they were unable to break through Southampton's defense throughout the entire match. With both sides struggling to create any clear-cut chances, it was a moment of brilliance from Tadic in the 69th minute that proved to be the difference. The Serbian midfielder latched onto a brilliant through-ball from Steven Davis before expertly slotting the ball past the diving David de Gea in the United goal. The visiting fans erupted into celebrations as their team took the lead, and they continued to sing and dance throughout the rest of the match, their joy uncontainable. But it wasn't just Tadic who was instrumental in Southampton's win. Dutch winger Eljero Elia was handed his Premier League debut by manager Ronald Koeman and immediately made an impact with his pace and skill. He was a constant thorn in the side of the Manchester United defense and gave the home team's fullbacks a difficult afternoon. Meanwhile, Robin van Persie had a tetchy encounter with referee Phil Dowd, sparking controversy among both sets of fans. Van Persie felt that he was fouled by a Southampton player, and when the referee did not award the free-kick, the United striker made his feelings clear. Dowd responded by showing him a yellow card, much to the dismay of the Old Trafford faithful. Despite the setback, United tried to push forward and create chances, but were unable to break down Southampton's stubborn defense. Wayne Rooney had a few close calls, and even had the ball in the back of the net at one point, but the referee had already blown the whistle for a foul. As the final whistle blew, the Southampton players and fans celebrated their victory. The Saints have been in impressive form this season, and this win over one of the Premier League's biggest teams is a testament to their ability and fighting spirit. For Manchester United, it was a disappointing result, and one that will leave boss Louis van Gaal scratching his head. The Red Devils have struggled to find consistency this season, and this loss only adds to their growing list of problems. In conclusion, Southampton's 1-0 victory over Manchester United was a hard-fought and well-deserved win for the visiting team. Their defense was rock-solid, and Tadic's goal was the perfect example of the quality they possess going forward. As for United, they will need to regroup quickly if they hope to salvage their season and compete for a top-four finish.
