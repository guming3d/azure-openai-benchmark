article: He is a tireless green campaigner and quick to criticise anything which is harmful to the environment. But it seems millionaire Tory MP Zac Goldsmith is happy to let his own car burn a little extra fuel. For the environmentalist has been banned from driving and ordered to pay £570 after getting three speeding tickets in as many months last winter. Tory MP Zac Goldsmith, he son of the billionaire Sir James, has been banned from driving after clocking up three speeding offences . The 39-year-old was caught breaking the  limit in his hybrid Toyota Prius – the green driver’s car of choice – in the same location in Hammersmith, West London, on two consecutive days last December. According to prosecutors he was captured by a speed camera travelling at 38mph in the 30mph zone on December 4, then at 36mph on December 5. He was then caught speeding again in his own constituency of Richmond Park in South West London in February, driving at 39mph in a 30mph zone. As the son of billionaire banker Sir James Goldsmith already had points on his licence, he was last week fined and disqualified from driving for six months, after pleading guilty at Lavender Hill Magistrates’ Court. Goldsmith, who didn’t appear in court for the judgment, was originally scheduled to be sentenced yesterday but the date was brought forward for an undisclosed reason. Goldsmith was handed a £155 fine and a two month ban for his offence in Hammersmith Road, west London . In February, Goldsmith was flashed by a speed camera breaking the limit in Lower Mortlake Road in Richmond . Court official Nicola Kedney said: ‘Mr Goldsmith had three cases dealt with on July 23.  The first speeding offence heard was committed on February 20 this year in Richmond. He had exceeded 30mph on Lower Mortlake Road, a restricted road, while driving a Toyota. He got a £155 fine and was disqualified for two months. ‘For a speeding offence on December 5 last year on Hammersmith Road again he got another £155 fine and a two-month ban. ‘The third offence was for speeding the day before, December 4, on the same road. He was driving the same Toyota over 30mph in a restricted road. ‘He got a £155 fine, had to pay a £20 victim surcharge and was ordered to pay £85 prosecution costs. His licence was endorsed with three penalty points and he was disqualified for six months. The disqualifications will run concurrently, with the total ban lasting six months.’ Philip Goose, of road safety charity Brake, said: ‘Speed limits exist for one simple reason: they save lives. ‘Regardless of whether you are somebody with responsibility for deciding the laws on our roads or not, drivers should take personal responsibility for their actions and stick well within the limit.’ Yesterday, the housekeeper at Goldsmith’s home by the exclusive Richmond Park said he was on holiday in the countryside and wouldn’t be returning for a few days.

chatgpt: Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith has found himself in hot water after he was caught breaking the speed limit twice on the same road in south-west London, and then again in his own constituency. Goldsmith was reportedly flashed by speed cameras twice on the A4 in Hammersmith, before receiving another speeding ticket in Richmond, south-west London. The MP was taken off the road after he pleaded guilty to the offences, resulting in a six-month disqualification from driving and a fine of £570 in costs and fines. Goldsmith reportedly told the court that he had made a mistake and apologized for his actions. The incident has drawn criticism from road safety campaigners, who are concerned about the impact of speeding on road safety. They have called for tougher penalties for speeding drivers, and for better enforcement of speed limits. Goldsmith’s high-profile case highlights the issue of speeding on UK roads, and the damage it can do to road safety. According to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA), speeding is a major cause of road accidents in the UK, accounting for around one-third of all fatal accidents. RoSPA also notes that speeding can have a serious impact on the environment, contributing to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. The organization has called for stricter enforcement of speed limits, as well as efforts to promote safer driving habits and reduce the number of road accidents. The incident has also sparked debate about the role of MPs in promoting road safety. Some have argued that MPs should set an example by driving responsibly and obeying traffic laws. Others, however, have pointed out that MPs are no different from other motorists, and that they too can be prone to making mistakes behind the wheel. They argue that the focus should be on educating all drivers about the importance of safe driving, rather than singling out MPs for criticism. Despite the controversy surrounding his speeding offences, Goldsmith has remained a popular figure in his constituency, and has continued to speak out on a range of issues, including climate change and animal welfare. Goldsmith’s case serves as a reminder of the importance of driving responsibly and obeying traffic laws. It also highlights the need for tougher penalties for speeding drivers, and for better education and awareness campaigns to promote safer driving habits. Ultimately, it is up to all of us to do our part to make the roads safer for everyone, whether we are MPs or ordinary motorists. By driving responsibly and respecting speed limits, we can all play a role in reducing the number of accidents on our roads and protecting the environment for future generations.
