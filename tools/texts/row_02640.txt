chatgpt: Louis van Gaal era at Dutch football club, Ajax has started with a bang! The club tasted victory in their first friendly match against LA Galaxy with an extraordinary score of 7-0 in Carson, California. Now the Dutch club is preparing to face the Italian giants, AS Roma in their second pre-season friendly match at Dick's Sporting Goods Park in Colorado, and the game could see another familiar face take to the pitch, former Chelsea left-back, Ashley Cole. The match against Roma is a significant test for Ajax in this pre-season, with Roma finishing 7th in Serie A last season. Van Gaal is expected to use this match as an opportunity to assess his squad, and perhaps even test certain lineups that he may use in the upcoming season. The Dutch coach will be looking to build on the 7-0 result from the previous match and maintain the momentum. Ajax has been making headlines this summer with a few high profile transfers. The club has brought in accomplished players like Antony, the 21-year-old winger, who has been brought in as a replacement for Brazilian star David Neres. Another exciting addition to the squad is centre-back Lisandro Martinez, who has been signed from Argentine giants, Defensa y Justicia. The addition of these two players, coupled with the emergence of homegrown talents like Ryan Gravenberch and Jurrien Timber, ensures that Ajax has a mix of youth and experience within their squad. The likes of Dusan Tadic and Daley Blind, who have been integral to Ajax's success over the past few seasons, will provide the leadership needed for the club's young talents to flourish. However, Roma's lineup is nothing to scoff at either, with plenty of experienced players in their ranks like Pedro, who was signed from Chelsea last season. One player who will be making his return to American soil, despite the United States Men's National Team failing to qualify for the World Cup in 2018, is Ashley Cole. The former Chelsea left-back has been impressing in his new role at Roma, and his performance against Ajax could have a significant impact on the outcome of the match. Van Gaal has certainly set high expectations for his team, and the performance against LA Galaxy proved that the squad is capable of delivering on those expectations. Fans of this Dutch club are eagerly awaiting the match against Roma, where they will be looking to see their team continue their impressive run of form, and all eyes will be on Ashley Cole, who could make the difference for Roma.
