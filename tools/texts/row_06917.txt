Not struck off: Lorraine Bloice referred to her students as 'beasts' A teacher who called her pupils 'beasts' and referred to a child with special needs as 'a f****** little s***' will still be able to work as a teacher, an education panel has ruled. Lorraine Bloice, 32, was found guilty of inappropriate behaviour when teaching at a special needs school in Aberdeen, but will still be allowed to teach. Ms Bloice was heard saying 'don't wake the beast' when a child fell asleep in class and when asked if pupils had finished their morning snacks she said: 'Yes - let the beasts free'. The teacher and musician also referred to another pupil as 'a f****** little s***' when talking to a volunteer. A fitness-to-teach panel found some of the charges proven against Ms Bloice but ruled that she should not be barred from teaching. The General Teaching Council (GTC) for Scotland heard how the incidents came as Ms Bloice taught at a special school in Aberdeen. She told the hearing in Edinburgh that she used the word ‘beast’ after a reference to a pupil as ‘sleeping beauty’ from Beauty and the Beast. She said that was because of the child's pattern of challenging behaviour before lunchtime and her habit of falling asleep after lunch. She claimed that was a long-standing joke among members of the classroom team. Ms Bloice was also heard to call a pupil 'a boot’ during the same period in September 2011. Ms Bloice admitted she told a school volunteer about a pupil and said ‘I'd really like to write in his book that he has been a f****** little s*** today but I can't’. On another occasion Ms Bloice was . found to have ‘forcibly’ taken a pupil outside who struggled to keep up . with her - although the panel agreed that no suffering was caused. The . panel agreed that Ms Bloice ‘failed to maintain appropriate boundaries, . avoid improper contact. with pupils and respect her unique position of . trust as a teacher.’ Inappropriate: Ms Bloice had told a school volunteer that she wanted to write that a pupil at the special needs school was a 'f****** little s***' in his book (file photo) They also said her behaviour ‘had the potential to damage the confidence which the public have in her as a teacher as well as teaching as a profession’ and her banter was ‘inappropriate’ and ‘unprofessional’. But instead of removing her from the teaching register she will instead be forced to comply with strict conditions at her current school. A Conditional Registration Order and Reprimand will last for two years.

chatgpt: A teacher who referred to her students as "beasts" and called a pupil a "f****** little s***" has been allowed to keep her job. Lorraine Bloice, who teaches at a special needs school in Aberdeen, had faced being struck off but the Scottish General Teaching Council ruled that she will not face disciplinary action. Bloice was brought to the attention of the council after a volunteer at the school reported her for her conduct. The volunteer, who has not been named, said that Bloice made the derogatory comments about her students during a conversation at the school. The council heard that Bloice had referred to the students as "beasts" and complained about how difficult they were to work with. She also reportedly made negative comments about the behavior of one specific pupil, calling them a "f****** little s***." Despite the serious nature of the allegations, the council said that it did not have enough evidence to warrant striking Bloice off. It instead decided to give her a "reprimand" and ordered her to undergo "appropriate professional development." The decision has been met with criticism from some members of the teaching profession. One teacher, who did not wish to be named, told reporters that they were "disgusted" by the council's decision. "I can't believe that someone who refers to their own students as 'beasts' and calls a child a 'f****** little s***' is still allowed to teach," they said. "It sends the wrong message and undermines the professionalism of everyone else in the profession." However, others have defended the council's decision. Jane Cooper, a representative of the teaching union, said that it was important to take into account the context in which the comments were made. "While the language used by Ms. Bloice is clearly not acceptable, it is important to remember that she was under significant stress at the time," she said. "Teaching children with special needs can be incredibly challenging and it is not uncommon for teachers to struggle with the demands of the job." The debate around the case reflects wider concerns about the treatment of children with special needs in the education system. Teachers have reported increasing pressure to meet targets and produce results, which some say is leading to a neglect of their students' individual needs. As for Bloice, it remains to be seen whether or not the reprimand and professional development will be enough to improve her conduct. But for now, she will be allowed to return to the classroom and continue teaching her "beasts."
