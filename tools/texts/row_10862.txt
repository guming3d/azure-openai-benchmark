article: (CNN) -- A French prosecutor investigating a ski accident in which former world champion racing driver Michael Schumacher was seriously injured said Wednesday that speed was not an important factor. Schumacher has been in a medically induced coma for the past 10 days and has undergone two surgeries since the December 29 accident. His doctors say he is in stable but critical condition. Prosecutor Patrick Quincy, speaking at a news conference in Albertville, said the investigation had made progress but could still take several weeks to complete. "Speed is not a particularly important element for us in that inquiry," he said. Police investigator Stephane Bozon said it was not possible to estimate Schumacher's speed in terms of kilometers per hour, "but this was the speed of a very good skier on a slope which was not very steep." Another investigator, Benoit Vinneman, said Schumacher was traveling at "a normal speed for an experienced skier." Quincy ruled out problems with Schumacher's skis, which he said were almost new. The piste, or ski run, also appeared to be correctly marked according to French standards, he said. Family ask media for privacy . Schumacher hit a rock hidden beneath the snow while skiing in an area between two marked pistes, the prosecutor said, which catapulted him face first onto another rock. Schumacher ended up 9 meters (30 feet) from the edge of the piste, he said. Investigators have begun studying footage filmed on a small camera attached to Schumacher's helmet, but further analysis is needed, Quincy said. The video is only two minutes long and has a very limited field of vision, he said. He said experts may be able to use it to determine Schumacher's precise position in relation to the edge of the piste and possibly the speed at which he was traveling at the time of the accident. Why induced comas help injured brains . Investigators are talking to family members, witnesses and others in connection with the Schumacher inquiry, he said. The investigation is no different from those carried out in other serious accidents on the slopes, Quincy added. There are about 50 such a year in the Albertville area, he said. Schumacher is a formidable figure in Formula One, and his plight has attracted global interest and an outpouring of support from the sport's fans. However, his family wants the media to keep its distance and appealed Tuesday for privacy. "Please support us in our common fight with Michael," Corinna Schumacher, the wife of the race car driver, said in a statement. "It is important to me that you (media) relieve the doctors and the hospital so that they can work in peace. I kindly ask you to trust their statements and leave the clinic. Please also let our family in peace." Schumacher is the most successful driver in Formula One history, driving for the Benetton and Ferrari teams and claiming a record seven world titles and 91 grand prix wins.

chatgpt: Former Formula One champion Michael Schumacher was traveling at "a normal speed for an experienced skier" when he had a skiing accident which left him in a medically-induced coma, according to investigators. The lead prosecutor Patrick Quincy revealed this finding stating that "speed is not a particularly important element" in the investigation into the accident.  Schumacher was skiing off-piste when he fell and hit his head on a rock in the French Alps resort of Meribel in December 2013. Despite wearing a helmet, the impact left him with a severe brain injury. The investigation into the accident has been ongoing and recently the prosecutor provided an update about the progress.  Investigators have been examining every aspect of the incident, including the condition of Schumacher's skis. Quincy stated that Schumacher's skis were not faulty, and therefore could not have contributed to the accident.  Additionally, investigators have been studying footage captured by a camera mounted on Schumacher's helmet at the time of the accident. This footage may provide crucial information about the circumstances leading up to the incident.  The prosecutor also commented that the inquiry is complex due to the various factors that could have contributed to the incident. Quincy stated that "the investigation has not yet been completed, but we are moving forward, and we still need to do some work on the infrastructures on this ski run."  The investigation has reportedly been complicated due to the fact that Schumacher was skiing off-piste, which means that he was skiing on unmarked territory that was not within the confines of the resort's official ski runs. Quincy stated that "it's difficult to reconstruct exactly what happened" as they have to rely on eyewitness accounts and other forms of evidence to understand the situation before the incident.  Schumacher's family has been updating the public on his condition since the accident, however, they have maintained privacy and requested that the media respect their privacy. Schumacher was first treated in Grenoble Hospital in France and then transferred to a Swiss hospital where he is currently being cared for.  Schumacher's accident has raised questions about the safety measures surrounding skiing, especially off-piste skiing. The prosecutor agreed that such accidents are a cause for concern and stated that "safety measures must be increased" to prevent similar accidents from happening in the future.  In conclusion, while the investigation into Michael Schumacher's skiing accident is ongoing, the latest update from the lead prosecutor suggests that the speed at which he was skiing was not a significant contributing factor. Additionally, his skis were not found to be faulty, and investigators are now focusing on footage from his helmet camera as they piece together the events leading up to the incident. The investigation is still ongoing, and the prosecutor emphasized that safety measures must be improved to prevent similar accidents from happening in the future.
