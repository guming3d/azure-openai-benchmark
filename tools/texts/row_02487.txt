article: (CNN) -- Suzanne Forman enters a swanky Los Angeles restaurant with Todd Grodnick, a blind date she's only spoken to on the phone. The two are among a growing number of baby boomers who are going online to date. "I mean I can't believe I'm 55," Forman said. "I feel like I'm still 20 or 30 or something. I still have the energy. I still have that spark. But I do have a lot of candles on my cake." A study conducted for OurTime.com, a dating site catering to baby boomers, found unmarried people over 50 consider companionship more important now than they did during their 20s. But it's often difficult to find a good match through traditional connections such as friends and relatives. "I was a vegetarian and one of the guys they set me up with took me to a Moroccan restaurant, and he ate raw meat in front of me, right next to me!" Forman recalled. So Forman joined OurTime, which she said offers a "candy store of people." "There has been a perfect storm ... of baby boomers who are single, with a growing number ... using the Internet and discovering that it's a way to be connected," said Dr. Gail Saltz, OurTime's relationship expert. Another customer is Staci Dansey, a 61-year-old Newport Beach, California, real estate agent. "It's like my business, it's a numbers game. The more people I meet, the greater the odds that I will meet a guy who wants to have a loving, warm, serious, committed, monogamous relationship." After her marriage ended, Dansey said her daughter and daughter-in-law suggested online dating, but she said she was reluctant because she had heard "horror stories." But dating sites say they offer much better protection against stalkers, scam artists and worse, because they collect background information on clients. A 2010 survey by eHarmony.com found the Internet is the most popular way for people over 50 to meet and marry. "I've always thought the idea that the older generation is afraid of technology is overblown, because they now seem to adopt it, and adopt it in numbers just as much as everybody else does," said eHarmony's Dr. Gian Gionzaga. Vange LeClerc, a widow, and Rob Foss, a divorcÃ©, met through eHarmony in 2008. "I had been married so long I had kind of forgotten the process," Foss said. "I was like a duck out of water." LeClerc conceded online dating was "scary," but she said she found the process "less intimidating than going out and meeting someone at a bar." Now the baby boom couple plan to make their online match permanent, with a Hawaiian wedding next year.

chatgpt: As the dating scene continues to evolve, singles over 50 are finding new ways to connect with one another. One popular platform among this age group is OurTime.com, a dating site tailored specifically to those over 50. However, not everyone is convinced that these sites offer a safe and successful way to find love. One woman, who asked not to be named, describes OurTime.com as a "candy store of people." After being newly single in her 60s, she turned to the online dating world to meet new people. Although she has had some success, she says it can be overwhelming to have so many options at her fingertips. "I never expected to have this many choices," she says. "It's like walking into a candy store and having every flavor available to you. It's exciting, but also a little daunting." Like many others, the woman had heard horror stories about online dating scams and predators. This made her hesitant to sign up in the first place. However, she ultimately decided to go for it after learning that the site provides background information on all of its clients. "I felt more comfortable knowing that they do their homework and weed out the bad apples," she says. Other sites catering to this age group, such as Silver Singles and Senior Match, also claim to have strict safety measures in place. They screen all new members and monitor activity to ensure that everyone is playing by the rules. Real estate agent Susan Jameson says she was also wary of online dating after hearing negative stories from friends. However, she decided to give it a try after being single for several years. "I was hesitant at first, but then I thought, 'Why not?'" she says. "It's not easy to meet people at my age, and I felt like I had nothing to lose." Jameson says that one of the biggest benefits of online dating is the ability to be upfront about what you're looking for. On sites like OurTime.com, users can specify their age range and other preferences to ensure that they're matched with like-minded individuals. "It takes away the guesswork and saves a lot of time," she says. According to a 2019 survey by Pew Research Center, online dating has become increasingly popular among older adults. The survey found that 12% of American adults ages 55 to 64 had used an online dating site or app, while 6% of those 65 and older had done so. While online dating may not be for everyone, these sites are providing a valuable service to those looking for love later in life. With safety measures in place and a wide range of options to choose from, it's no wonder that more and more singles over 50 are turning to the internet to find their perfect match.
