article: The Premier League proved itself to be the richest league in the world as figures released show how the £1.5 billion of prize money was shared out - with bottom club Cardiff earning over £62million and Liverpool earning more than champions Manchester City. The Merseyside giants earned £97,544,336 from Premier League funds for their 2013-14 campaign, pushing champions Manchester City into second place. City earned £96,578,329. Liverpool earned more than City because 28 of their 38 league games were screened live on TV as opposed to only 25 of City’s and TV appearances are one factor considered. The top five earners were completed by Chelsea (£94.1m), Arsenal (£92.9m) and Tottenham (£89.7m). Last season’s champions and top earners Manchester United were seventh in this season’s Premier League but sixth highest earners with £89.2m. Top of the table: Manchester City's captain Vincent Kompany lifts the Premier League trophy . How the money was divided: Official Premier League payments . At the other end of the table, bottom placed Cardiff City earned £62,082,302 for a campaign in which they ended up relegated to the Championship. Astonishingly this was £1.2m MORE than United pocketed in 2012-13 for winning the title - with the huge increases this season a result of the lucrative new TV deals now in place. Sky and BT Sport are paying £3.018 billion between them to show Premier League matches live in the UK across three seasons from 2013 to 2016 inclusive. Foreign broadcasters around world are paying another £2.3 billion combined, on top, for the same period. TV turn on: Luis Suarez and Liverpool were the side who were featured most on television . The Premier League also earns money from the sales of highlights (on Match of the Day) and near-live rights (on Sky) and brings in further sums from commercial deals like the one with headline sponsor Barclays. All that cash goes into one big pot and the sums announced today are the hard eye-watering rewards for the clubs. Every club gets an ‘equal’ share of £52,198,111, which derives from domestic TV income (£21,631,444 per club), overseas income (£26,295,817) and commercial income (£4,270,850). Every club then gets another sum depending on league position, worth £1,236,083 per place in the table, from that sum for bottom-placed Cardiff to £24,721,600 to winners City. Bottom of the list: Stoke's games were broadcast the least in the Premier League . Fall from grace: Manchester United went from Champions last season to seventh this . Each club also gets a variable amount depending on how many times they were shown live on Sky or BT this season. Every club got a minimum of £8.6m from this pot, even if they were shown as rarely as Stoke (just seven live televised games). Liverpool, shown 28 times, got £21.9m in these ‘facility fees’. This season’s rewards are a huge leap on last season’s TV income, with Liverpool earning £42.7m more than season than last, for example.

chatgpt: In a stunning turn of events, Liverpool has earned more prize money than the Premier League champions, Manchester City. Despite lifting the trophy, Manchester City earned slightly less than Liverpool thanks to the Premier League's payment formula. Coming in third for prize money earned was Chelsea, while Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal finished off the top five. However, the most shocking revelation was that the bottom club, Cardiff, earned a whopping £62million, which is even more than former champions Manchester United won in the 2012-13 season. But how is it possible that Cardiff earned more than a club with such a rich football history? The answer lies in the TV rights deal that the Premier League has with Sky and BT Sport, worth a staggering £3billion over three years. The payment formula for prize money distribution is based on a combination of factors, including a proportion of TV rights revenue. And with 28 Liverpool games shown live during the season, the club was able to earn a significant amount from TV rights revenue. This highlights the immense power of TV rights in modern football, and how clubs with a large fan base and a high number of televised games can earn significantly more than those with less exposure. In fact, Stoke City were only shown live on TV seven times in the season, highlighting the huge disadvantage that smaller clubs face in the Premier League. However, it's not just the clubs that benefit from the TV rights deal. The Premier League is one of the most watched competitions in the world, attracting millions of viewers from around the globe. The high levels of exposure and financial rewards have enabled Premier League clubs to attract some of the world's best players and coaches, making it one of the most lucrative and competitive leagues in the world. Despite the challenges faced by smaller clubs, it is clear that the Premier League's TV rights deal has brought immense financial rewards to the league and its clubs. The high levels of exposure and international appeal have made it one of the most watched and profitable competitions in the world, with substantial benefits for all involved. Looking ahead to the future of football, it is clear that TV rights deals will continue to play a crucial role in the financial success of clubs and leagues. As technology and streaming platforms continue to advance, the potential for even greater levels of exposure and financial rewards for clubs will only increase. For now, Liverpool can celebrate their financial success, as well as their impressive performance on the pitch. However, with the Premier League becoming even more competitive and unpredictable each season, it remains to be seen which club will earn the most prize money and accolades in the years to come.
