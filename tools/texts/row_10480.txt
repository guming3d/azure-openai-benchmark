article: Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan officially declared Saturday that he will run in the 2011 elections, lauding his achievements in reforming the oil, banking and electricity sectors. "I have decided to humbly offer myself as a candidate in the presidential primaries of our party the great PDP (People's Democratic Party)," he said. Jonathan's official declaration comes three days after he informally announced on Facebook that he intended to run in the primaries, which will be held between October 18 and 20, according PDP spokesman Rufai Alkali. "In presenting myself for service, I make no pretense that I have a magic wand that will solve all of Nigeria's problems or that I am the most intelligent Nigerian," Jonathan wrote on his Facebook page Wednesday. He took a more confident stance Saturday, announcing that under his presidency, all petrol refineries are now working, the banking sector has been reformed, electricity has been stablized and steps have been taken to fix roads, water, education and food production. He also said he has set in progress free and fair elections. Jonathan's eligibility was in question until last month, when the People's Democratic Party said he could run in an open race with other candidates next year. Under Nigerian "zoning" rules, power must shift to different regions and ethnic groups every eight years. Jonathan -- who is from the Niger Delta, in the south -- was part of the joint ticket of the late President Umaru Yar'Adua, who was from the north. Yar'Adua's death in May, after a long illness, upset the order of the zoning. Yar'Adua was elected in 2007 and his southern replacement threatened to halt the north's turn at holding power. On Friday, four main contenders from the north announced they will put forth a single candidate to challenge Jonathan. CNN's Christian Purefoy contributed to this report.

chatgpt: President Goodluck Jonathan has announced his intention to run in next month's primaries, seeking a second term in office. Jonathan has been in power since 2010, when he took over from Umaru Yar'Adua, who died in office. As the campaign for the primaries intensifies, the president has praised the achievements made under his leadership, highlighting the improvements in the Nigerian economy and the country's infrastructure. Despite Jonathan's declaration to run, a bloc of politicians from the country's north have planned to challenge him. The group, known as the Northern Elders Council, has been critical of Jonathan's performance in office, particularly in his handling of the Boko Haram insurgency in the north. The group has accused Jonathan of incompetence and has called for a new leader to take over the country. The challenge from the Northern Elders Council poses a significant threat to Jonathan's chances of securing the nomination. The north has traditionally been a stronghold for the opposition, and the group could potentially sway the vote in their favor. However, Jonathan remains confident of his chances and has promised to continue working towards the development of the country. Jonathan's campaign has been fueled by his record of achievements during his time in office. The president has overseen the expansion of Nigeria's economy, with the country now being considered one of the fastest-growing economies in Africa. He has also made significant investments in infrastructure, particularly in the area of power generation and transportation. Despite these accomplishments, Jonathan's tenure has also been marked by controversy, particularly in his handling of the Boko Haram insurgency. The terror group has been responsible for a series of attacks in the north, targeting civilians and government institutions. Jonathan's response to the crisis has been criticized for being slow and ineffective. As the campaign for the primaries heats up, many Nigerians will be closely watching the developments, hoping for a peaceful and fair election. Whoever emerges as the nominee will face an uphill battle in the general election, with the country grappling with a host of challenges, including poverty, corruption and insecurity. For now, President Jonathan remains focused on his bid for re-election, hoping to secure another term to continue his efforts towards building a better Nigeria.
