article: Former Republic of Ireland winger Damien Duff is poised to move to Australia and become the first major signing for the club bought by Manchester City’s owners. The 35-year-old, who announced his decision to quit relegated Fulham this week, will join the A-League after the World Cup Finals. He will become the first major signing for the newly-formed Melbourne City, who are hoping to change their name from Melbourne Heart in time for next season. City’s Abu Dhabi-based owners, who have also purchased sides in New York and Japan since acquiring Manchester City six years ago, are hoping to build a competitive side Down Under. Heart are currently bottom of the A-League. Heading Down Under: Damien Duff has signed for Australian A-League club Melbourne City on a one-year deal . Duff, capped 100 times by Ireland, had been linked with a return to his home country and a role with Bray Wanderers in the SSE Airtricity League. But he has turned his back on a potential return to the Premier League or any moves to clubs in Europe, or even a drop to the Championship with Fulham, to move Down Under. Duff will take a summer break with his family before moving to Melbourne for the second part of their season. He has had his pick of A-League sides, including Heart’s city rivals Melbourne Victory, Sydney FC and Perth Glory. City’s backers are prepared to match Duff’s wage demands. His decision to quit Europe for a lucrative move to Australia will still come as a surprise, even though he made just 11 league appearances last season. New chapter: The 35-year-old brought an end to his five-year spell at Fulham and will head to the A-League . Former Chelsea and Newcastle midfielder Duff left Craven Cottage after five years and nearly 200 games, following their relegation from the Premier League, and was looking for a new challenge.‘It was time for everyone, for me and the club to part ways,’ he said. ‘It’s sad but that’s the way it is.‘I’ve matured as a person and a player at Fulham. ‘Since I’ve been here I’ve got married, had two kids, so it has been a special time in my life and I stand by what I’ve said before that my most enjoyable time in football has been at Fulham.’ But Duff, who is signing an initial two-year deal, will be by far the biggest foreign star Melbourne has attracted since the A-League was founded 10 years ago. Former Liverpool midfielder Harry Kewell is currently playing for the club, who are managed by Dutch coach John van’t Schip.
