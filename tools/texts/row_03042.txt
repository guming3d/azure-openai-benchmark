article: A 22-year-old Dutch woman's ear turned black after she was bitten by a Mediterranean recluse spider in Italy . A Dutch woman’s ear turned black after she was bitten by a poisonous spider in Italy. Part of the 22-year-old’s ear was liquefied by the Mediterranean recluse spider’s venom and the skin and cartilage died. The woman’s experience is thought to be the first evidence that recluse spider venom can destroy cartilage. The patient’s health problems began when she woke up with a painful ear one morning, LiveScience reports. Her ear swelled up so, unaware she had been bitten by a spider, she visited a local hospital where she was given antihistamine. Despite this treatment, the swelling and pain failed to subside. By the time she returned to the Netherlands, part of her ear had turned back indicating the cells had died. The woman sought medical help and doctors realised she had been bitten by a Mediterranean recluse spider as the creature’s venom is known to kill skin. However, Dr Marieke van Wijk, a plastic surgeon involved in the patient’s care, explained this was the first time doctors had seen the spiders’ venom destroy cartilage as well as skin. The spiders’ venom kills cells using a complex mixture of chemicals which break down proteins and there is no drug treatment that is known to be effective. As a result, Dr van Wijk and her colleagues were forced to remove the dead tissue from the woman’s ear and then rebuild it using cartilage from her ribs. The Mediterranean recluse spider originated in the Mediterranean region of North Africa and Europe but it is now widely distributed. It has poisonous venom but is thought only to bite when forced into contact with people - for example, if trapped in clothes or bedding. In rare cases, the spiders’ bites can be fatal as they can cause kidney failure. The spider's venom liquefied part of the woman's ear and caused some of the skin and cartilage to die. The dead tissue had to be cut away (left) and then the ear had to be rebuilt using cartilage from her ribs (right) Normally, bites cause a red patch to develop on the skin which leaves a slow-healing, open wound and exposed muscle. It can take up to two months for the wound to heal and it often leaves a sunken scar. Dr van Wijk told LiveScience that the spiders are ‘not that dangerous’ and that she ‘wouldn’t take precautions’ to avoid a bite. The case was reported in the Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery.

chatgpt: In a shocking incident, a 22-year-old Dutch woman was bitten by a Mediterranean recluse spider while on vacation in Italy. What followed were horrific consequences, as the venom from the spider not only liquefied part of her ear but also destroyed her skin and cartilage. This is the first known case of a spider's venom having the power to destroy cartilage in humans. According to reports, the young woman had been enjoying a peaceful vacation in Italy when she suddenly began to experience excruciating pain in her ear. She went to a hospital in the region where she was diagnosed with a spider bite. Tests later confirmed that it was indeed the Mediterranean recluse spider that had bitten her. The venom from the spider, known to be extremely toxic, had devastating effects on the woman's ear. It caused tissue to liquefy and destroyed both the skin and cartilage in the affected area. Doctors were forced to remove the dead tissue and rebuild her ear from scratch. The woman's ordeal highlights the dangers of venomous spiders, particularly those found in Mediterranean countries. Although these spiders are relatively rare, their venom can have serious and potentially fatal consequences. In this case, it was fortunate that the woman sought medical help quickly, as delaying treatment could have resulted in even more serious injuries. Despite this incident, experts have urged people not to panic or avoid traveling to Mediterranean countries altogether. Rather, they emphasize the importance of taking precautionary measures, such as wearing protective clothing and using insect repellent in areas where spiders are known to thrive. It is also important for healthcare professionals to be aware of the potential risks associated with spider bites and to recognize the symptoms of venom poisoning. While cases like this are rare, they can have severe and long-lasting effects on those who are affected. The Dutch woman's experience serves as a reminder of the dangers of venomous spiders and the importance of taking care when traveling to areas where these creatures are present. However, it is important not to let fear dictate our actions, and to continue exploring the world while taking the necessary precautions to stay safe.
