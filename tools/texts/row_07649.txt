article: LONDON, England (CNN) -- British confectioner Cadbury has recalled all of its Chinese-made candy products over fears that they may be contaminated with the chemical melamine, a company statement said Monday. "The products that are affected by this withdrawal include a range of Cadbury chocolate products and Choclairs, all produced in our Beijing plant," Cadbury said in a statement. Some or all of the products were exported to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Australia, the Pacific island of Nauru and Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean, according to the company. Cadbury said that it is implementing new food safety and quality checks at its Beijing plant and that fresh candies will be manufactured. The candy maker is the latest company to get caught up in China's tainted-milk scandal. Melamine was first found in powdered infant formula but has since been traced to dozens of other products. Nearly 53,000 children in China have been sickened by the formula or other products containing melamine. Four babies have died, and five Hong Kong children have suffered melamine-related illnesses. Dozens of countries have banned or recalled Chinese milk products.  Watch how scare affects companies outside China » . Chinese police have arrested 40 people in the tainted-milk scandal, including 22 announced Monday in northern China's Hebei province. Nineteen of those were managers of pastures, breeding farms and milk-purchasing stations, the Xinhua news agency reported, citing a panel investigating the case. Authorities say they raided 41 locations in Hebei and seized 490 pounds (222 kilograms) of melamine. Eighteen arrests were announced earlier. They include two brothers who face charges of selling contaminated milk. The brothers could face death if convicted, according to China Daily, a state-run newspaper. The raw milk used to produce powdered baby formula had been watered down, and the chemical melamine was added to fool quality checks, the newspaper said. Melamine is commonly used in coatings and laminates, wood adhesives, fabric coatings, ceiling tiles and flame retardants. Some Chinese dairy plants have added it to milk products to make it seem to have a higher protein level. Melamine is the same industrial contaminant from China that poisoned and killed thousands of U.S. dogs and cats last year. Health experts say that ingesting melamine can lead to kidney stones, urinary tract ulcers, and eye and skin irritation. It also robs infants of much-needed nutrition. The following 11 products are included in the recall, according to Hong Kong's Centre for Food Safety: . • Cadbury Dark Chocette, 45 grams. • Cadbury Dark Chocette, 80 grams. • Cadbury Eclairs, 180 grams. • Cadbury Dairy Milk Chocolate Pumpkin, 150 grams. • Cadbury Dark Chocolate, 40 grams. • Cadbury Dairy Milk Chocolate Bulk Pack, 5 kilograms. • Cadbury Dark Chocolate Bulk Pack, 5 kilograms. • Cadbury Dairy Milk Hazelnut Chocolate Bulk Pack, 5 kilograms. • Cadbury Dairy Milk Cookies Chocolate Bulk Pack, 5 kilograms. • Cadbury Hazelnut Praline Chocolate (2008 Chinese New Year), 312 grams. • Cadbury Dairy Milk Chocolate (2008 Chinese New Year), 300 grams.

chatgpt: The tainted milk scandal continues to rock the dairy industry, as more arrests were made in connection with the use of melamine in the production of milk products. The latest development in the case involves the recall of all products produced in Cadbury's Beijing plant, following the discovery that they may have been contaminated with the chemical. Cadbury's is just one of the many companies affected by the scandal, as the candy produced at the Beijing plant was distributed in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Australia and two small islands. The recall includes all Cadbury's products produced in the Beijing plant, regardless of the best before date. This comes after the Chinese authorities arrested another 22 people in connection with the milk contamination case, bringing the total number of arrests to 40. The arrests include dairy farmers, company officials and middlemen who were involved in the sale of contaminated milk. The contamination of milk with melamine, an industrial chemical used to make plastics and fertilizers, has been a major issue in China for several years. In 2008, six babies died and over 300,000 became ill after consuming tainted milk in China. The chemical was added to milk to give the impression of higher protein levels, and the scandal sparked global outrage over food safety in China. Although the Chinese government has taken steps to address the issue, the latest contamination case shows that the problem is far from over. Cadbury's is just one of the many international companies that have been affected by the scandal, and consumers around the world are concerned about the safety of food products from China. In response to the latest contamination case, Cadbury's has assured its customers that it has taken the necessary precautions to ensure the safety of its products. The company has stated that it has conducted extensive testing of its products and that it has not found any evidence of melamine contamination. However, consumers around the world remain concerned about the safety of food products from China. Many people have called for stricter safety regulations and greater transparency in the food industry. The latest developments in the milk contamination case highlight the need for greater awareness of food safety issues and the importance of taking steps to ensure the safety of food products. While the Chinese authorities have made arrests in connection with the case, it is clear that more needs to be done to prevent such incidents from happening in the future. In conclusion, the recall of all Cadbury's products produced in the Beijing plant underscores the far-reaching impact of the milk contamination scandal. The arrests of more individuals in connection with the case highlight the ongoing need for vigilance in monitoring food safety in China. As consumers around the world continue to demand safer and more transparent food products, it is up to both the government and the food industry to take the necessary steps to ensure the safety of our food supply.
