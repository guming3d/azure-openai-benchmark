article: Doctors who scanned a toddler's chest to try and discover what he had swallowed were shocked to find an image of the cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants staring back at them. Dr Ghofran Ageely, a radiology resident at the King Abdulaziz University Hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, said she screamed when reading the X-ray. The 16-month-old hospital patient had been brought in because he appeared to have swallowed an object. A 16-month-old toddler taken to hospital in Saudi Arabia, his parents fearing he had swallowed something, was found to have ingested a SpongeBob SquarePants pendant, owned by his sister . But medics were amazed to see the character, smiling and with his tongue sticking out, looking back at them from the image. Dr Ageely told Livescience the rogue SpongeBob turned out to be a pendant, owned by the toddler's older sister. She said the first X-ray captured an image of the child's side. From it, Dr Ageely could see there was something - a thin object - lodged in the boy's oesophagus. She suspected it was a pin or hair accessory. 'Then I opened the frontal view and was shocked, "SpongeBob", I screamed,' she said. 'I was amazed by the visible details, you can see his freckles, shoes and fingers.' The pendant was removed from the boy's throat and he was discharged to recover at home. The images were later shared on a forum where radiologists and medical students discuss cases, including foreign bodies. Dr Andrew Dixon, the managing editor of Radiopaedia, and a radiologist at The Alfred Hospital in Melbourne, said: 'We see a lot of amazing X-rays on our site, but this one is particularly amazing.' He said the detail on the pendant was so clear because it was made up of tiny ridges in the metal's surface. Radiologists were shocked to see the cartoon character's face staring back at them, left.

chatgpt: A 16-month-old boy in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia had an unexpected image on his X-ray examination that amazed the radiologist. Instead of a typical illustration of organs and bones, the X-ray showed the clear outline of a cartoon character etched onto the metal pendant stuck in the toddler's chest. The young boy was taken to the hospital in Jeddah by his worried parents after they discovered that their son had swallowed a pendant owned by his sister. The metal pendant was shaped like a small locket and had an image of a popular cartoon character etched onto it. When the radiologist teams reviewed his X-rays, the cartoon character's clear image etched into the pendant could be seen inside the toddler's chest, a rare sight in the medical industry. The picture was so precise, and it was jaw-dropping that it was etched into the metal rather than painted said the radiologist. The doctors took immediate action to retrieve the pendant from the boy's system. They decided that conducting an endoscopy would be a safe and effective method to remove the metal locket from the little boy's chest. Subsequently, the treatment was successful, and the young boy was discharged from the hospital within a few days of admission. Swallowing objects is common among young children. The reason for this is their natural curiosity, combined with their tendency to explore using their mouths. However, it is extremely dangerous as the object may be lodged in a position that blocks airways or sustains internal injuries. In conclusion, the tale about the 16-month-old boy who swallowed a pendant owned by his sister in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, was made remarkable by the cartoon character etched onto it.  The radiologist was impressed and stunned by what he saw, and medical professionals were quick to recover the pendant through an endoscopy. Parents need to take extra precautions to avoid such incidents as young children are naturally curious and tend to put things in their mouths.
