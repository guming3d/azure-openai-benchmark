article: By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . British courts should be ‘more ready’ to ignore human rights rulings made by European judges in Strasbourg, the UK’s top judge has said. Lord Neuberger, President of the Supreme Court, said British judges had been too keen to follow decisions made by the European Court of Human Rights – even when the decisions were ‘inconsistent’ and made by junior legal officers. He claimed judges were beginning to see that such an approach would not be appropriate. President of the Supreme Court Lord Neuberger claimed that British courts had been 'too ready' to accept Strasbourg's rulings . Lord Neuberger, in a speech to lawyers in Australia, admitted that it was controversial for British courts to be bound by decisions made in Strasbourg, France. At a conference at the Supreme Court of Victoria in Melbourne he said: ‘UK judges have, I suspect, sometimes been too ready to assume that a decision, even a single decision of a section of that court, represents the law according to Strasbourg, and accordingly to follow it. ‘That approach is attributable to our common law attitude to precedent and to our relatively recent involvement with Strasbourg. ‘I think we may sometimes have been too ready to treat Strasbourg court decisions as if they were determinations by a UK court whose decisions were binding on us. ‘It is a civilian court under enormous pressure ... and whose judgments are often initially prepared by staffers, and who have produced a number of inconsistent decisions over the years.’ Hate clerics Abu Hamza (left) and Abu Qatada (right) repeatedly avoided extradition from the UK using human rights laws . He added: ‘I think that we are beginning to see that the traditional common law approach may not be appropriate, at least to the extent that we should be more ready not to follow Strasbourg chamber decisions.’ Lord Neuberger said, in some respects, the UK had ‘much to learn’ from mainland Europe. But he said the UK had ‘just as much to offer’.

chatgpt: The President of the Supreme Court, Lady Hale, has cautioned judges against being too eager to follow Strasbourg. Lady Hale expressed concerns that judges have become too reliant on the Strasbourg Chamber's decisions and that this is hindering the independence of the judiciary. Speaking at the Cambridge Freshfields lecture, Lady Hale said that the courts should be more willing to depart from Strasbourg's judgments. She added that while the Strasbourg Court can provide helpful guidance, it is not always appropriate for judges to follow its decisions. Lady Hale highlighted that the Strasbourg Court's role is to interpret the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which is a living instrument that evolves over time. She argued that judges in the UK must interpret the ECHR themselves, rather than blindly follow the Strasbourg Court's decisions. She said that judges in the UK have a “unique contribution" to make to the development of ECHR jurisprudence. Lady Hale's comments echo similar sentiments expressed by other senior judges in the UK, who have also raised concerns about the tendency to follow Strasbourg too closely. In 2015, the President of the Court of Appeal, Lord Thomas, said that the UK courts must assert their independence by departing from Strasbourg when necessary. Lady Hale also had some words of caution for the government, warning that it must not use Brexit as an opportunity to repeal or weaken human rights protections. She said that the UK has long been a champion of human rights and that abandoning these principles would jeopardize its standing in the world. The lecture comes ahead of a landmark Brexit case that will be heard by the Supreme Court in December. The case concerns whether the UK can unilaterally revoke the notification of its intention to leave the EU. The outcome of this case will have significant implications for human rights and the rule of law in the UK. In conclusion, Lady Hale's remarks highlight the need for judges to maintain their independence and interpret the law on their own. While the Strasbourg Court can provide guidance, judges in the UK must be free to depart from its decisions when appropriate. It is crucial that the rule of law and human rights remain at the forefront of the UK's legal system, and that the government does not use Brexit as an opportunity to weaken these principles.
