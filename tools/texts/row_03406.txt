article: A security company selling Samsung Galaxy S3s with enhanced encryption says it has found 19 'phony cell towers' located throughout the United States. Customers using the Cryptophone 500, sold by ESD America, have detected signals from transmitters masquerading as cell towers that, if a cell phone connects to it, can track the phone's location or leave data on its operating system vulnerable to attacks. A map released by the company shows hits for these fake towers in New York City, Chicago, Dallas and Los Angeles. ESD America's CEO, Les Goldsmith, told Popular Science one tower in Nevada was found near a government facility out in the desert. Targeted: Though it is unclear who operates them, ESD America's customers found 19 'fake cell towers' throughout the US . Though it isn't clear who installed these 'towers,' devices with the ability to trick cellphones into connecting to their network have existed for decades. The Wall Street Journal reported in 2011 that the Federal Bureau of Investigations used a device known as a stingray to catch tax fraud Daniel David Rigmaiden. The Los Angeles Police Department purchased a stingray and used it to monitor 21 individuals, according to L.A. Weekly. Critics question the constitutionality of stingrays. The LAPD used the device to track burglary and murder suspects, in spite of stating the device would be used for 'regional terrorism investigations' in a grant application submitted to the Department of Homeland Security. Popular Science reports that the devices target a smartphone's 'baseband operating system,' which receives radio signals such as cellular, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. This functions together with a smartphone's more user-friendly operating system and personal data can be vulnerable on some phones where the two operating systems communicate. InfoWorld reports that developers of the Android-replacing operating system Replicant found such a vulnerability in some Samsung Galaxy phones. Detection: A screenshot from a Cryptophone 500 provided by ESD America shows the phone finding a possible dummy tower . Those worried about the false towers popping up across the map will have to ask themselves what it's worth to defend their data, as phones from Los Angeles-based ESD America - Samsung Galaxy S3s running an operating system licensed from a German technology company - cost $3,500 according to MIT Technology Review.

chatgpt: In recent news, it has been reported that 19 false cell towers have been spotted in major cities across the U.S. Including New York City, Chicago, Dallas, and Los Angeles. There is much speculation as to who is behind these towers, but some believe they could be stingrays, which have been used by police departments for years, despite legal questions surrounding their use. A stingray is a type of mobile surveillance device that mimics a cell tower in order to intercept and collect mobile phone data. While law enforcement agencies have claimed that the use of stingrays is necessary for catching criminals, civil liberties groups argue that their use violates the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which protects citizens from unreasonable searches and seizures. The recent discovery of the 19 false cell towers has alarmed many privacy advocates and raised further questions about the use of stingrays. It is still unclear who is behind these towers, but there are concerns that they may be used for nefarious purposes, such as stealing personal information from unsuspecting citizens. In response to these concerns, a company called ESD America has developed a solution to protect against stingrays. The Cryptophone 500, which is sold for $3,500, runs an operating system licensed by a German company on a Samsung Galaxy S3. The phone is designed to detect and alert the user if it is being targeted by a stingray. While some may argue that the Cryptophone 500 is a necessary tool for protecting one's privacy, others may question whether it is worth the high cost. Additionally, the fact that the operating system is licensed by a German company may raise concerns about whether or not it is secure. Despite these concerns, the recent discovery of the false cell towers highlights the need for individuals to take steps to protect their privacy. As technology continues to evolve, it is important for individuals to remain vigilant and stay informed about the risks and potential threats to their privacy. In conclusion, the discovery of the 19 false cell towers has sparked a renewed debate about the use of stingrays and the need for individuals to protect their privacy. While the Cryptophone 500 may be a solution for those who can afford it, it is clear that more needs to be done to address the use of stingrays and ensure that citizens' privacy rights are protected.
