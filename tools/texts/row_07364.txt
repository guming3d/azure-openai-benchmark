article: Google will pay $3.2 billion to buy Nest Labs, a company that develops high-tech versions of devices like thermostats and smoke detectors, in its second-largest acquisition ever. The search engine operator was an early investor in Nest Labs. It says the company's Nest Learning Thermostat has been a 'consistent best-seller'. The thermostat, which retails for $249, is designed to learn how inhabitants like their homes to be heated and cooled. Once it learns the consumers' preferences, it automatically adjusts the temperature on its own. Google will shell out $3.2 billion for Nest Labs, a company founded by gadget guru and former Apple technician Tony Fadell (pictured) that creates 'smart' home products like smoke alarms and thermostats . The Nest Learning Thermostat, which is the company's best seller and retails for $249, learns how the owners like to heat and cool their homes and makes adjustments on its own . Google's latest acquisition - its second largest after buying Motorola in 2012 for $12.5 billion - marks yet another expansion for the company beyond internet search advertising . Its Nest Protect alarm is intended to be less annoying than traditional alarms: when it detects rising smoke or carbon monoxide levels, it lights up yellow and speaks with human voice, giving consumers an option to turn the device off if there is no emergency. They can stop the alert by waving an arm. The Nest Protect costs $129 while an older smoke and carbon monoxide detector could cost $50 to $80. Analyst Shyam Patil of Wedbush Securities said Google is positioning itself to offer products that work on the 'Internet of Things' - specifically a 'connected home' full of intelligent wireless devices that collect data and could be controlled with a smartphone. The 'Internet of Things' is a global network that not only links computers, tablets and phones but connects everything from bikes to washing machines to thermostats. Last year Google introduced Chromecast, a device that lets users connect their TVs and mobile devices. The Nest smoke alarm, which costs $129, can be turned off by users by a wave of the arm . 'It's a big market opportunity and it provides Google with good technology to attack it over time,' Patil said in a telephone interview. He has a 'Neutral' rating on Google shares. The deal represents Google's biggest since it closed on the $12.5 billion purchase of Motorola in May 2012. Nest Labs is based in Palo Alto, California. It was founded in 2010 by Tony Fadell, a gadget guru who helped design the iPod and original iPhone while working at Apple. Google Inc. is based in Mountain View, California. Its shares fell $7.20 to $1,122.98 on Monday before the report and rose $6.02 to $1,129 in aftermarket trading.

chatgpt: Google has acquired Nest Labs, a company known for its thermostat and smoke alarm products that use sensors and computer technology to make them more useful, for a reported $3.2 billion in cash. The acquisition is Google's second-largest, after buying cellphone maker Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion in 2012.  Nest Labs was started in 2010 by Tony Fadell, a gadget guru who helped design the iPod and original iPhone while working at Apple. In recent years, Nest Labs has gained a reputation for its sleek, well-designed products that are powered by machine learning. The acquisition of Nest Labs is part of Google's expansion outside of internet search advertising, as the company seeks to become a key player in the growing market for smart home devices. Google is betting that Nest's products, which are designed to help people save energy and create a more comfortable living environment, will be a hit with consumers. "Nest's founders, Tony Fadell and Matt Rogers, have built a tremendous team that we are excited to welcome into the Google family," said Google CEO Larry Page in a statement. "They're already delivering amazing products you can buy right now--thermostats that save energy and smoke/CO alarms that can help keep your family safe. We are excited to bring great experiences to more homes in more countries and fulfill their dreams!" The acquisition of Nest Labs is also part of Google's broader efforts to expand its reach beyond the web and into the physical world. The company has already made significant investments in driverless cars, robotics, and artificial intelligence, and the acquisition of Nest Labs is likely to further accelerate these efforts. Many analysts believe that the acquisition of Nest Labs is a smart move for Google, as the market for smart home devices is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years. According to a recent report from research firm IDC, the market for smart home devices is set to triple from $37 billion in 2020 to $123 billion in 2025. However, the acquisition has raised concerns among some privacy advocates, who worry that Google's access to Nest's data could lead to further violations of consumer privacy. Others have criticized Google for its track record on acquisitions, which have sometimes led to the dissolution of promising startups and the loss of innovation. Still, many experts believe that the acquisition of Nest Labs could ultimately prove to be a major win for Google, as the company continues to expand its reach and find new ways to innovate in the rapidly evolving tech industry. With its focus on smart home devices and the internet of things, Nest Labs could play a key role in shaping the future of the technology landscape for years to come.
