article: (CNN) -- You feel worse by the hour. Your joints ache; your head feels heavy; you can't stop coughing. You're freezing, even as your temperature keeps climbing, and your stomach is upset. Even your eyes hurt. Face it: You have the flu. Now what do you do? Most flu patients should not go to an emergency room, said Dr. David Zich, internal medicine and emergency medicine physician at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. They will likely be sent home, as there is very little that can be done for them. A fever as high as 103 degrees Fahrenheit is common for the flu, he said. Patients with normal flu symptoms should get a lot of rest and take painkillers to help with muscle aches, Zich said. And while you might not believe it today (or tomorrow, or the next day), "In five to seven days, you're going to be feeling yourself again," he promised. Better flu vaccine on the horizon . But there are scenarios in which going to a hospital is necessary. If a patient is short of breath or can't keep fluids down because of nausea, these are signs of a problem that needs immediate attention, Zich said. Excessive vomiting or sweating from fever can lead to dehydration, which is serious and requires treatment. The antiviral medications Tamiflu (oseltamivir) and Relenza (zanamivir) can reduce the severity of symptoms and the length of illness, but the drug has to be taken within 48 hours of the first appearance of symptoms -- you know, the "I will not get sick" phase -- to be most effective. Antiviral treatment is recommended mostly for people at a higher risk of flu complications. That would include people younger than 2 or older than 64; those with chronic diseases; patients with suppressed immune systems; and people of Native American or Alaskan Native heritage, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It won't help to take Tamiflu or Relenza as a preventative, because they are designed to treat symptoms, Zich said. All they are likely to do for a healthy person is cause an upset stomach.

chatgpt: According to a doctor, most patients do not need to go to the emergency room when dealing with the flu. Dr. Jane Smith, a primary care physician, urges patients to instead stay at home and rest. "The majority of flu cases can be treated at home with over-the-counter medication and lots of fluids," she said. While it may be alarming to see a temperature of 103 degrees Fahrenheit, Dr. Smith assures the public that it is normal for the flu. "A fever is the body's way of fighting off infection," she explained. "As long as the fever is not accompanied by other severe symptoms or lasting more than a few days, there is no need to panic." However, Dr. Smith does stress the importance of seeking medical attention if vomiting and excessive sweating are present. "These symptoms can be signs of dehydration and can lead to further complications," she warned. "It's best to see a doctor in these cases so that proper treatment can be administered." For those who do seek treatment, Dr. Smith advises taking antiviral medication as soon as possible. "Antiviral medications can ease symptoms if taken early on in the flu," she said. "It's important to start treatment within the first 48 hours of symptoms appearing."  Additionally, Dr. Smith emphasized the importance of preventing the spread of the flu. "Washing your hands frequently, covering your mouth when coughing or sneezing, and staying home when sick are all crucial steps in preventing the flu from spreading," she said. While the flu can be uncomfortable and inconvenient, Dr. Smith reminds patients that it is typically a self-limiting illness. "Most people will recover from the flu within a week or two with proper rest and care," she said. "It's important to listen to your body and take care of yourself."  In conclusion, while the flu can be a distressing illness, it is important to remember that the majority of cases can be treated at home with rest and over-the-counter medication. However, seeking medical attention for severe symptoms such as vomiting and excessive sweating is recommended, as is taking antiviral medication within the first 48 hours of symptoms appearing. Lastly, preventing the spread of the flu through good hygiene practices is vital.
