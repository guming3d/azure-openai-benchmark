Fish faux-pas: Venezuelan president Nicholas Maduro muddled the word for 'fish' with 'penises' Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro appeared to make a mistake of Biblical proportions this week - when he muddled a well-known religious quote and said Christ multiplied loaves and 'penises'. Maduro made the unfortunate error during a speech on education at the Miranda stadium, in the country’s capital, Caracas. Referring to the iconic story of when Christ multiplied fish and loaves to feed the populace, Maduro said his government would help expand education in the country, 'school by school, child by child, high . school by high school, community by community — to embed ourselves in . there. 'To multiply ourselves like Christ multiplied the penises — sorry, . the fish — and the bread.' The Spanish word for 'penises' (penes) is just one letter away from the word for 'fish' (peces). The Venezuelan premier, who was dressed in a bright red, blue and yellow Adidas track suit - to reflect the colours of the national flag - immediately sparked a storm among Twitter users. Sofy Cortez wrote: 'Hahaha so I just read about Nicolas Maduro's speech and Christ did what?!?!? He multiplied "penises"?!?!? God bless!' Another user, LayNG, wrote: 'Panes + Peces = PENES #EpicFail @NicolasMaduro'. Maduro took over as interim president of Venezuela following the death of Hugo Chavez on March 5. He later won an election against the opposition candidate Henrique Capriles. Despite only being in power for five months, Maduro has courted controversy on more than one occasion. He has been blamed for a toilet paper shortage throughout the country, apparently slept in Chavez's mausoleum, has made a number of anti-gay slurs and offered asylum to NSA leaker Edward Snowden. Maduro also made a lingual faux pas earlier this month when, according to the Latin Times, he incorrectly pronounced the Spanish word for 'millions', making it a feminine noun instead of a masculine noun.

chatgpt: Venezuelan President, Nicolas Maduro, has caused quite a stir on social media after he made a linguistic blunder during an education speech. Maduro, who took over from the late Hugo Chavez in March, muddled the Spanish words for "fish" and "penises" leading to an immediate backlash on Twitter. The President was giving a live speech about his government's achievements in the education sector when he used the wrong word for "fish." Maduro had meant to say "el boquerón" (anchovy), but instead said "el bocón," which means "big mouth" or "loudmouth." The next words out of his mouth, "se dice así o no?" (is that how you say it or not?), sent the crowd into a frenzy, as they realized what he meant. Maduro quickly realized his mistake and tried to correct it, but by that time the damage had been done. Twitter users across the world began mocking and ridiculing him for the gaffe, with the hashtag #MaduroPene (Maduro Penis) trending for hours. While some Twitter users saw the funny side of the incident, others questioned the President's ability to lead the country effectively, with some pointing out that his linguistic skills were not up to the required level for a national leader. The incident has highlighted the concerns many Venezuelans have about Maduro's leadership, with the country currently facing serious economic and political challenges. Maduro's presidency has been marred by a worsening economic crisis, political protests, and allegations of corruption. Despite the criticism he has received, Maduro remains popular among his base, and has shown no signs of bowing down to his critics. He has responded to the criticisms by accusing his opponents of being petty and jealous of his success. The incident has raised questions about the importance of language skills for national leaders, with some suggesting that it is essential for leaders to have a good command of the country's official language in order to communicate more effectively with the public and avoid any embarrassing gaffes. Maduro has yet to comment further on the incident, but it is likely that the social media backlash will continue for some time to come. Whether he will be able to turn around his presidency and lead the country out of its current crisis remains to be seen.
