article: (EW.com) -- Heavy may be the head that wears the crown, but hot is the head that's third in line. Prince Harry, 28, has been named the Top Bachelor, according to the editors at Town & Country, which named the current top 50 bachelors in the world. "Prince William's baby brother flirts and flies Apache helicopters with equal aplomb," the magazine wrote. The list isn't very Hollywood specific (although both George Clooney and Jack Nicholson made the cut). Instead, in addition to the prince, people like Ralph Lauren's son, Andrew, President Obama's speechwriter Jon Favreau, and Greek shipping heir Stavros Niarchos (who has dated both Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton) snagged a spot. Most hilariously, still-just-a-high-schooler Conor Kennedy made the cut. The magazine said it best: "A mere child to some, this Deerfield Academy junior and son of Robert Kennedy Jr. was a gateway to the compound for Taylor Swift. Now he's lyric fodder." Insert your own 'never, ever wanting to get back together' joke here. 'NCIS' high, 'New Girl' low: Ratings . It's hard to make an argument against Harry's No. 1 ranking (although seeing all the attention the Duchess of Cambridge receives on a daily basis could make some women want to run for the hills). More so than normal, Harry has been in the public eye this year, whether he was losing his clothes in Las Vegas or cheering on Olympians at the London Games. "Harry might not possess a towering intellect," the magazine explained. "But he is cooler and more appealing than his older brother, sweet as William undoubtedly is." You guys! Town & Country just called William a nerd! Does anyone even remember when William was considered the dreamboat of the two? His big bro may be taken, but word of advice to any woman trying to snag the fun-loving, polo-playing prince so that they can go on double dates with Will and Kate: You'll have to contend with all-too-real Harry Hunters (not a Potter reference) in your quest for the Most Eligible Bachelor â€” and those ladies mean business.

chatgpt: The editors at Town & Country have made their annual selection for the Top Bachelor, and this year the title has been bestowed upon none other than Prince Harry. The younger of the two princes has many admirers, both in his home country of the United Kingdom and around the world. And now, the editors at Town & Country have affirmed his status as a truly eligible bachelor. According to the magazine, Prince Harry was chosen because he is "cooler and more appealing than his older brother." This assessment might come as a surprise to some, given that Prince William is the future king of England and has long been considered one of the most eligible bachelors in the world. However, it seems that the editors at Town & Country were looking for something a bit different this year – and they found it in Prince Harry. The list compiled by Town & Country isn't focused solely on Hollywood celebrities, although a couple of big names did make the cut. George Clooney and Jack Nicholson were among the other bachelors featured in the magazine's pages. However, it's clear that Prince Harry stole the show. There are a few reasons why Prince Harry is such a popular bachelor. For one thing, he's incredibly charming and charismatic. He has a winning smile and a laid-back demeanor that endears him to people from all walks of life. He's also very active in charitable causes and has been known to use his platform to raise awareness about important social issues. In addition, Prince Harry has a bit of a rebellious streak – something that makes him all the more appealing to many people. He has been known to party and let loose from time to time, which sets him apart from the more buttoned-up members of the royal family. This rebelliousness has earned him a bit of a bad-boy reputation, but it seems that this only adds to his allure. Of course, Prince Harry's most recent romantic entanglement might also play a role in his popularity. After years of being deemed a confirmed bachelor, he recently announced his engagement to American actress Meghan Markle. This news sent shockwaves around the world, as people clamored to learn more about the couple and their upcoming wedding. While Prince Harry might be off the market for now, it's clear that he will remain a beloved bachelor in the eyes of many. He has captured the hearts of people around the world with his charm, wit, and activism. And, at least for the editors at Town & Country, he is the reigning king of bachelors – cooler and more appealing than anyone else on the list.
