Hanging on: The frog was pictured trying to scamper to safety close to El Arenal Volcano in Costa Rica . He said: 'This particular photograph was a very difficult capture to achieve, these frogs are always moving. 'This one was in a hurry climbing those threads as she was exposed to snakes and other predators.' Red eyed tree frogs, otherwise known as agalychnis callidryas, often rely on camouflage to protect themselves. During the day, they stay motionless, cover their blue sides with their back legs, tuck their feet under their stomachs, and shut their eyes. Safety: The frog clambers up a tree thread to the safety, and camouflage, of the trees . When doing this, they can make themselves appear almost completely green, and well hidden among the plants and grass they live in. Nicolas said: 'They are nocturnal so during day times they tend to hide and rest under big banana leafs. 'Everybody loves tree frog pictures even more if they are different and original, not the usual tree frog on a flower perch. Tiny: Red eye tree frogs grow to a little under 8cm at the most. Here the frog is seen sitting on some coins to illustrate its diminutive size . 'For this one I think I was just in the right place the right time, when I got this shot I was made up. 'I've always had a sharp eye for nature and been fascinated by insects. 'One of the greatest satisfactions of photography is traveling around the world and "capturing" the weird and wonderful creatures and being able to show them to the public.' The frogs, which grow to a maximum of just under 8cm, are native to South America.

chatgpt: A nature photographer, Nicolas Reusens, has captured some breathtaking photographs of frogs near the El Arenal Volcano in Costa Rica. However, the task was not as easy as it seemed, as Reusens struggled to snap the photographs in time. The photographs show the frogs hopping and leaping around on the lush green vegetation near the volcano, giving a glimpse of the magical world of these little creatures. The frog species captured in the pictures are not yet identified, but are expected to be from the region surrounding El Arenal. Reusens shared the details of his adventures and the difficulties he faced while trying to capture these elusive amphibians on camera. He reveals that the biggest challenge was the speed of the frogs. He had to anticipate their movements and be ready to click the snap at just the right moment. "It's no easy feat trying to capture these creatures in their natural habitat," said Reusens. "I have to be patient and wait for the perfect moment. These frogs can move really fast and can disappear in an instant." The photographs provide a rare insight into the world of these fascinating creatures. Frogs are known for their diverse and unique colors and patterns, and each species has its own characteristics and traits. Costa Rica is known for its rich biodiversity and is home to over 200 species of amphibians, including many species of frogs. These frogs play a significant role in the ecosystem by contributing to the food chain and helping to control insect populations. Reusens hopes that these photographs will help raise awareness and appreciation for the unique wildlife found in the region. He urges people to appreciate and protect the environment, so that these creatures can continue to thrive in their natural habitat. The photographs by Nicolas Reusens are a stunning reminder of the beauty and diversity of the natural world. They show the magic of Costa Rica, a country known for its awe-inspiring landscapes and incredible biodiversity.
