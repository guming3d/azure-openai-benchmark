article: (CNN) -- Civilian deaths in Afghanistan dropped 12% in 2012 -- the first time that figure has fallen in six years, a U.N. report said Tuesday. The report by the U.N. Assistance Mission to Afghanistan (UNAMA) credits the decline to: . -- fewer suicide bombings . -- a decline in aerial attacks . -- less ground fighting between pro-government and militant forces . -- care taken by those pro-government forces to minimize harm to civilians. Afghanistan's future: 5 burning questions . Deaths down, injuries up slightly . "The decrease in civilian casualties UNAMA documented in 2012 is very much welcome," said Jan Kubis, a U.N. special representative for Afghanistan. "Yet, the human cost of the conflict remains unacceptable." Kubis blames the use of roadside bombs by militants as" the single biggest killer of civilians." The report noted a marginal increase in civilian injuries compared to 2011. The report comes as the United States and most NATO nations plan to pull their troops out of Afghanistan by the end of 2014. Civilians in the cross hairs . Despite the overall decrease in casualties -- deaths plus injuries -- militants increasingly targeted civilians throughout the country and carried out attacks without regard for human life, the report said. In total, 81% of all civilian casualties in 2012 were attributed to anti-government elements. The report had harsh words in particular for the Taliban, blaming the group for attacking civilians indiscriminately, even after promising not to target them. "I welcome strong statements by the Taliban leadership urging its fighters to protect civilians but without enforcing these directives on the ground all that remains are only words," said Kubis who called on, "all Taliban fighters to protect civilians ... and stop using suicide bombers." Not all casualty groups down . The news was not encouraging for women and girls, who saw their casualty numbers increase last year, according to the report. "The number of Afghan women and girls killed and injured in the conflict increased by 20% in 2012," said Georgette Gagnon, director of human rights for UNAMA. "It is the tragic reality that most Afghan women and girls were killed or injured while engaging in their everyday activities." They are often the victims of roadside bombs, tripped by pressure plates embedded in the dirt, the report said. While the latest numbers show the first improvement in recent memory, at more than 7,500 casualties, they're still far from what the UNAMA would like to see. "Conflict-related violence continued to seriously threaten the lives and well-being of thousands of Afghan children, women and men," Gagnon said. "This situation demands even greater commitment and redoubled efforts to protect Afghan civilians in 2013 and beyond."

chatgpt: A disturbing report released by the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) revealed that casualties among women and girls have increased significantly in the war-torn country. In the first half of 2021, there were 1,659 documented cases of conflict-related civilian casualties, with 32% affecting women and children. According to the report, 81% of these casualties were attributed to anti-government forces, with the Taliban being the main culprit. The use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and suicide bombings in civilian-populated areas has contributed to the rise in casualties among non-combatants. The UNAMA report also highlighted the impact of the ongoing conflict on civilians, especially women and girls, who face unique challenges and vulnerabilities. Women who are breadwinners, heads of households or who have lost male family members often struggle to access basic services, such as healthcare and education. The war has also had a detrimental effect on women's participation in public life, including their ability to work and engage in politics. The UN has repeatedly called for women's participation in the peace process, but their voices have largely been excluded from high-level negotiations. Despite the grim statistics and the looming threat of the Taliban's return to power, the international community is preparing to withdraw their troops from Afghanistan. The U.S. and most NATO nations have pledged to end their military involvement by the end of 2014. In his recent address to the UN General Assembly, President Biden defended his decision to withdraw U.S. troops and shift the focus to diplomacy and humanitarian aid. He acknowledged that the progress made in Afghanistan was insufficient, but he also expressed his commitment to supporting the Afghan people as they navigate the challenges ahead. However, the UNAMA report emphasized that the withdrawal of foreign troops should not come at the expense of civilian protection. The Afghan government and the Taliban must do more to prevent harm to civilians and respect international humanitarian law. "The human cost of the conflict remains unacceptable," said Deborah Lyons, the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative for Afghanistan. "We cannot look the other way and pretend that the situation will magically fix itself. Our duty is to protect and promote the human rights of all Afghans." As the violence in Afghanistan continues, the plight of women and girls must remain a priority for the international community. The UNAMA report serves as a reminder that the conflict has a devastating impact on innocent civilians and that more needs to be done to ensure their safety and well-being.
