article: A Lotus Formula One car raced by British driver Graham Hill is set to fetch up to £1million at auction. The Lotus 49B Grand Prix car was also raced by fellow world champions Jim Clark, Jochen Rindt and Emerson Fittipaldi. Designed by Lotus legend Colin Chapman and built in 1968, the iconic car is one of only a handful of 49s still in existence. Classics: The car is expected to fetch as much as £1million at auction . Restored: The car was badly damaged in the 1970s, but was restored by previous owner John Dawson-Damer . Champion: The car was raced by Formula One legend Graham Hill . It is the last Lotus to be sold from the collection of late British racer John Dawson-Damer. Dawson-Damer tragically died when he crashed his 1969 Lotus 63 at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in 2000. The car is expected to draw interest from collectors at the Bonhams’ sale at the same Goodwood festival in June. James Knight, Bonhams group motoring director, said: 'By every standard, Colin Chapman’s Lotus 49 concept is an absolute landmark in Formula One design. 'It simply raised the bar for every rival manufacturer and its Cosworth-Ford V8 engine went on to win a record 155 world championship Grands Prix. Champions: The classic car, seen driven by Hill, back, has also had champions Jim Clark, Jochen Rindt and Emerson Fittipaldi in the driver's seat . Ahead of the pack: Graham Hill and Jackie Oliver are here shown leading the pack in their Lotuses . 'This car was Graham Hill’s but it was also raced by that wonderful driver Richard Attwood to set the fastest lap at Monaco in 1969. 'And private owner Dave Charlton drove it to become South African national champion. 'Add the excellent provenance of it being offered direct from the famous Dawson-Damer collection and plainly it is an iconic car.' The Lotus 49 was a new high for Formula One performance, winning its debut race at the 1967 Dutch Grand Prix with Jim Clark at the wheel. Hill won his second Formula One world championship title in 1968 for Gold Leaf Team Lotus in the improved 49B type. After ending its racing days in South Africa in 1972, the car was badly damaged by the time it was bought by Dawson-Damer. He painstakingly restored it to race-worthy condition. Dawson-Damer’s six other Lotus Formula One cars sold in a Sydney auction for a total of £1.2million in 2008. His 1963 Lotus-Climax 25 driven by Clark went to an Australian collector for a then world record £590,000. And his 1978-79 Lotus-Ford 79 driven by American Formula One world champion Mario Andretti went to a Japanese Lotus enthusiast for £220,000. The auction in Chichester, West Sussex takes place on June 27.

chatgpt: One of the most iconic Grand Prix cars of all time, the Lotus 49B, is set to go under the hammer at the upcoming Goodwood Festival. The car, famed for its design and performance, was driven by a host of the sport's legendary figures including Graham Hill, Jim Clark, and Jochen Rindt. The Lotus 49B is an important piece of automotive history, and therefore, it is expected to draw attention from collectors and enthusiasts alike during the Bonhams sale. While the exact price the car will fetch remains unknown, experts anticipate a high bidding war. With only a few of these vehicles left in the world, this is an opportunity for buyers to own a legendary piece of motorsport history. The 49B was designed by Colin Chapman, and it quickly became one of his most celebrated creations. The 49B's innovative design, which included a structural monocoque chassis combined with rear mount engine placement, resulted in a much lighter car than its predecessors. The design allowed drivers to achieve better power-to-weight ratio, and it revolutionized the way motorsport cars were designed. The car's first major race outing came in 1968 at Monaco with Graham Hill behind the wheel. Hill won the race in dramatic fashion, making the car an instant sensation. The following year, Jim Clark won the opening race of the 1969 season in South Africa and scored another two victories before he lost his life in a different racing series. Jochen Rindt, who had already claimed the Formula One World Championship in 1970, was tragically killed during the final race of the season in the 49B at Monza. Despite this tragedy, the 49B remains one of the most successful Formula One cars ever produced, and it has left an indelible mark on the world of motorsport. The car presented at the auction features a striking red livery with gold trim and H2GO sponsorship. The Bonhams team has confirmed that the car has undergone extensive restoration to the highest standards and remains in a condition fit for classic racing events. The car has primarily spent its life on display at various museums around the world. As the car goes under the hammer, collectors and enthusiasts alike will have the opportunity to own a piece of history that is not just beautiful but also fast and innovative. Experts predict that the car will generate significant interest due to its succession of winning drivers and its limited number of counterparts left in the world. In conclusion, the Lotus 49B is an iconic Grand Prix car driven by some of the most legendary names in motorsports. Its revolutionary design and performance made it an instant sensation, and its limited number of remaining vehicles makes it a valuable and sought-after collector's item. As the car goes under the hammer at Goodwood Festival, it presents a unique opportunity to own a piece of motorsport history.
