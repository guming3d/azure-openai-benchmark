article: In a scathing report, the U.S. Department of Justice on Monday accused the East Haven Police Department (EHPD) in Connecticut of engaging in a pattern of widespread discrimination against Latinos in violation of the Constitution and federal law. "We find that EHPD engages in discriminatory policing against Latinos, including but not limited to targeting Latinos for discriminatory traffic enforcement, treating Latino drivers more harshly than non-Latino drivers after a traffic stop, and intentionally and woefully failing to design and implement internal systems of control that would identify, track, and prevent such misconduct," Assistant Attorney General Thomas J. Perez wrote in a 23-page letter to the East Haven mayor, detailing the results of a two-year investigation. The letter described the discrimination as "deeply rooted in the Department's culture," and cited a statistical analysis showing how Latinos were "intentionally targeted" for traffic stops. It provided the example of a particular officer's stops -- 40.5% of which were of Latino drivers. Overall, the investigation found that 19.9% of traffic stops made by the EHPD were of Latino drivers, concluding it "shows pervasive discrimination against Latinos on every level of EHPD traffic enforcement activity."  The report also said officers were able to target Latinos by focusing on customers leaving Latino businesses. In addition to the high rate of traffic stops, the report accused some EHPD officers of conducting unauthorized immigration investigations. The report mentioned "numerous incident reports" where EHPD officers contacted Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to check on the status or seek an immigration detention of a Latino person.  Investigators said the tactic was "used to harass and intimidate Latinos rather than pursue legitimate law enforcement objectives." The analysis of the police department's practices against the Latino community said the Connecticut department, at the very least, turned a blind eye to the blatant cases of biased policing and at worst, enabled it.  It also accused the department's leadership of thwarting the investigation by "creating a hostile and intimidating environment" for anyone willing to cooperate with it. CNN reached out to the East Haven Police Department multiple times for comment on Monday. It did not respond. According to 2010 census data, East Haven has a population of some 29,000 people. The vast majority of residents, 88.5%, are white, while 10.3% of the population identifies as Hispanic or Latino.  Close to 3% of residents identify as black or African-American. The findings come on the heels of a federal investigation that began more than two years ago, involving a massive review of EHPD incident reports, documents and interviews of department personnel. The Justice Department said it will meet with community leaders, as well with as municipal agencies to address the concerns raised in the report.  But the federal agency also made clear that the United States may suspend or terminate federal funding if the town fails to address the civil rights violations.

chatgpt: Federal officials have accused police in East Haven, Connecticut of engaging in a pattern of discrimination against Latino drivers. The accusations were made after a long-term investigation by the Department of Justice, which found that East Haven police frequently targeted Latino drivers for traffic stops, made arrests without probable cause, and subjected them to unlawful searches and seizures. The investigation was prompted by complaints from Latino residents and activists, who said they had long been subjected to harassment and intimidation by East Haven police. In a statement released on Thursday, the Department of Justice said the findings "paint a disturbing picture of pervasive and deep-seated bias in policing practices" in East Haven. According to the report, East Haven police targeted Latino drivers regardless of their immigration status, often stopping them for minor traffic violations such as broken taillights or failure to wear a seat belt. Once pulled over, Latino drivers were subjected to a range of practices designed to intimidate and humiliate them, such as being questioned about their immigration status and being ordered to produce documentation. The report also found that many Latino drivers were arrested without probable cause, and that East Haven police engaged in a pattern of illegal searches and seizures. In one instance, police officers searched a man's car without a warrant or his consent, and then seized his wallet and cell phone. The report notes that East Haven police have a history of targeting Latino-owned businesses for surveillance and harassment. The findings of the investigation have raised concerns among civil rights groups and Latino activists, who say they reflect a broader pattern of discrimination against Latinos in the US. "This report confirms what we have been saying for years: that police departments across the country are systematically targeting Latino and immigrant communities," said David Aguilar of the Hispanic Leadership Institute. "It's time for action to be taken to address these issues and hold law enforcement accountable." The accusations against East Haven police have been met with silence from the department, which has not responded to multiple requests for comment. However, officials in the town have previously defended the department, saying that its officers are committed to public safety and have only targeted drivers who were breaking the law. The Department of Justice's investigation is ongoing, and it is unclear what actions will be taken against East Haven police. However, civil rights groups are calling for a comprehensive reform of policing practices in the town, including the implementation of new training programs and the appointment of an independent monitor to oversee police activities. Overall, this report underscores the growing concern about the ways in which law enforcement agencies across the US have targeted minority communities, including Latinos and African Americans. As civil rights groups and activists continue to push for change, it remains to be seen whether these efforts will be successful in bringing about long-term reform.
