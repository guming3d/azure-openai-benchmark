article: By . Rob Cooper . A teacher who force-fed a seven-year-old boy custard, restrained another child with a belt and slapped a third pupil across the face has been banned from the profession. Amanda Whitfield, 60, made the boy - identified only as Pupil A - eat the dessert even though he was crying and gagging at the time. The Teaching Agency panel ruled that feeding a child in this way was 'plainly inappropriate' and she was banned from the profession for two years. Force feeding: Amnda Whitfield, 60, made a boy eat custard when he was crying at St Stephens Primary School in Launceston, Cornwall . Mrs Whitfield was teaching children with learning or communication problems at St Stephens Primary School, Launceston, Cornwall, at the time. The panel was told on a separate occasion she slapped another seven-year-old, known as pupil E, across the face. And the teacher pinched a girl, identified as G, on the nose to force her to open her mouth.. In a fourth separate incident she used a belt to hold a child to a chair and then did not report the incident to more senior staff at the school. Feeding: A boy, seven, was force-fed custard, the panel ruled . The panel, chaired by Kathy Thomson, found five of the nine charges against Mrs Whitfield were proven as they ruled she was guilty of unacceptable professional conduct. They said that the teacher, who had worked at the school for 20 years, had previously enjoyed a 'long and excellent career'. However, she resigned from her post in September 2008. Her ban from the classroom is imposed by Education Secretary Michael Gove. In their ruling, the panel said: 'The proved facts, in our view, indicate misconduct of a serious nature . and conduct that falls significantly short of the standard of behaviour . expected of a teacher. 'We recognise the challenging circumstances in which Mrs Whitfield was working and the complex needs of the children.' They added: 'Mrs Whitfield's actions of inappropriate restraint, slapping a pupil and inappropriate feeding methods jeopardised the safety and well-being of children under her supervision; on these occasions, she failed to understand and act upon her duty to safeguard children in her care.' Mr Gove said that there was a risk the teacher would do the same things again as he backed the findings. He said: 'The facts found proved have put the wellbeing of young and vulnerable . pupils in jeopardy. Furthermore, Mrs Whitfield has shown no real insight . into her behaviour or the effects of that behaviour. 'The panel has judged that there is a real risk that her behaviours will . be repeated given her apparent inability to learn from her experience . and adapt her practices accordingly.' The teacher now has 28 days to appeal the decision to the High Court.

chatgpt: A primary school in Launceston, Cornwall, faced a huge controversy after one of its teachers was found to be guilty of misconduct by a disciplinary panel. The teacher, Amanda Whitfield, had been working at the school for 20 years. Her misconduct was discovered when a boy was forced to eat dessert during a school lunch despite crying and gagging, causing him distress. During the hearing, the panel also heard that Whitfield had held a girl’s nose to force her mouth open. This caused the girl to choke on her food, causing immense discomfort and leaving her feeling embarrassed. The panel proclaimed that the teacher’s actions were “totally unacceptable,” and that she had not displayed professional conduct. Whitfield was banned from teaching for two years as punishment for her disgraceful behavior. The decision was taken to protect children in the future and to ensure that the teacher takes responsibility for her actions. Upon hearing the verdict, the school principal took immediate action and released a statement. They said that the behavior exhibited by Whitfield was completely unacceptable, and the school was ashamed that a teacher could treat their students in this manner. They expressed their sincere apologies to the children and their families who were affected by the teacher’s actions. The principal also stated that the school would be holding meetings with students and parents to discuss the implications of the panel’s decision. They assured everyone that the school would remain vigilant in safeguarding the welfare of its students. The repercussions of Whitfield’s actions go beyond the immediate suffering the children experienced – they could also have serious long-term effects. The incident can cause distress in children and may lead to anxiety, depression, or other mental health conditions. It is essential that the school administration and parents continue to work together to provide support to the students in need. The case also highlights the importance of educating teachers about the adverse effects of misconduct on their students. It is crucial that teachers be held to the highest standards of professionalism and ethical conduct to avoid damage to the mental and physical well-being of their students. The disciplinary action taken against Whitfield sends a clear message and sets a precedent for all educators. It demonstrates that the law is not lenient when it comes to the mistreatment of children, and those who commit such an offense will be held accountable. In conclusion, the ruling made against Amanda Whitfield is a significant step in the right direction as it provides a concrete example of how unacceptable actions toward students are handled. Hopefully, this experience will serve as a reminder to teachers everywhere that their duties go beyond merely instructing a subject in a classroom – they have a vital responsibility to safeguard their students' mental and physical well-being.
