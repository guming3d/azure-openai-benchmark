The problems Japan now faces have raised the specter of another such far-reaching disaster.

"It happens, and you see the coverage on it and the videos, and it's really incredible that something like that can even happen in the world. It opens your eyes, and obviously puts a lot of perspective in your life. "It's a country where I have very great memories from. I started playing there when I was very young, and I always loved my experiences there. So to see it going on there, to its culture and the people, it's really sad." Sharapova, who moved to the U.S. at the age of nine and is now based in Florida, said she wants to highlight the widespread, long-lasting effects that a nuclear accident can create. "In the beginning my job was raising awareness to the world, basically getting the message across that even though something like that happened such a long time ago, it still causes many people (problems) on a daily basis," she said. "Kids that were born and now are having kids, you also find that they have something in their body that's not allowing them to live a normal life from the pollution. "I have never actually been around the area ... I wanted to get all the coverage and all the videos around it, because it's really unbelievable what you see. This big huge area -- it's completely deserted. No-one is around it. "Everyone has completely fled. They took their passports and that's all. That was their only belonging that they really wanted."
