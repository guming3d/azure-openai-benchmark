article: (EW.com) -- With Tara (Maggie Siff) being led away in handcuffs in "Sons of Anarchy's" season 5 finale, it's no surprise that Wendy (Drea de Matteo), Jax's ex-wife and mother of his first-born, Abel, will be back in the picture in season 6. As TV Line was the first to report, de Matteo will reprise her role in multiple episodes. EW has confirmed the return engagement starts with the season 6 premiere in September. In the December finale, Tara had wanted Jax to sign legal documents naming Wendy as their sons' legal guardian should anything happen to them. But after Tara's arrest for conspiring to murder the prison nurse Otto stabbed with the crucifix she'd brought him, Jax tore the papers in half. He'd recently shot up recovering addict Wendy with heroin to discredit her should she try to pursue a custody battle for Abel, so we wouldn't expect him to welcome her help now. 'Dexter': Yvonne Strahovski returning . Chatting with reporters last fall, de Matteo said she believed Wendy's motives for wanting to form a relationship with Abel were pure: "I think she is, probably after all of the treatment that she's been through and now becoming a counselor herself, the healthiest of the bunch. It's pretty crazy.... It's like watching a child grow up, to a certain degree. I think in the very beginning of the series she was extremely, extremely vulnerable. At first she was mess, then she was sober and a raw nerve. Now she comes back with her confidence in tact and not wanting to stir any sâ€” up except to be a responsible party. And it seems the whole entire world has imploded, and she's gonna have a hard time maneuvering within it because nobody's stable over there. She's now become the face of stability (Laughs), which is kind of funny." Connie Britton cast as Adam Driver GF . Also scheduled to make an appearance in season 6: A song on which SOA creator Kurt Sutter collaborated with de Matteo's longtime partner, Shooter Jennings. Sutter wrote the lyrics and Jennings the music. See the original article at EW.com. CLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly . © 2011 Entertainment Weekly and Time Inc.
