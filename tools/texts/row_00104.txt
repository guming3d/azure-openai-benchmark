article: The PanicMe app can send red, amber or green alerts to let up to 30 contacts know you are in danger . Smartphone users can now set off a personal panic button to alert family and friends that they are in danger. PanicMe fires off alerts of differing levels of importance to a chosen network of contacts if the user feels threatened or vulnerable. The sender's location is then pinpointed using GPRS and potential responders can see how close they are so they can put a plan of action in place. Offering a traffic light of options, a red alert tells contacts the sender is in imminent danger of being attacked or hurt, amber suggests you will need help soon, while green means you are in a low risk situation, such as being lost or breaking down. The alerts can be sent to up to 30 contacts and can be accessed by police, who are able to login when notified at their control room. Contacts are notified by pop-messages on their smartphones at regular intervals, with the space between the alerts depending on the panic button option. The alerts only stop once the alarm is deactivated by the sender. The app, which launches this week, was developed by experts at DataMe, who worked alongside local police forces to come up with a program to help people feel safer in their daily lives. Former Deputy Chief Constable David Lindley, who who acted as a consultant on the project, says: 'There may be any number of reasons and circumstances why people feel afraid or vulnerable. 'With so many people these days having a . mobile phone, apps such as PanicMe cannot only help to make those in . need feel much safer but can also give peace of mind to those who care . for them.' The alerts are delivered to your contacts' smartphones, using GPRS to pinpoint your location and showing them how close they are to you . Smartphone users can download a limited option of the PanicMe button for free, but it only offers a green panic alert. The complete version costs £14.99 and is available for the year on Apple, Android and Windows Smartphones. The app's release comes months after a survey by Ipsos Mori and Kings College London found that two thirds of adults did not believe that crime rates were falling, suggesting the public is more wary than ever about their personal safety. It's the latest smartphone add-on which can warn us of potentially dangerous situations - the recently unveiled MyWitness records video and audio to gather evidence during unexpected confrontations.

chatgpt: PanicMe, a new safety app, is set to revolutionize personal safety across the globe. The app sends out red, amber or green alerts to up to 30 chosen contacts when the user feels at risk. PanicMe’s unique features make it easier than ever to find assistance quickly when needed. The app works by pinpointing the user’s location using GPRS and then sends out an alert to the user’s chosen contacts. The contacts receive information on the user’s location, the specific nature of the emergency, and a link to a live map that shows who the closest responders are. The app has been developed in close collaboration with local police forces, ensuring that users have access to the most appropriate and relevant support when they need it most. PanicMe’s founders, two tech entrepreneurs from London, were inspired by their own personal experiences with crime and the lack of support systems available. Andrew and Martin wanted to create an easy-to-use, reliable safety app that would provide reassurance and support to the general public. With its unique features and user-friendly interface, PanicMe is now available to anyone who needs it. The red alert feature is triggered when the user is in serious danger and needs urgent assistance. It notifies the user’s contacts of the emergency and provides a live location so that responders can be sent to the exact location quickly. The amber alert feature is triggered when the user is in a potentially dangerous situation and needs help. For example, if someone is being followed by a stranger or feels unsafe in an unfamiliar area. The alert sends the user’s location and a request for help to their chosen contacts. The green alert feature is for times when the user feels uneasy and wants to let their contacts know where they are. It sends the user’s location to the chosen contacts without raising the alarm level. PanicMe’s founders say that since the app’s launch earlier this year, it has already been downloaded over 100,000 times. They believe that the app’s unique features and collaboration with local police forces have contributed to its growing success. “We wanted to create an app that would help people feel safer in their everyday lives,” Andrew said. “From our own experiences, we knew that many people feel vulnerable when they are out and about, and we wanted to give them a tool that would make them feel more confident and secure.” The app has already been used successfully in several emergency situations, including assaults, car accidents, and lost children. The live map feature has been lauded by many users as a gamechanger, making it easier for responders to locate the user quickly and provide assistance faster. PanicMe is set to expand globally, with plans to launch in several countries over the next year. The app’s developers are keen to work with local police forces in each of these countries to ensure that the app is tailored to the unique needs and challenges of each region. In the age of Covid-19, personal safety is more important than ever before. PanicMe provides peace of mind for anyone who wants to feel safe and secure, whether they are out for a jog around the block or traveling to a new city. PanicMe is available to download now on the App Store and Google Play.
