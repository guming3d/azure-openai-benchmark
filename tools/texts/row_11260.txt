article: Turkey's bid to host the 2022 Ryder Cup is on the rocks over concerns about the environment. Turkey are competing against Austria, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Spain to host the biennial match between Europe and the US. But the developments needed to the Montgomerie Maxx Royal, which was nominated as the Cup course and is this week hosting the Turkish Airlines Open – have been deemed too significant, with the removal of between 6,000 and 15,000 trees necessary to modify the infrastructure.

The Turkish sports minister, Akif Cagatay Kilic, said on Thursday that a new course and infrastructure will need to be built to accommodate the competition. The country is also considering a bid for the staging of the 2026 Ryder Cup. ‘Unfortunately the problem of hosting the Ryder Cup in 2022 is that the Montgomerie course is a resort course and not designed for a big scale golf tournament like a Ryder Cup or even a Turkish Airlines Open,’ said Ahmet Agaoglu, President of the Turkish Golf Federation. ‘If you notice there is not one grandstand on the golf course this week and there is just no place for them due to the enormous amount of trees. ‘We have calculated we would have to cut down 6,000 to 7,000 trees and something like 15,000 trees on the Faldo Course (at the nearby Cornelia) just to make way for everything that goes with hosting a Ryder Cup.

The event was held on the PGA Centenary Course, which was modified for the biennial showpiece . ‘All the trees are numbered and licensed and environmentally it would be impossible to get permission to cut them down.’ He added: ‘We estimate the Ryder Cup will cost Turkey between 100-200 million euros to host and we have shown our commitment to big tournament golf with the hosting again this week of the Turkish Airlines Open. ‘One way or another we will be hosting the European Tour's Final Series until 2023 - that will be the 100th anniversary of the Republic of Turkey. ‘That gives us another nine years and along with the Challenge Tour event, we are already going to spend something like 70-85 million euros on these tournaments. ‘So together with this continued investment and the new Ryder Cup course we will build, that will cost an extra 30-40 million euros, it will show our commitment to European golf.’

chatgpt: Turkey has submitted a bid to host the 2022 Ryder Cup, but the bid is currently in jeopardy due to the required modifications to existing courses. The Montgomerie Maxx Royal, which is currently hosting the Turkish Airlines Open this week, would need to have a massive number of protected trees removed in order to accommodate the Ryder Cup. The Ryder Cup is one of the most prestigious events in the world of golf, and the competition is highly sought after by countries around the world. Turkey has never hosted the event before, and officials are eager to show the world that they are capable of putting on a world-class event. However, the bid is currently in danger due to the environmental impact that would result from making the necessary modifications to the Montgomerie Maxx Royal course. In order to create the optimal playing conditions for the top golfers in the world, a significant number of protected trees would need to be removed. This is a major concern for environmentalists, who argue that the removal of so many trees would have a devastating impact on the landscape and ecosystem. The Turkish government has indicated that they are taking these concerns seriously and are considering alternative options. One potential solution that is being considered is to build a purpose-built course specifically designed to host the Ryder Cup. This would allow Turkey to create a world-class golf facility without having to sacrifice any existing environmental assets. Despite the challenges facing Turkey's bid, officials remain optimistic about their chances of hosting the Ryder Cup. They believe that the country has the infrastructure and resources needed to put on a world-class event, and they are committed to finding a solution that is both environmentally sustainable and economically viable. If Turkey is successful in its bid to host the 2022 Ryder Cup, it would mark a major milestone for the country's growing sports tourism industry. Golf is becoming an increasingly popular sport in Turkey, and hosting a major international event like the Ryder Cup would help to cement the country's reputation as a destination for sports enthusiasts from around the world. In conclusion, while Turkey's bid to host the 2022 Ryder Cup faces significant challenges, the country remains committed to finding a solution that is both environmentally sustainable and economically viable. Whether it be through modifying existing courses or building a purpose-built facility, Turkey is eager to showcase its capabilities as a host nation and put on a world-class event that will be remembered for years to come.
