article: British grandmother Lindsay Sandiford has lost her appeal over a UK Government refusal to fund her legal challenge against her death sentence for drug smuggling. Her lawyers attempted to challenge a High Court ruling that the Government was not legally obliged to pay for 'an adequate lawyer' to represent her after she was sentenced to death by an Indonesian court. But today three senior judges headed by Lord Dyson, Master of the Rolls, dismissed her challenge in the Court of Appeal. British grandmother Lindsay Sandiford has lost her appeal over a UK Government refusal to fund her legal challenge against her death sentence for drug smuggling . The Foreign and Commonwealth Office refused to fund her case as a matter of Government policy. She was sentenced to death by firing squad by a court in Bali for taking £1.6million of cocaine on to the island. In January, the UK High Court upheld the Government's stance of not providing legal funding for British nationals arrested abroad, even in exceptional circumstances. After the High Court gave its decision, Sandiford received a private donation of over £2,500 that enabled her to be represented by an Indonesian lawyer at the subsequent Bali appeal. Having lost that first appeal, she is now in a race against time to raise money to take her case to Indonesia's Supreme Court in Jakarta. The appeal court heard that Sandiford needs about £8,000 to fight on. Lindsay Sandiford sits in her cell knitting while on death row in Kerobokan prison, Bali. She was sentenced to death by firing squad by a court in Bali for taking £1.6million of cocaine on to the island . The sum of £2,000 has already been found, but around £6,000 is still needed from the Government as money from private sources following publicity was 'fully exhausted', said lawyers for Sandiford, who is not entitled to legal aid in Indonesia. Lord Dyson, sitting with two other judges, said the court had given 'very careful consideration' to the issues raised in what he described as a 'troubling' case. He said the reasons for the judgment would be given 'as soon as possible'. Lord Dyson, when announcing the decision to dismiss the appeal, said it was 'obviously a terribly serious matter'. He said it was 'most unfortunate' that the sum required to secure the representation sought by the appellant - roughly £6,000 - was 'relatively speaking' a 'very small sum indeed'. The judge added: 'But that cannot affect the principle that we have had to consider and it cannot affect our decision. 'But it may be that other means may be found to secure the relatively small sum in the course of the next few days.' Rosa Curling, a solicitor with law firm Leigh Day, which is representing Sandiford, said outside court: 'We are obviously very disappointed by the decision and we will consider with our client once we have received the reasoning of the court whether to appeal to the Supreme Court.'

chatgpt: Lindsay Sandiford, a British citizen, has been sentenced to death by an Indonesian court for her involvement in smuggling drugs worth £1.6m. The decision was upheld by three senior judges in the Court of Appeal yesterday, marking a significant setback in Sandiford's bid to avoid execution by the firing squad. The case has been highly controversial, with Sandiford consistently claiming that she was coerced into carrying the drugs by a criminal gang who threatened to harm her family. However, the authorities have rejected her pleas with little sympathy, stating that the death penalty is a necessary deterrent against drug trafficking. Sandiford's case has also highlighted the difficulties faced by foreign nationals when navigating Indonesia's legal system. Notably, her lawyers have struggled to secure sufficient funding for a robust defense, as the state has refused to provide legal aid beyond a very basic level. This has left her at a severe disadvantage compared to her more affluent co-defendants, who have been able to mount more effective legal challenges. Critics have condemned this as a fundamental injustice that undermines the principles of a fair trial. They argue that Sandiford, despite being a British citizen, has been denied the same rights as anyone else prosecuted under Indonesian law. This includes adequate legal representation, which is essential for ensuring that the evidence against her is subjected to sufficient scrutiny. In the Court of Appeal, Sandiford's lawyers made a final push to avoid the death penalty by arguing that the initial trial fell short of the required standards of fairness. However, the judges dismissed their challenge, stating that Sandiford had been given a reasonable opportunity to defend herself and that the death sentence was appropriate given the severity of the crime. The verdict was met with dismay by Sandiford's supporters, who had campaigned tirelessly for her cause. The British government has also expressed its concern at the case, with officials stating that they have repeatedly raised concerns about the use of the death penalty in Indonesia. Some have called for diplomatic pressure to be applied on Indonesia to halt the execution and review Sandiford's case. However, the Indonesian government has rejected these appeals, stating that the country's legal system is sovereign and that it is the prerogative of its courts to determine the appropriate sentences for criminal offenses. The case has generated significant media attention around the world, with many highlighting the harsh conditions faced by prisoners on death row in Indonesia. Sandiford's case has become a symbol of the wider debate about the appropriateness of capital punishment as a means of addressing drug trafficking. As Sandiford prepares to face her fate, many are left with a sense of unease about the fairness of the legal process and the inadequacy of the support provided to vulnerable defendants. The case has raised important questions about the balance between punishment and justice, and the role of the state in ensuring that individuals are treated fairly before the law.
