Mike Tindall couldn't disguise the after-effects of a tiring trip to Hong Kong to play rugby in the intense heat on Saturday, as today he appeared to nod off during the celebrations to mark 60 years since the Queen's Coronation. The former England captain, who is married to Zara Phillips, the Queen's eldest granddaughter, had his eyes closed on a number of occasions during the short service at Westminster Abbey. Days earlier the centre joined the Barbarians team as they played against the British and Irish Lions, but this morning he was paying the price, as he was persistently rubbing his eyes, giving the impression he might be severely jet-lagged. His tiredness seemed so obvious that at one point Queen's son Prince Edward appeared to point to bags under his own eyes while Prince William giggled while looking at his cousin's husband.

He was evidently feeling the jetlag from the near-12 hour flight back from the Far East, where he played for the Barbarians against the Lions in their first warm-up match ahead of their Australian tour. The Gloucester and former England centre joined the Queen, Duke of Edinburgh, Prince of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall and more than 20 royals, including the heavily pregnant Duchess of Cambridge and her husband Prince William, for the religious service. The Queen was crowned on June 2, 1953 . at Westminster Abbey. During his address, the Archbishop of Canterbury . Justin Welby described the Queen's life as one of 'demanding devotion . and utter self sacrifice - a path she did not choose but one she was . called to.' Tindall played 20 minutes for the Barbarians in their 59-8 defeat to the Lions on Saturday. The 'Baa-baas' broke with their long-standing tradition before the match by implementing a self-imposed ‘booze ban’ to enhance their chances of upsetting the Lions. In the aftermath of their abject 40-12 defeat against England at Twickenham three days earlier, Dai Young’s players chose to stay off alcohol for the rest of the week. Their decision went against the invitational team’s age-old pre-match routine, with its heavy emphasis on ‘bonding’ drinking sessions .

chatgpt: Former England captain, Mike Tindall appeared to be jet-lagged as he arrived back from the Far East in the company of his wife, Zara, and members of her family. The group was spotted at Gatwick Airport, and the once proud rugby player appeared visibly tired, with his eyes shut on several occasions. The incident took place on the weekend, and members of the royal family were seen clowning around behind Tindall's back, suggesting that some friendly teasing was at play. Mike Tindall has been spending time in Japan fulfilling his duties as a rugby ambassador for England during the Rugby World Cup. Alongside the likes of Jonny Wilkinson, he has been promoting the game, but it seems that the long-haul flights and tight schedule may have taken their toll on the former player. Ms. Phillips' mother and father, Anne and Mark, as well as her brother, Peter, were all present at the airport to greet the couple. They appeared to be in high spirits, joking around and laughing, but Tindall seemed unamused and withdrawn. Images captured on the day show the former rugby star wearing a green hoodie with a cap pulled down over his face, holding his phone, and appearing generally out of sorts. Despite this, the ever-supportive Zara was by his side, looking fresh and alert, as she trailed behind Tindall. She wore a casual outfit of black leggings and a jacket, carrying a large bag which could have contained supplies for the long flight home. An insider said that Tindall had been working hard in Japan, attending rugby matches and other sporting events. Being away from his young family may have also taken its toll. The couple has two young daughters, Mia and Lena, who Tindall is said to dote on. The royal couple is well-known for its love of sporting events, with both Tindall and Zara regularly attending events together. The duo has been spotted at Wimbledon, as well as attending high-profile rugby fixtures such as the Six Nations tournament. Zara, who is herself an accomplished equestrian, has also represented Great Britain in showjumping before. It remains to be seen how the couple will recover after the long flight and time spent away from their family. Tindall's appearance did little to suggest he was in good spirits, but with the support of his family and wife, he is sure to bounce back in no time.  In conclusion, Mike Tindall's apparent fatigue upon return from a trip to Japan was noted by members of his wife's family as he seemed jet-lagged after a long flight back from the Far East. However, his wife, Zara, stood by her man, offering her unwavering support.
