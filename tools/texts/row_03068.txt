article: (Financial Times) -- China, the biggest consumer of cotton, has lodged a formal protest against India's ban on cotton exports amid signs that India is rethinking the ban that was implemented a few days ago. Manmohan Singh, India's prime minister, urgently requested a group of cabinet members to review the ban after the country's agriculture minister said that the curbs on the fibre would hurt farmers. The outcome of the review would be made public today, a statement from the prime minister's office said. An official in the prime minister's office said cabinet members were likely to lift the ban. "There is a realistic, high chance that the ban will be lifted," the official told the Financial Times. The U-turn is, however, not certain as New Delhi balances its relationship with Beijing and the interests of its farmers with the concerns of its powerful textile industry. The abrupt policy changes are adding further volatility to the cotton market after two years of sharp swings in prices. Cotton rose to an all-time high of more than $2 a pound last year amid a shortage in part created by an export ban by India, only to fall afterwards to less than $1 after cotton mills defaulted on contracts. Cotton traders including Cargill, Noble Group and Glencore suffered big losses as a result. Cotton prices have risen this year after India banned exports for the second time in two years. India, the second-largest producer of cotton, instituted the ban with immediate effect on March 5, in a move aimed at ensuring sufficient supply of cotton for domestic textile companies. India's move came after China had aggressively bought bales over the past year for a government reserve as a way of supporting domestic farm prices and buffering against price volatility. By late January, China had bought as many as 5m bales of foreign cotton for the reserve which, along with its domestic purchases, made up 15 per cent of global cotton consumption in the current crop year, the US Department of Agriculture estimated. This week, Sharad Pawar, agriculture minister, wrote to the prime minister the day after the ban demanding that export of the fibre be allowed. He complained that due to higher production this year, farmers were already suffering from lower prices than they had expected and needed to export to recover their domestic losses. However, India's commerce ministry, which enforced the ban, said domestic textile companies had been complaining that they were finding it hard to compete with rivals in Bangladesh and Pakistan because of rising cotton prices in India. The trade regulator's move is expected to push down cotton prices in the country. Cotton for May delivery was up 0.9 per cent to 90.90 cents a pound on New York's ICE Futures US exchange. Futures peaked earlier this week at 94 cents. © The Financial Times Limited 2012 .

chatgpt: Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has requested a group of cabinet members to review the country’s ban on cotton exports after several major cotton trading companies suffered significant losses. The ban has been in place since early this year and was implemented for the second time in two years. The move caused cotton prices to plummet to below $1, hitting traders such as Cargill, Noble Group, and Glencore particularly hard. The announcement of the export ban came as a shock to the cotton industry, which was just starting to recover from a similar export ban imposed in 2010. The export restrictions were enacted this year to ensure that India had enough cotton for domestic consumption. However, the ban has had detrimental effects on the country’s cotton trade, and it is feared that this could have long-term consequences for the industry. During a recent cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Singh raised concerns about the impacts of the export ban and urged the ministers to review the decision. Many in the government agreed that the ban had been detrimental to the economy, and there were calls to lift the restriction to help revive the cotton industry.  The recent fall in cotton prices has resulted in significant losses for trading companies, including Cargill, which had to write off nearly $100 million from its cotton business. Noble Group also had to warn of lower profits due to the weak performance of its cotton business. Glencore, one of the world’s largest commodities traders, likewise had to contend with losses due to the drop in cotton prices. The current situation has drawn criticism from the cotton industry, with some stakeholders calling for the ban to be lifted immediately. The ban has prevented cotton traders from exporting the crop and selling it at a higher price on the global market. This has led to an oversupply of cotton in India, which has pushed prices down and caused hardship for farmers who are unable to sell their produce at profitable rates. While the Indian government has stated that the ban was implemented to safeguard the country’s domestic market, critics argue that it has only served to create chaos in the cotton industry. The cotton trade is one of India’s major industries, and the country is one of the world’s largest exporters of the crop. The recent ban has impacted not only the trading companies but also the farmers who rely on cotton for their livelihoods. In conclusion, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s request to review the ban on cotton exports comes in the wake of significant losses for companies in the industry, including Cargill and Glencore. The ban has led to a downturn in cotton prices, which has negatively impacted farmers and traders alike. With the industry at stake, it is imperative that the government acts quickly to address the situation in a way that safeguards both India's domestic market and its standing in the global cotton economy.
