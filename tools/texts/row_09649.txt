article: By . Chris Pleasance for MailOnline . A Mormon University in Utah has removed  cards celebrating same-sex marriage from its bookshop because they violate the school's honour code. Card maker Hallmark apparently stocked Brigham Young University shop with 'Mr and Mr' and 'Mrs and Mrs' cards without realising that the religious school does not support same-sex unions. It is not known how long the cards were on the shelves for but they were quickly removed after pictures surfaced online, according to a university spokeswoman. Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, has removed 'Mr and Mr' and 'Mrs and Mrs' cards from its bookshop after card maker Hallmark stocked them without realising the religious school opposes same-sex marriage . The BYU code states that being attracted to people of the same gender is acceptable, acting on those feelings is a violation. Founded by Brigham Young, leader of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in 1875, the school was established as a strict religious institution. Founded as Brigham Young Academy, Mr Young is said to have told the principal: 'Remember that you ought not to teach even the alphabet or the multiplication tables without the Spirit of God.' Today it serves 27,000 undergraduate students and has sister campuses in Idaho, Hawaii and Salt Lake City. 'Homosexual behavior includes not only sexual relations between members of the same sex, but all forms of physical intimacy that give expression to homosexual feelings,' it states. BYU is owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which has stood behind its belief that marriage should only be between a man and a woman. Staff at BYU have spoken with the company about leaving similar cards off university store shelves in the future. The school doesn't plan on ending its contract with Hallmark. 'This was just someone stocking the shelves who wasn't aware," she said. "We've been able to work with them.' A call to Hallmark wasn't immediately returned. Samy Galvez, president of the group Understanding Same Gender Attraction, said changes to the honor code in 2007 and 2010 allowed students to talk about their sexual orientation without fear of being expelled. Though he declined to comment on the greeting cards, calling it an accident, Galvez said he's generally found a welcoming environment at BYU. The BYU honour code states that while being attracted to people of the same sex is not forbidden, acting on those impulses is a violation .

chatgpt: Brigham Young University's bookstore recently came under scrutiny when a customer discovered cards depicting same-sex marriage on its shelves. The cards were produced by an outside company which stocked them without knowing that the university's religion opposes gay marriage. Brigham Young University, located in Provo, Utah, is a private university owned and operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The university's code of conduct, known as the Honor Code, forbids students from acting on homosexual feelings, and students who violate this code can be punished with expulsion. The customer who discovered the cards, Jeff Cartwright, expressed his disappointment in the bookstore's decision to stock them. "I just think it's really inappropriate for Brigham Young University to be selling cards that celebrate something that the university doesn't recognize as a valid lifestyle," he said. In response, the bookstore's manager, Michael Hooper, apologized for any offense caused and vowed to remove the cards from the shelves. "We understand the concerns that have been raised and we take them seriously," he said. "We will be revising our sourcing guidelines to ensure that we do not stock any products that go against the beliefs and values of our university." The controversy highlights the ongoing debate within religious institutions over the acceptance of LGBTQ+ individuals and their relationships. While some churches, such as the Episcopal Church and the United Church of Christ, have embraced LGBTQ+ members and officiate same-sex marriages, others, such as the Roman Catholic Church and Orthodox Judaism, have taken a more conservative stance. Brigham Young University has faced criticism in the past for its treatment of LGBTQ+ students. In 2018, the university removed a section from its Honor Code which banned "homosexual behavior," although it still prohibits students from acting on same-sex attraction. The situation at Brigham Young University is not unique. Many religious institutions struggle to balance their beliefs with the changing attitudes of society, particularly with regards to LGBTQ+ individuals. As the debate continues, it remains to be seen how these institutions will adapt and evolve to meet the needs of their diverse communities.
