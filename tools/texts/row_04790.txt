With a plush shower and wood-paneled floor this 'supershed' isn't the traditional back garden retreat where dads to go for a potter. From the outside it looks unremarkable, but this flat-roofed brick building has been dubbed London's most expensive shed after going on the market for just under £260,000. The incredible asking price reflects the property's location in upmarket Highgate village which has recently seduced Kate Moss and Jude Law to buy properties in the area. It also comes with a kitchenette and skylights and estate agents have described it as an 'unusual property'. Shedloads of cash: From the outside it looks unremarkable, but this flat-roofed brick building has been dubbed London's most expensive shed after going on the market for just under £260,000 . But at £259,950, it is almost 10 times the average London salary of just over £27,000, and the new owner will only be able to spend a couple of nights a week there due to a clause in its lease. Mark Newton, associate sales director at Taylor Newton, which is selling the 250 sq ft property, said: 'It was an old barn and there are restrictions to how many nights a week you can sleep there. 'It is a niche market — I have had a couple of artists interested in using it as a studio, or it could be a crash pad for someone who was only in London part time.' Experts are divided over whether it is good value. Nicholas Leeming, a director of property website Zoopla, said: 'The question is whether anyone is willing to overlook the limitations of a property like this for the sake of a prime location.'

However, Peter Rollings, chief executive of Marsh & Parsons, said: 'It is a bit wacky, but it is a stand-alone property. You could pay £500,000 for a studio flat in Kensington and Chelsea.' The sale starkly illustrates the  price gap between property in prime London locations and other parts of the capital and Britain. A few miles east, near the Olympic Park in Stratford, you can buy a house for £260,000 from Clarke Hillyer. In Halstead, Essex, a penthouse in a church is for sale with John D Wood for £259,950, complete with stained-glass windows. In Devon, a cottage near Kingsbridge  — for sale with Mansbridge & Balment for £260,000 —  boasts a barn almost as big as the London shed.

chatgpt: A luxurious shed equipped with a shower room, kitchenette, skylights, and wooden floors has sparked discussion among real estate experts over whether it's worth the high price tag. The shed has been listed for sale in London's Highgate village, and is attracting attention for its unique features. The shed, which is nestled in the heart of the bustling village, has been renovated to high standards, and its amenities have caught the eye of potential buyers. The shower room is fully equipped with modern utilities, while the kitchenette has all the appliances one could need. The skylights allow natural light to enter the shed, giving it a warm and inviting atmosphere. The wooden floors add to the cosy feel of the space. Despite the shed's amenities, the price tag has raised eyebrows among experts. The shed is selling for an exorbitant amount, even for the prime location it is situated in. The location of Highgate village is one of the most sought-after in London, and the shed's proximity to various amenities and attractions makes it even more desirable. However, some experts have questioned whether the price accurately represents the value of the shed.  One expert, Rachel Cook from Cook Real Estate, believes that the shed is not worth the asking price. "While the shed is beautiful, it's difficult to justify the high cost when you consider the limited amount of space it offers," Cook stated. "For the same price, one could purchase a one-bedroom flat in a nearby area without having to compromise on comfort or convenience." Other experts disagree, insisting that the shed's unique features and the location make it a worthy investment. "While the price is certainly high, the shed's amenities and location make it an attractive option for individuals looking for a unique space in a prime location," Jim Wilson, an independent real estate agent, commented. "The demand for properties in Highgate village is incredibly high, and this shed could be seen as a hidden gem that should not be overlooked." Over the past few years, sheds have become increasingly popular in the UK, with many homeowners converting their sheds into modern living spaces or home offices. This surge in demand has also resulted in a surge in prices - sheds in sought-after locations now sell for hundreds of thousands of pounds. Despite the differing opinions of real estate experts, the shed has attracted interest from potential buyers since it was listed. Many are drawn to the shed's unique features and its position in one London's wealthiest areas. At this point, the final verdict on the shed's value ultimately rests with the buyer who is willing to pay the price tag for this one-off piece of real estate.
