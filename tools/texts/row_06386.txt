article: The mother of a Texas middle school student wants an apology after an administrator colored on her son's head with a dark marker because they claim he had a 'gang-related' haircut. Monica Esquivel's son Kobi was attending Coronado Middle School in Plainview with a haircut featuring a line shaved on the side of his head for the last five months. An assistant principal told Kobi his hair was a 'distraction' and colored in the line with a marker earlier this week. Scroll down for video .

The line that was shaved in Kobi's dark hair (above) was supposed to look like it was a part . Monica Esquivel wants the Plainview Indepedent School District to apologize for what happened with Kobi . Officials from the Plainview Independent School District failed to notify Esquivel about what had happened with her son, KCBD reported. When she did speak to them, school administrators informed her Kobi's haircut could be considered gang related. She said: 'My son is not in a gang, he's not trying to be in a gang. He dresses in khakis, a shirt, not in loose pants or anything, just real nice and casual. 'He isn't representing a gang or anything.' The school district's dress code policy 'prohibits designs shaved into the scalp and this includes lines' The school district's executive director for administrative services, Greg Brown, said any concerns regarding the assistant principal's behavior will be addressed confidentially, according to the Plainview Daily Herald. Brown said district policy 'prohibits designs shaved into the scalp and this includes lines'. He added: 'The dress code is a part of the parent/student handbook that is made available to all students online and in paper form. 'The dress code is specifically looked at by the administration who makes any changes that need to be made.' Final approval about the handbook is usually issued in July. Esquivel wants the Plainview Indepedent School District to apologize to her son and also update its dress code policy. Kobi will be allowed to grow his hair out to cover the shaved line. This situation is similar to one that happened about a year ago in Florida. Last January, a school counselor at Harns Marsh Middle School in Lehigh Acres shaved a student's head because he felt the 11-year-old's hair was a distraction and could be gang related, NBC 2 reported.

chatgpt: A mother in Plainview, Texas, is demanding an apology from the Plainview Independent School District after an assistant principal at Coronado Middle School "fixed" her son's hair without permission. Monica Esquivel claims that her son, Kobi, had the same simple haircut for five months before the incident occurred. According to Esquivel, the assistant principal deemed Kobi's haircut inappropriate and took matters into his own hands. The administrator allegedly used a dark marker to color in the line in the boy's hair to make it appear shorter and more conservative. "I couldn't believe it," Esquivel told reporters. "I trusted the school to take care of my child while he was in their care, and instead they violated his trust and his right to make his own choices about his appearance." Esquivel further explained that Kobi had received compliments on his haircut from his peers and even some of his teachers before the administrator "fixed" it. The incident has caused quite a stir in the Plainview community, with many residents expressing outrage at the school district's actions. Some argue that the assistant principal's actions were an overstep of authority and an infringement on Kobi's individuality. "I think the school owes this mother and her son an apology," said one concerned citizen. "It's not their job to police kids' haircuts, and if parents are okay with it, then that's all that matters." Esquivel echoed this sentiment, stating that she wants the school district to issue a formal apology and take action to ensure that this type of incident does not happen again. "I want the school district to know that what happened to my son was not okay," she said. "I also want to make sure that other parents know that this could happen to their child, and they need to be aware of their rights when it comes to their child's appearance." As of now, the Plainview Independent School District has not issued a statement regarding the incident. However, community members and supporters of Esquivel and Kobi are calling for the district to take action in response to the incident. This incident highlights the ongoing debate surrounding school dress codes and the policing of students' appearances. While some argue that dress codes are necessary for maintaining a professional learning environment, others argue that they can be discriminatory and limit students' freedom of expression. As this debate continues, it is important for school districts to consider the rights and autonomy of their students and their families.
