article: The number of cinema tickets bought in the United States in 2014 fell to its lowest level in nearly 20 years - despite the fact that the box office raked in more than $10 billion. Some 1.259 billion tickets were bought in the past year, the lowest number since 1995 when 1.211 billion people went to the cinema. The figure is down six per cent on the 1.34 billion tickets that were sold in 2013, meaning that 81 million people who went to the cinema last year chose not to in 2014. Guardians Of The Galaxy was the number one film at the US box office in 2014 with ticket sales of $332.8m . The statistics, reported by Deadline, include January 1-December 31. Movie distribution chiefs have put the disappointing sales down to distractions such as video games, the increase in viral videos and online streaming sites such as Netflix. But despite relatively low ticket sales in 2014, as of last weekend six studios had made in excess of $1billion this year, including Fox, Disney, Warner Bros, Sony, Paramount and Universal. In fact, 2014 is the sixth year in a row to pass the $10billion mark and this year's takings are currently three per cent higher than 2011. 1. Guardians of the Galaxy ($332.8m) 2. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay ($306.7m) 3. Captain America: The Winter Soldier ($259.8m) 4. The LEGO Movie ($257.8m) 5. Transformers: Age of Extinction ($245.4m) 6. Maleficent ($241.4m) 7. X-Men Days Of Future Past ($233.9m) 8. Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes ($208.5m) 9. Amazing Spider-Man 2 ($202.9m) 10. Godzilla ($200.7m) This week, figures from Box Office Mojo, reported that Guardians Of The Galaxy was the number one film at the US box office in 2014 with ticket sales of $332.8 million. The Marvel space adventure starring Chris Pratt, 35, as Peter Quill and his alter-ego Star-Lord was released on August 1 and was the first film to pass the $300 million mark this year. The film, also starring Zoe Saldana, Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper, was a  a risk for Marvel as it centered on lesser known comic book characters but it found an eager audience. It was followed closely in second place by The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1, which remains in theaters and has taken in a haul to date of $306.7 million. The film's star Jennifer Lawrence popped up again in the seventh-place finisher X-Men Days Of Future Past which earned $233.9 million. The 24-year-old actress last week was named the highest-grossing actor in Hollywood in 2014 with her films taking in $1.4 billion at the worldwide box office. Marvel also landed the third-highest grossing movie of the year with Captain America: The Winter Soldier starring Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson and Sebastian Stan earning $259.8 million domestically.

chatgpt: This year's movie industry has seen a decline in ticket sales compared to the past year. According to the most recent figures, 1.259 billion tickets for movies were bought, which is the lowest figure since 1995. This generated a six per cent decline compared to the 1.34 billion tickets sold in 2013. Various movie industry stakeholders have commented that the dip in ticket sales can be attributed to a number of distractions that are available nowadays. Movie distribution chiefs suggest that video games, viral videos and streaming sites like Netflix are likely culprits of the decline. The rise of streaming sites is becoming a particular cause for concern in the movie industry. Movie executives worry that the ease of access and affordability of these sites makes them a more attractive option than heading to the cinema. A survey was recently conducted among moviegoers, and it was found that 18-24-year-olds were more inclined to watch movies through legal online streaming channels compared to more traditional methods like going to the cinema. This could be a major problem for the movie industry as they rely on younger audiences as a primary source of income. A lack of original content has also been a major contributor to the decline in ticket sales. Analysts believe that audiences are becoming increasingly discerning, and mainstream movie releases are no longer sufficient to persuade them to buy tickets. Consumers are more in favor of movies that have original content and provide a fresh perspective or approach to storytelling. While there is still a demand for sequels and adaptations, it would seem that moviegoers want variation and fresh content that isn't replicated again and again. In the past few years, franchises like Transformers, Pirates of the Caribbean and The Hunger Games have all released sequels, but none have managed to achieve the same success as their predecessors. Movie executives are slowly beginning to realize that relying solely on franchise movies or big budget blockbuster releases is no longer a sustainable strategy. Although many reasons have been posited for the drop in ticket sales, there is still hope for the movie industry. There are a number of highly anticipated releases slated for 2018, as well as new technology and technology upgrades in cinemas, giving moviegoers a more immersive experience. It may take a significant shift in the industry to regain the trust and interest of audiences, but it's not out of the realm of possibility. Overall, it's clear that the movie industry needs to focus on creating high-quality, original content that draws audiences back to the cinema. They need to address the concerns of younger audiences who are more interested in affordable streaming options. It's time for movie executives to find new and innovative ways for cinema to compete with those new ways of watching movies.
