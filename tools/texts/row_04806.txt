chatgpt: Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero has officially become the player with the best minutes-per-goal ratio in Premier League history, after scoring his 175th Premier League goal in just his 255th game. The Argentine striker's goal came during City's 3-1 victory over Liverpool on Sunday. The 26-year-old scored City's third goal in the 76th minute, after being set up by Raheem Sterling. With his latest goal, Aguero surpassed former Arsenal forward Thierry Henry, who scored 175 goals in 258 Premier League appearances, averaging a goal every 122 minutes played. In contrast, Aguero has scored an impressive 54 goals in just 113 minutes per goal, breaking the previous record set by Henry by a significant margin. Ever since his £38m transfer to Manchester City in 2011, Aguero has been a prolific scorer and has formed a key part of City's attacking line-up. He has won four Premier League titles, an FA Cup and five League Cups. Speaking about Aguero's achievement, City manager Pep Guardiola said: "He's a legend. He's a part of this club's history. What he has achieved is incredible. To break Thierry Henry's record is no small feat." The Premier League's official Twitter account also congratulated Aguero, saying: "Legendary status secured... Congratulations to Sergio Aguero, who now holds the record for the best minutes-per-goal ratio in Premier League history." Aguero's record-breaking goal came during a crucial win for City, who now sit four points behind league leaders Liverpool in the table. City had fallen behind to a first-half goal by Roberto Firmino, but goals from Sergio Aguero, Leroy Sane and Raheem Sterling secured an impressive comeback win for the champions. Aguero will now be looking to add to his impressive goal tally as City push for a third consecutive Premier League title. His current form suggests that he could be the difference between success and failure for Guardiola's side this season. There is no doubt that Aguero's latest achievement cements his place as one of the Premier League's greatest ever strikers. His clinical finishing, pace and ability to score from any angle have earned him a place in the hearts of City fans and the admiration of neutral football fans worldwide.
