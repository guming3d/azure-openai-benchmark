As anyone who has spent time in New york knows, residents are rarely shy of voicing their concerns and complaints about their city. A new map shows them in real time - revealing the mood of every neighborhood. Created by Microsoft, it uses data from the city's 311 service. Scroll through New York below to see the live mood of its neighbourhoods . The map is created from New York City’s 311 non-emergency data stream, which takes as its input New York residents’ emails, phone calls, and text messages sent to communicate issues to city authorities. Each day, HereHere pulls 311 data for each neighborhood and identifies the most compelling, important 311 request types, and the system generates cartoons and text that represent a neighborhood’s characterized reactions. Called HereHere, Microsoft said New York city was the obvious choice to launch the project. 'If any city can be called opinionated, it would be New York City, so it’s somehow inevitable that HereHere is making its debut in the Big Apple,' the firm said. Developed by Microsoft Research’s Future Social Experiences Labs (FUSE Labs), the project has taken a year to create. 'HereHere NYC introduces daily neighborhood engagement with a light touch,' Kati London, the project's lead, said. The map takes neighborhood-specific public data for 40 areas, and it enables the neighborhoods to communicate how they’re doing—expressed through text and cartoonlike icons. 'People can receive the information via a daily email digest, neighborhood-specific Twitter feeds, or status updates on an online map. 'We want to understand how it changes or impacts the way people relate to their community when they can interact with data in this way.'

The map has data from 40 areas, and is constantly updated with 311 call information . 'Think of it as a meta-status update for the day—a simplification of issues in your neighborhood compressed into a text that you might get from a friend,' London said. 'We’re giving a human voice to the neighborhood which, hopefully, will stimulate conversations about issues. 'We’re eager to get people using it and seeing how it impacts them,” London says. 'Will they continue to use it? Will it provoke conversations within the community or discussions across communities? The interface is mobile-friendly and it’s particularly easy for users to post or tweet what a neighborhood is saying today. 'Each neighborhood also has a Twitter account you can follow and tweet out.'

chatgpt: Microsoft has created a new map to showcase its cutting-edge data analysis service. The map is based on data gathered from complaints made to the 311 service, and it offers a glimpse into the potential power of Microsoft's data analysis tools. The 311 service is a platform used by residents of major cities to report non-emergency issues such as potholes, graffiti, and noise. The data collected by the service is incredibly valuable for city officials, as it offers insights into the needs and concerns of the residents they serve. Microsoft has taken this data and used it to create a compelling new map that visualizes the issues that matter most to the people of major cities. The map is available for New York City and allows users to explore the most common complaints lodged through the 311 system. Users can zoom in to specific neighborhoods to see which issues are most prevalent in particular areas. For example, users may discover that noise complaints are particularly high in certain neighborhoods, or that there are a significant number of potholes in a specific area of the city. The map is incredibly detailed, and it offers a compelling snapshot of the issues that matter most to the people of New York. Microsoft has suggested that versions of the map could be created for all major cities, allowing residents across the country to explore the issues that matter most to the people in their areas. This could be incredibly powerful, as it would allow city officials to gain insights into the needs and concerns of people across the country. By understanding what issues matter most to the people they serve, officials can make informed decisions about how to allocate resources and address the needs of their communities. The creation of this map is just one example of how data analysis tools like those offered by Microsoft can be used to drive real-world insights and improvements. By analyzing large datasets, companies like Microsoft are able to identify patterns and trends that would be difficult, if not impossible, for humans to uncover on their own. This allows them to offer powerful tools and services that can help businesses and governments make better decisions, ultimately leading to improved outcomes for the people they serve. Microsoft has been at the forefront of the data analysis revolution, offering insights and tools that have helped countless businesses and organizations achieve success. With the creation of this new map, Microsoft is once again demonstrating its commitment to using technology to make the world a better place. If the success of this map is any indication, we can expect to see many more exciting developments from Microsoft in the near future.
