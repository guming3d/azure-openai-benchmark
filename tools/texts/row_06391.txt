article: (CNN) -- Authorities have charged a teenage boy who said he planned to hijack a commercial jetliner in an attempt to commit suicide, an FBI spokesman told CNN late Thursday. The 16-year-old was taken into custody by airport police without incident on Tuesday evening after flying from Los Angeles, California, to Nashville, Tennessee, on Southwest Airlines Flight 284. "His stated intent was to hijack the airplane and commit suicide," said George Bolds, an FBI spokesman in Memphis, Tennessee. "He did indicate he intended to die in Louisiana. It appears he had a ticket to Louisiana." Bolds said the boy indicated he had lived in Louisiana. The teen wanted to crash the plane into a Hannah Montana concert in Lafayette, Louisiana, two CNN television affiliates in Nashville, WSMV and WTVF, reported, citing unnamed sources. The concert is scheduled for Friday night at the Lafayette Cajundome. Bolds said he had no information on whether the concert may have been targeted as part of the plot. In the teen's possession were handcuffs, duct tape and a type of rope or yarn, according to the FBI. Authorities noted that those are not prohibited items. "His plan contemplated overpowering the flight crew," Bolds said. The teen is being held on unspecified state charges and could face federal charges as well, Bolds said. CNN affiliate WTVF reported the teen has been charged with felony terrorism and is being held at the Davidson County juvenile detention center. "It is my understanding that at no point in time during the course of the flight there was ever any safety concern," Southwest Airlines spokesman Chris Mainz said. Bolds also said nothing threatening occurred on the flight from California to Nashville. It was not immediately clear how police became aware of the teen's presence on the flight or his alleged suicide plans. "Hannah Montana" is a hit Disney Channel show -- which stars 15-year-old Miley Cyrus and her country singer dad, Billy Ray Cyrus -- about a teenage girl who is a typical high-schooler by day but has a secret pop-star alter ego by night.

chatgpt: An unnamed teenager was reportedly targeting the Hannah Montana concert in Nashville, according to sources cited by news affiliates. The 16-year-old was arrested on Tuesday without incident on an L.A.-to-Nashville flight, after allegedly contemplating overpowering the flight crew, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) confirmed. The FBI has not yet released specific details about the incident but did indicate that the teenager was traveling alone on the flight. Authorities say the teen did not have a weapon, and passengers didn't appear to be in danger. However, the seriousness of the potential threat is currently under investigation. The Nashville concert was slated to take place at the Bridgestone Arena before it was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was rescheduled for November 23, 2021, nearly a year later. As the investigation into the teenager's motives continues, some have speculated that the suspect may have been hoping to wreak havoc at the concert venue. Alternatively, the teen may have been targeting the flight itself, with the intent of using it as a means of reaching the concert with harmful intentions. Regardless of the motivation behind the teenager's actions, the incident serves as a reminder of the importance of remaining vigilant when traveling. In recent years, there have been several high-profile cases of individuals attempting to carry out acts of terrorism or harm on airplanes. The FBI encourages anyone with information about the incident to come forward and contact their local FBI office. With the help of the public, law enforcement officials can work to keep travelers safe and secure in their journeys. It remains unclear what charges the teenager will face, but authorities have indicated that further details are forthcoming as the investigation progresses. Ultimately, the quick actions of law enforcement and the vigilance of those aboard the flight may have averted a potentially dangerous situation. As the world navigates the ongoing pandemic and broader threats to safety and security, it's more important than ever to remain vigilant and work together to ensure the safety of all travelers.
