chatgpt: Wonton Food, a New York-based fortune cookie manufacturer, has made a change to the messages inside their popular snacks. The company recently announced that they will be replacing their "saucy" and sometimes controversial messages with milder and more family-friendly alternatives.  The move comes after years of criticism from some customers who felt that the messages were inappropriate or offensive. While the messages were intended to be humorous or thought-provoking, some felt that they went too far and were not appropriate for all audiences.  According to a spokesperson for the company, the new messages will be more in line with the company's values of inclusivity and respect. "We want our cookies to bring joy and positivity to everyone who reads them, and we believe that these new messages will do just that," the spokesperson said.  The change has not been without controversy, however. Some fans of the company's fortune cookies have taken to social media to express their disappointment with the new direction. They argue that the edgy and irreverent messages were what made the cookies unique and memorable.  Despite the backlash, Wonton Food has decided to stick with their decision to change the messages. They believe that the new fortunes will appeal to a wider audience and help them to expand their business beyond their core demographic.  Wonton Food has been a fixture in the fortune cookie industry since 1973, and their products are sold in grocery stores and restaurants across the United States. The company has not disclosed what specific messages will be featured in the new cookies, but they have assured customers that the change will not affect the taste or quality of their product.  Only time will tell if this change will be a success for Wonton Food. For now, fans of the company's fortune cookies will have to wait and see what the future holds for their favorite snack.
