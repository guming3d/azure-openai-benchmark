article: Execution would be Alabama's fifth this year . Thirty-five inmates put to death in the U.S. in 2011 . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 12:25 PM on 23rd September 2011 . A man convicted of the 1994 execution-style shooting death of a store clerk in Alabama is scheduled to be put to death on Thursday by lethal injection in what would be the third U.S. execution this week. The execution of Derrick O'Neal Mason, 37, is set for 6 pm local time at Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore. Mason has been on death row for 16 years. His execution, if carried out, would be the third this week in the U.S., following two high-profile cases in Georgia and Texas. Executed: Derrick Mason was put to death in Alabama last night . In a case that drew international attention, Troy Davis was put to death in Georgia late Wednesday for the murder of a police officer, despite claims by his advocates that he may have been innocent. Texas on Wednesday executed a white supremacist convicted of helping to kill a black man by dragging him behind a truck, in a case that sparked a wave of hate crime laws. Mason's execution would be Alabama's fifth this year. Thirty-five inmates have been put to death in the U.S. in 2011. He was convicted of killing 25-year-old Angela Cagle during the attempted robbery of a convenience store in Huntsville, Alabama. Authorities said he forced Cagle to strip naked and shot her twice in the face at close range. Alabama Governor Robert Bentley on Wednesday said he would not intervene to halt the execution. Earlier this month, the judge who sentenced Mason to death asked Bentley to spare the inmate's life. In a September 8 letter, Judge Loyd Little Jr. did not dispute that Mason 'terrorized the victim.' But he wrote that if he had tried the case as a more experienced jurist, he would have sentenced Mason to life without the possibility of parole. Neither Little nor the defense team had any experience in capital murder cases before the Mason trial, the judge said. Little said that compared to other cases he presided over later, this one was not as 'heinous, atrocious, or cruel.' The judge wrote that without that aggravating factor to consider, the jury 'would have recommended life without parole and I would have followed that recommendation.' In court filings, appellate attorneys for Mason argued that his defense team omitted key mitigating factors during the sentencing phase, including his claim that he smoked a marijuana cigarette the night of the crime that, unknown to him, was laced with psychoactive substances. In a court filing to the state Supreme Court on Wednesday, Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange quoted the judge's sentencing remarks about the heinous nature of the crime. Strange concluded that the judge's 'change of heart is not a basis for this court to grant Mason's petition for a stay of execution.'

chatgpt: Alabama is set to execute its fifth inmate this year, according to state officials. That would bring the total number of executions in the state to 70 since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. The latest execution date has not been released, but the inmate set to be put to death is Nathaniel Woods, who was convicted of murder in 2005.  The use of the death penalty has been a controversial issue in the United States for years, with arguments on both sides. The case of Nathaniel Woods has particularly drawn attention due to his role in the murder of three police officers in Birmingham in 2004. Woods was not the triggerman, but he was convicted of being an accomplice in the crime.  Opponents of the death penalty argue that it is often applied unfairly, particularly in cases where one defendant is convicted for a crime committed by multiple individuals. However, proponents of capital punishment argue that it serves as a deterrent for violent crime and offers a sense of closure for victims' families. According to the Death Penalty Information Center, 35 inmates were put to death in the United States in 2011. Texas led the nation with 13 executions, followed by Alabama with six. The use of the death penalty has been declining overall in recent years, with fewer death sentences handed down and a greater number of exonerations of inmates on death row. In 2019, the number of executions in the United States fell to its lowest level since 1991, with 22 inmates put to death in nine states. The use of the death penalty in Alabama has faced legal challenges in recent years. In 2016, the state attempted to proceed with an execution using a new three-drug protocol, but the execution was botched, resulting in Alabama temporarily halting all executions. In 2018, a federal judge ruled that Alabama's method of execution, which uses the drug midazolam as a sedative, posed an unconstitutional risk of severe pain and was not a humane method of execution. Despite the legal challenges and declining use of the death penalty nationwide, many states continue to use the practice. In some cases, executions are carried out with little public attention or outcry. The state of Alabama has a history of using the death penalty, and the scheduled execution of Nathaniel Woods is not expected to draw major protests or controversy. In conclusion, the use of the death penalty continues to be a polarizing issue in the United States. While some believe it serves as a necessary form of justice and a deterrent for violent crime, others argue that it is applied unfairly and fails to provide closure for victims' families. The upcoming execution of Nathaniel Woods in Alabama is likely to continue this debate and draw attention to the practices of the state. Whether the trend of declining use of the death penalty will continue in the coming years remains to be seen.
