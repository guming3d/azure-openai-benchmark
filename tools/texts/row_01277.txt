chatgpt: On Monday, a 2-week-old baby was attacked by a pet raccoon in Elgin, Texas. The incident caused lacerations to the baby's face, and he had to be treated in the hospital. The mother, Brittany Darby, is now facing charges of child endangerment or abandonment. According to the police report, two pet raccoons were kept by Darby in the residence where the attack occurred. The animals were euthanized at the scene of the incident as they posed a threat to public safety. It is unclear if the raccoons were provoked before the attack. In Texas, it is illegal to keep raccoons as pets without a permit. Darby may face additional charges for not following the state law. The authorities are investigating how she obtained the two raccoons and if any other dangerous wild animals were kept in her residence. Neighbors in the area expressed their shock and concern after the attack. One neighbor stated that they had never seen any animals in Darby's yard before.
