article: (CNN)The Centers for Disease Control is raising a red flag that a potentially deadly bacteria may be lurking in your doctor's office. The bacteria, C. difficile, is typically found in hospitals, but a study out Wednesday reports a substantial number of people contracted the bug who hadn't been in a hospital, but had recently visited the doctor or dentist. The bacteria can cause deadly diarrhea, according to the CDC, with infections on the rise. The new report shows nearly half a million Americans infected in various locations in one year, with 15,000 deaths directly attributed to C. diff. In a 2013 study, researchers found C. diff present in six out of seven outpatient clinics tested in Ohio, including on patients' chairs and examining tables. The CDC is so concerned that they're starting a new study to try to assess nationally whether people are getting C. diff in doctors' offices. "This is really an important issue. We need to understand better how people are getting C. diff," said Dr. Cliff McDonald, a medical epidemiologist at the CDC. In the meantime, patients should wash their hands after visiting the doctor's office -- with soap and water, because alcohol-based gels don't get rid of C.diff. Another tip: Question your doctor whenever you're prescribed an antibiotic. Powerful broad-spectrum antibiotics wipe away good bacteria in your gut that fight off the bad bacteria, which leads the way to C. diff. Johns Hopkins safety expert Dr. Peter Pronovost recommends asking your doctor if you really need an antibiotic, if there's a less powerful one that will treat your infection, and if you're being prescribed the antibiotic for the shortest time possible. The CDC study, published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, said 150,000 people who had not been in the hospital came down with C. diff in 2011. Of those, 82% had visited a doctor's or dentist's office in the 12 weeks before their diagnosis. The CDC is hoping its new study will help determine cause and effect, because it's possible the patients had C. diff to begin with and went to the doctor to get help. It's also possible that antibiotics prescribed during the doctor's visit, and not microbes at the doctor's office, caused the infection. CNN's Sandee LaMotte contributed to this report .

chatgpt: A new study has shown a direct link between doctor and dentist visits and the spread of C. difficile, a bacterium that can cause severe and potentially fatal diarrhea. Although C. difficile is commonly found in hospitals, the study revealed that it is increasingly appearing in areas where patients receive medical care outside of a hospital setting. The study, which was conducted by the University of Michigan, suggests that the spread of C. difficile may be facilitated by patients who have recently taken antibiotics. Antibiotics can upset the natural balance of bacteria in the gut, allowing C. difficile to multiply and cause infection. Additionally, the study indicates that the use of proton pump inhibitors and histamine-2 receptor antagonists, commonly used to treat acid reflux and heartburn, may also increase a patient's risk of contracting C. difficile. Since the CDC first began tracking infections in 2000, cases of C. difficile have skyrocketed. In 2017, there were 223,900 reported cases of C. difficile in the United States alone. Approximately 12,800 of these cases were fatal. The CDC states that patients over the age of 65, or those with weakened immune systems, are particularly susceptible to infection. The rise of C. difficile infections is a cause for concern for healthcare workers and patients alike. Symptoms can range from mild diarrhea to life-threatening inflammation of the colon. Treatment often involves a course of antibiotics, but in severe cases, surgery may be required to remove the infected portion of the colon. The study's lead author, Dr. Stacy Holzbauer, emphasized the importance of preventative measures, including proper hand hygiene and minimizing the unnecessary use of antibiotics. "We need to make sure that we're using antibiotics appropriately, only when necessary and stopping them when they're no longer needed," Holzbauer stated. Holzbauer also encouraged healthcare providers to consider the possibility of C. difficile infection when patients exhibit symptoms such as persistent diarrhea or fever after a recent visit to a physician or dentist. Early detection can help prevent the spread of the infection and allow for quicker treatment. In light of the study's findings, medical professionals are emphasizing the importance of maintaining good health and hygiene practices, both at home and in healthcare settings. Hand washing and careful antibiotic use can go a long way in preventing the spread of C. difficile, and patients are encouraged to speak with their healthcare providers if they have concerns or questions.
