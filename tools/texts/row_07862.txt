article: Gloucester ruined Exeter’s centenary celebrations as they edged their West Country rivals at Sandy Park. It was the 100th game in the Premiership for the Devon club against the side who they defeated on their first game in rugby’s top flight back in 2010. The usually reliable boot of Gareth Steenson was most culpable. The Chiefs fly-half gifted the visitors a crucial try when Exeter were on top in the second half. The Ulsterman’s misjudged kick from his own line was charged down by Tom Savage. It came two minutes after Chiefs had snatched the initiative with two tries in two minutes by wingers Jack Nowell and Matt Jess. Gareth Steenson's usually reliable boot let him down on Saturday as Exeter lost to Gloucester by one point . Steenson also failed with a vital conversion after Thomas Waldrom had crashed over with nine minutes left. His kick would have given the Chiefs a one-point lead late on, but his attempt came back off the left post. Exeter were the better team in the first half, but were unable to convert pressure into points. Two penalties from Greig Laidlaw were the only scores of a lacklustre half. What was a fluctuating game fortunately sparked up in the second half. First England centre Billy Twelvetrees stroked home a superb drop kick from 45 metres to put Gloucester 9-0 ahead. Gloucester's Darren Dawiduik attempts to bust through the tackle of Exeter's Moray Low and Jack Yeandle . Then, Nowell gave England team-mate Ben Morgan the slip in the 49th minute to score the first try of the game, which was quickly followed by a 80-metre dash from Jess to the line after he gobbled up a wayward pass from Twelvetrees. Steenson converted both tries to put Chiefs 14-9 ahead. But after Steenson’s error let in Savage, Laidlaw converted to give Gloucester a narrow lead. Steenson and Laidlaw exchanged penalties before Ben Morgan crashed over to gain breathing space. Chiefs' Jack Nowell makes the break that leads to his try but Gloucester held on for victory . Waldrom’s try looked to have given Exeter the final say, but Steenson’s conversion effort was marginally off target and Gloucester held on. Gloucester director of rugby David Humphreys was delighted with his side’s efforts. ‘Today was all about the result,’ he said. ‘I thought we showed a huge amount of character and spirit.’ Chiefs head coach Rob Baxter bemoaned his side’s errors as they lost for only the second time at home this season. ‘What’s hurt us is the fact we didn’t convert some of the opportunities. But what hurt us more is some silly play.’ Nowell dives over for the Chiefs' first try in their one-point defeat by Gloucester at Sandy Park .

chatgpt: In a thrilling clash at Sandy Park, hosts Exeter Chiefs lost their unbeaten start to the Premiership season as Gloucester emerged as winners by 17-19. The visitors were helped on their way by tries from Tom Savage and Ben Morgan, while Exeter's tries came from Jack Nowell and Thomas Waldrom. However, Chiefs kicker Gareth Steenson's missed conversion proved crucial, as it prevented the home side from salvaging a draw. The match started with the Chiefs asserting their dominance, as they opened up a 6-0 lead through two penalties from the always-reliable Steenson. However, Gloucester responded just before half-time, as Savage powered over from close range. In the second half, both teams came out firing, looking to put their mark on the game. It was Gloucester who struck first, as Morgan finished off a sweeping move that started deep in their own half. Billy Twelvetrees missed the conversion, leaving the score at 6-12. However, their advantage was short-lived, as Nowell showed his pace and power to score in the corner for the Chiefs. Steenson had the chance to level the scores, but his conversion attempt drifted wide of the posts. Gloucester then hit back with a penalty from Twelvetrees, but Exeter responded almost immediately as Waldrom crashed over from a driving maul. Steenson had the chance to put his side in front with the conversion, but his kick hit the post and bounced out. The final few minutes of the match were tense, with both sides looking to snatch victory. However, it was Gloucester who held on for a famous victory, much to the delight of their travelling fans. Speaking after the match, Gloucester coach Johan Ackermann hailed his side's character and resilience. "To come to a place like this and beat a team as good as Exeter is a fantastic achievement," he said. "We knew it would be tough, but the boys stuck to their game plan and showed great composure in the crucial moments." Meanwhile, Exeter coach Rob Baxter was left to rue his team's missed chances. "We had plenty of opportunities to win the game, but we just couldn't take them," he said. "Credit to Gloucester, they defended really well and made it tough for us. We'll have to learn from this and come back stronger next week." The result sees Gloucester move up to fourth in the table, while Exeter drop to second, behind Saracens. Both teams will be looking to bounce back when the Premiership returns after a short break for European action.
