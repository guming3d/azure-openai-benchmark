article: Your iPhone guzzles more energy than your refrigerator. iPhones burn through significantly more energy than a new mid-sized refrigerator, according to a new study. The average new mid-sized refrigerator uses about 322 kilowatt hours a year while your iPhone uses about 361 kilowatt hours annually. The majority of that energy isn’t used to charge your battery, it’s used to power data centers responsible for the wireless connections and data streaming that bring your device to life. This revelation was made in ‘The Cloud Begins with Coal: Big Data, Big networks, Big Infrastructure and Big Power,’ a paper published by the technology investment advisory Digital Power Group. Energy guzzler: A customer shows her new iPhone 5 at the Apple store in Hong Kong . The world’s communications systems use 1,500 terawatt hours – 10 per cent of global energy and as much as Germany and Japan combined, according to the paper. The usage is equal to total global electricity usage in 1985. Just one terawatt hour is enough to power roughly 90,000 homes for an entire year. With more and more devices being ‘smart’ or ‘connected’ each day, hourly internet traffic is expected to exceed annual internet traffic in the year 2000, the paper says. A lot of energy is needed to power the world’s communications backbone, and a lot more is going to be needed in the future as more and more server farms are fired up to stream Netflix to whatever is in your pocket, backpack or purse. More efficient than an iPhone: This refrigerator uses less energy than an iPhone . By 2035, only slightly less energy will be needed to power ‘the cloud’ than for lights, the paper estimates. It takes more energy to stream a few episodes of Breaking Bad to your iPhone than it does to stamp them onto a DVD and ship them to you, according to the paper. One of the world’s largest consumers of cloud data, not surprisingly, is Apple, and it takes a lot of juice to handle all those iPhones and iPads. Unfortunately, the bulk of this energy comes from coal, over 55 percent in Apple’s case, according to Greenpeace. The SUV of phones: iPhones use more energy than refrigerators . ‘Coal’s dominance arises from the importance of keeping costs down while providing ever-greater quantities of energy to the growing economies, and as the IEA recently noted, the absence of cost-effective alternatives at the scales the world needs,’ says the paper. As long as coal continues to be the world’s cheapest source of energy, it likely will also be the most used, further contributing to global warming. Since global data usage isn’t going to drop, Apple might have the answer. Apple is working towards using 100 per cent renewable energy, and is already 75 per cent of the way there, according to its website. Using solar, wind, hydroelectric and geothermal power sources, Apple has its sights on becoming as close to carbon neutral as possible – other companies should take note.
highlights: The majority of the energy is used for cloud services, not charging the iPhone . The majority of the energy used to power the cloud comes from coal . In the next two decades, servers will require almost as much energy as lights .

chatgpt: Cloud services have become an integral part of our daily lives, from streaming music to storing files. With the increasing demand for cloud services, the amount of energy required to power these services has also risen significantly. According to a recent report, the majority of the energy used to power the cloud comes from coal, a non-renewable resource that is not environmentally friendly. The report findings indicate that a significant amount of energy is used to power cloud services, while a minimal amount of energy is used to charge the iPhone. It is surprising to note that the energy required to power the cloud is almost ten times more than the energy used to charge an iPhone. This highlights the significant impact cloud services have on energy consumption. Furthermore, the report states that in the next two decades, servers used to power the cloud will require almost as much energy as lights. This highlights the importance of reducing energy consumption in cloud services to prevent adverse effects on the environment.  The report's findings raise concerns about the carbon footprint of cloud services, as the majority of the energy used to power them is generated from coal. Coal is a non-renewable resource that is the primary source of greenhouse gas emissions. The increased use of coal to power cloud services could significantly contribute to climate change. To mitigate this impending problem, there are alternatives to reduce energy consumption in cloud services, including using renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power. The implementation of such sources of energy production could significantly reduce the carbon footprint of cloud services. Renewable energy sources are sustainable and environmentally friendly, reducing the adverse effects of non-renewable resources such as coal. Furthermore, the implementation of renewable energy sources will contribute to achieving national and international sustainability goals, further emphasizing their importance. Cloud service providers must take action to reduce energy consumption levels and minimize the impact on the environment. Initiatives such as energy-efficient servers and the implementation of renewable energy sources can significantly contribute to addressing the energy consumption concern. In conclusion, the report highlights the significant impact of cloud services on energy consumption, with the majority of energy consumed coming from non-renewable sources such as coal. While it is essential to continue using cloud services, initiatives to reduce energy consumption levels are necessary to mitigate adverse environmental effects. Cloud service providers should prioritize sustainable practices to ensure future generations inherit a cleaner and sustainable world.
