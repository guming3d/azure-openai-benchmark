Amanda McGorian claimed she had a gun and demanded cash from two women workers at the Spar on Chester Road in Sunderland . She returned 15 minutes later and asked officers at the scene: 'Can I just get my phone and say sorry to the lasses.' McGorian, of Penshaw, was arrested and admitted robbery. Judge James Goss QC told her: 'Not only did you cause considerable fear to the young girls who were looking after that shop, performing a public service, but you did your level best to get yourself locked up by doing that. 'You didn’t have a gun but they weren’t to know that and you can imagine they would be frightened by you making that threat in the circumstances. 'It was a drunken, stupid criminal act on your part and I hope you realise that now.' The court heard one of the workers, who was 21, had been employed at the store for just two weeks when McGorian went in an and demanded cash. But Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) heard the 27-year-old dropped her mobile phone while escaping with money from the till during the raid on September 29 . After making repeated requests for money, McGorian said: 'Do I have to get my f****** gun out.' Prosecutor John Brennan told the court: 'That changed the whole atmosphere and they were frightened whether she had a weapon or not.' The newly hired worker said she was unsure if she could ever go back to work in the shop and said she had burst into tears after the raid. Christopher Rose, defending, said alcohol is at the root of McGorian’s problems. Mr Rose said: 'She needs some supervision. 'She realises the need to change.' McGorian was sentenced to eight months behind bars, suspended for two years, with supervision, alcohol treatment programme requirement and a three month night time curfew. The judge told her: 'You have been given a chance. You won't get another chance.'

chatgpt: Amanda McGorian was arrested and charged with robbery after allegedly holding up a store in Penshaw, claiming to have a weapon and making off with cash from the till. However, the 27-year-old's scheme quickly unravelled as she dropped her mobile phone while trying to escape with the stolen money. Store employees alerted the authorities after the incident, and police quickly arrived on the scene. Realizing that she had lost her phone, Amanda returned to the store just 15 minutes after the robbery and asked officers if they had recovered it. However, instead of getting her phone back, she was immediately apprehended by the police and taken into custody. In her statement to the police, McGorian admitted to the robbery and was subsequently charged with the offence. She appeared before magistrates at South Tyneside Magistrates' Court later that day, where she pleaded guilty to the crime. During the hearing, it was revealed that the stolen money amounted to approximately £420. In addition, the court heard that McGorian had a history of alcohol and drug abuse and that she had been struggling with addiction for some time. Despite her plea, the court heard that McGorian was no stranger to criminal activity. In fact, she had previously been convicted of several offences, including shoplifting and assault. In light of her previous criminal record, the judge handling the case decided to sentence McGorian to two years in prison. In addition, the judge expressed concern about the defendant's drug and alcohol abuse and recommended that she seek treatment for her addiction while incarcerated. This latest incident serves as a reminder of the dangers of resorting to criminal means to meet one's financial needs. While the circumstances surrounding McGorian's actions remain unclear, it is clear that she will now face serious consequences for her actions. The incident also highlights the importance of shopkeepers and employees being vigilant and contacting the authorities in case of any suspicious or criminal activity in their stores.
