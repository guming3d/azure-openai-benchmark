This incredible feat comes just 11 weeks after she was paralyzed from the waist down in an ATV accident. Using the latest in bionic technology, Van Dyken-Rouen was able to take her first steps since the accident. The technology, which has been years in the making, uses robotic legs to simulate the movements of walking. The bionic legs are controlled by a computer and allow the wearer to stand, walk, and even climb stairs. "I never thought I would walk again," said Van Dyken-Rouen. "It's an amazing feeling to be standing up and moving around again." The accident, which occurred on June 6, left Van Dyken-Rouen with a broken back and severed spinal cord. She underwent surgery the next day and was transferred to a rehabilitation center. For the past few months, she has been undergoing intensive therapy in an effort to regain as much mobility as possible. "I've been working hard every day," said Van Dyken-Rouen. "I refused to let this accident defeat me." The bionic legs that Van Dyken-Rouen used to walk are still in the testing phase, but they show great promise for those who have suffered from spinal cord injuries. In addition to their obvious physical benefits, the legs also provide a psychological boost to those who use them. For Van Dyken-Rouen, being able to stand and walk again is a sign of hope and a step towards recovery. "This is just the beginning," said Van Dyken-Rouen. "I'll continue to work hard and push myself to do more." Van Dyken-Rouen's courageous spirit and determination have made her an inspiration to many. Her journey to walk again has been a long one, but she has refused to give up. With the help of technology and her own indomitable spirit, she has taken her first steps towards a brighter future.
