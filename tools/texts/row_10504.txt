Ted Terry, 59, had been accused of headbutting Amarjit Talafair and calling him a ‘f****** P***’ after a drunken row over a cigarette. Speaking outside court Terry said he felt 'relieved' at the verdict. The court heard that Terry and two friends got into a confrontation over a cigarette with Mr Talafair and his friends outside The Windsor pub near Fenchurch Street station on March 22 last year. Both groups had been drinking in the pub to celebrate birthdays, the court heard. Giving evidence, Terry admitted putting his face against Mr Talafair's and calling him a 'f***** tight p****', but denied headbutting him or saying 'f****** Paki, let's have it right here and now'. The father of two and grandfather of six told the jury: 'I just said 'F*** off, go back downstairs', things like that. It wasn't no racist stuff.' Mr Talafair told the jury that he had suffered no injury from Terry's headbutt because he was able to get out of the way in time. He admitted calling Terry a 'fat bald p****' during the stand-off. The alleged victim reported the incident to police the following day after researching Terry online. He asked officers about taking his story to the press, but was told it would hamper the investigation, the court heard. Thumbs up: Ted Terry shows his relief after being cleared at the Old Bailey .

chatgpt: Ted Terry, the 59-year-old father of Chelsea Football Club legend John Terry, has been cleared at the Old Bailey of charges that he racially abused and headbutted Amarjit Talafair. The case brought against Terry has been widely publicized and was watched closely by not only the media, but by members of the community as well. The alleged incident took place last year in March, resulting in Terry being charged with a racially aggravated public order offense and assault by beating. Throughout the trial, which lasted for several weeks, both parties presented evidence to support their claims. Witnesses were called, videos were shown, and statements were made. Eventually, the jury delivered a verdict in Terry's favor, finding him not guilty on all counts. Outside of the courthouse, Terry spoke to reporters, expressing his relief and gratitude for the outcome of the case. He said that this has been a difficult time for him and his family, and he is happy to finally be able to put this behind him. "I am just very relieved that the jury has decided that I am innocent. This has been a very stressful time for me and my family, and I am glad that it is finally over," Terry said. Terry also mentioned that he was going to call his son John to share the news with him. John Terry is a well-known player in the Premier League, having spent most of his career with Chelsea Football Club. He has been supportive of his father throughout the trial, attending several hearings and sitting in the public gallery during the proceedings. "I am going home to call my son now and tell him the news. He has been very supportive throughout this entire ordeal, and I can't thank him enough," Terry said. The trial was not without its controversies, as the defense and prosecution clashed over several issues. One of the main points of contention was the use of racial slurs, which the prosecution alleged were used by Terry during the incident. The defense argued that there was no evidence to support these claims and that the accusations were baseless. Despite these issues, the jury ultimately decided that there was not enough evidence to convict Terry of the charges brought against him. This has been seen as a victory for the defense and for Terry himself, who has maintained his innocence throughout the trial. The case has been widely covered by the media, and many people have expressed their opinions on the verdict. Some have criticized the decision, arguing that justice has not been served. Others have praised the outcome, saying that Terry was wrongly accused and that the truth has finally been revealed. Regardless of the opinions expressed, the fact remains that Ted Terry has been cleared of all charges and is now able to move on with his life. After a lengthy trial and months of scrutiny, he can finally breathe a sigh of relief and look forward to the future.
