Ackerman testified that Jackson was paying a staggering $30 million annually in interest alone on debts that totaled approximately half a billion dollars at the time of his death.

Ackerman's extensive analysis of Jackson's financial records revealed that despite earning millions through his music career, Jackson's lavish spending habits continuously put him in debt. According to Ackerman's analysis, Jackson spent money on numerous expenses, including donations to charity, gifts, travel, artwork, jewelry, and furniture.
