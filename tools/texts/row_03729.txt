By . Eleanor Harding . The secret of why the Queen never looks anything other than cool and immaculate has been revealed – Her Majesty does not perspire. According to royal dress designer Stewart Parvin, she is generally a 'cold person' – in terms of body temperature. He explained that the coolness of her skin keeps the clothes perfectly pressed – accounting for her impeccable appearance at all times. No glow:  The queen does not sweat, according to her dress designer Stewart Parvin . Standing out:  The queen will often wear bright colours in order to help her visible among a crowd . It was one of a number of the Queen’s wardrobe secrets revealed by 45-year-old Mr Parvin, who designs her outfits for official occasions. ‘We always choose fabrics that don’t crease – we go to extra lengths to line them so they don’t,’ he said. 'I am somebody who creases all their clothes. I’m always hot. The Queen is very lucky – she doesn’t crease her clothes. ‘The clothes are always impeccable. But it is also that she doesn’t glow. If you are a cold person your clothes don’t crease.’ Mr Parvin, who has been working with the Queen since 2000, described the techniques his team use to keep her looking perfect. As one of Her Majesty’s shoulders is higher than the other, she wears an extra shoulder-pad. Eye for design:  Stewart Parvin has been the Queen's dress designer for the past 11 years . Comfort:  The Queen has a servant wear her shoes in before she puts them on, according to Mr Parvin . And a servant with the same sized feet usually wears her shoes in for her to save her toes from blistering. Mr Parvin told the Sunday Times: ‘[The shoes] have to be immediately comfortable … she does get someone to wear them. The Queen can never say, “I’m uncomfortable, I can’t walk any more”.’ To ensure that no outfit appears in public too many times, or in the same company, each dress is recorded on a spread sheet with the time and date it was worn. The Queen is apparently keen to adopt ‘outrageous designs and bright colours’ such as pink and yellow, Mr Parvin said. He added that block colours ‘elongate her; she’s only very tiny’. For Her Majesty, practicality always comes first – which is why she favours dresses rather than skirts and blouses which can become untucked. Mr Parvin added: ‘There is always someone there photographing her. So when she gets out of a car, she can’t pull her skirt up, tuck her shirt in, tighten her things; she gets out and she’s ready.’
