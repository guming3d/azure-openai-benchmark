article: (CNN)  -- Brendon Pelser said he saw pure terror in the faces of his fellow passengers after an engine fell from a wing as it took off from Cape Town, South Africa, Wednesday. Men were sweating profusely, women were crying. "There was fear on their faces," Pelser said. "Everyone started panicking." But the pilot of Nationwide Airlines' Boeing 737 Flight CE723 was able to fly long enough to dump fuel and make an emergency landing at Cape Town International Airport. Including crew, 100 hundred people were on the plane that departed at 3:50 p.m. on an hourlong flight to Johannesburg, South Africa. No one was injured. The jet had only been in the air about 10 minutes before the engine fell. "We heard something crash and bang, the plane veering left and right. A person on the right side said the engine was missing -- had broken clean off," said Pelser.  Watch Pelser describe how the flight crew told passengers to "prepare for the worst" Â» . "They flew us in very slowly. We were all prepared for the worst. We went into the fetal position, head between the legs," he said. "Then we hit the runway." "I did kind of pray. I didn't want to die. I'm not really ready to die," the 33-year-old said. An object had been sucked into the engine as the nose wheel lifted from the ground and officials are trying to identify it. The engine-to-wing supporting structure is designed to release an engine "when extreme forces are applied," to prevent structural damage to the wing, Nationwide said on its Web site. The airline described the incident as a "catastrophic engine failure." As the nose wheel lifted from the ground, "the captain heard a loud noise immediately followed by a yaw of the aircraft (sideways slippage) to the right," the airline said in a news release. The flight instruments showed the No. 2 engine on the right side had failed, it said. Pelser said he spent the night in Cape Town, then flew back to Johannesburg where he lives, on the same airline. Nationwide said the engine had undergone a major overhaul in March 2005 at "an approved Federal Aviation Authority facility in the U.S.A." and had flown only 3,806 hours since then. "These engines typically achieve 10,000 hours between major overhauls," Nationwide Airlines' press release stated. E-mail to a friend .

chatgpt: A Nationwide Airlines plane made an emergency landing on Wednesday after an object was sucked into the engine during takeoff. The pilot was forced to dump fuel in order to make a safe landing. The incident occurred shortly after the nose wheel lifted from the ground, with 100 people on board, including crew. According to a passenger who was on board, the incident caused widespread panic. "Everyone started panicking," the passenger said. "It was a scary situation. We were all just hoping that we would make it out alive." The pilot quickly assessed the situation and made the decision to dump fuel in order to reduce the weight of the aircraft and prevent a potential explosion upon landing. The crew and passengers were shaken but unharmed as the plane landed safely. A spokesperson for Nationwide Airlines confirmed the incident in a statement released shortly after the incident. "We can confirm that a Nationwide Airlines flight experienced an issue during takeoff that required the pilot to make an emergency landing," the statement read. "All passengers and crew are safe, and we are cooperating fully with authorities to investigate the incident." The incident highlights the importance of emergency preparedness and the quick thinking of airline pilots in potentially hazardous situations. Airline crews undergo rigorous training to be able to handle emergencies, and in this case, the pilot's quick decision-making helped prevent a potentially catastrophic situation. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) officials are investigating the incident to determine the cause and to ensure that proper protocols were followed by the airline and its crew. It is not yet clear what caused the object to be sucked into the engine during takeoff. Nationwide Airlines has not yet released a statement regarding how it plans to address the concerns and questions raised by passengers and officials following the incident. The airline has a responsibility to ensure that its aircraft are safe and that the crew and passengers are able to travel without fear of harm. As the investigation continues, it is important for travelers to remain vigilant and aware of their surroundings while traveling. While incidents such as the one that occurred on Wednesday are rare, they serve as a reminder of the importance of preparedness and quick thinking in potentially hazardous situations.
