Gruesome tail: Mohammed Ali, 37, found a mouse in his deep-fried scampi - only after he had removed it from the deep fat fryer. Supermarket chain Tesco and West Lothian council have both launched an investigation . Floored: Mohammed Ali, a plumber from Stoneyburn, West Lothian, saw it as he sat down for his dinner . Mr Ali, from Stoneyburn, West Lothian, said he is still too sick to eat after finding the rodent on Wednesday and can only drink juice. 'I stuck my hand in the bag and and put it in - I was in a hurry,' he said. Two minutes later, he added: 'I saw something black was inside it. 'I thought "what the hell is that?" I fished it out and it was a mouse. I was shocked. 'I was upset and angry. I was looking forward to scampi and I love scampi.' The plumber has since been teased by his family. He said: 'I went to my brother’s party later that day and as soon as I got in my brother was going, ‘Squeak!

Unappetising: The rodent which Mr Ali accidentally deep-fried for dinner with a packet of breaded fish . After making the gruesome find he contacted Tesco and West Lothian Council, who are both investigating. Trading standards officers visited him yesterday. A council spokesman said: 'We have been contacted by a local resident regarding the alleged find of a mouse in a locally bought food product.' A Tesco spokesman added: 'We set ourselves very high standards for the safety and quality of our food. 'The product has not been returned to store by Mr Ali but we will be assisting the local authority with any investigation they may undertake.' If the probe supports Mr Ali's allegations, he will not have been the first to find a rodent in his food. In 2010 Stephen Forse, from Kidlington, Oxfordshire, was horrified to find a mouse baked into a Hovis Best of Both loaf which he had bought from Tesco. He made the gruesome discovery as he was preparing sandwiches for his children. The find led to producers Premier Foods being fined £5,500 and ordered to pay costs of more than £11,000.

chatgpt: In a bizarre incident that has grabbed many people's attention, a man was left floored after he put Tesco scampi in a deep-fat fryer. Mohammed Ali, a 37-year-old from Bathgate, West Lothian, had purchased a £3 packet of Tesco scampi but was in a hurry to prepare it. Failing to read the instructions on how to cook it properly, he decided to put it in the deep-fat fryer instead.  The results were disastrous as the scampi started to burn and caused a small fire in Mohammed Ali's kitchen. Fortunately, he managed to put out the fire before anyone was injured. However, the experience left him shaken and he complained to Tesco about the incident.  The supermarket chain responded promptly, apologising for the incident and acknowledging that the scampi should not have been prepared in this way. They also clarified their cooking instructions for the product and advised customers to follow them carefully to avoid any mishaps. The incident has caught the attention of the West Lothian council, which is now investigating the matter. A spokesperson for the council said that they take food safety very seriously and would be conducting an investigation to establish if any rules or regulations had been breached.  The incident has also sparked a debate on social media about the dangers of not following food preparation instructions. Many users shared their own experiences of mishaps in the kitchen and emphasised the importance of understanding how to prepare food safely. While the incident may seem humorous at first, it highlights the potential risks of not following cooking instructions, and the importance of proper food safety. It is imperative that customers read and understand cooking instructions properly to ensure they do not put themselves or others at risk. The incident has also highlighted the responsibilities that supermarkets have in ensuring that their products are safe when used as intended. Tesco is not alone in having to deal with such incidents. In 2019, Asda faced criticism after a customer reported that their mince pies had caught fire in the oven. As a response, Asda issued a recall for the products and investigated the matter thoroughly. The Mohammed Ali incident serves as a reminder that in our busy lives, it is crucial to take the time to read and understand cooking instructions. It also highlights the need for supermarkets to ensure that their products are safe for customers to use. The investigation by the council will hopefully clarify if any rules were indeed breached and serve as a warning to anyone who may not take cooking instructions seriously in the future.
