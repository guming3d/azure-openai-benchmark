article: (CNN) -- There has been no change in NBA players' position in the face of an ultimatum from the owners as the two sides try to reach a collective bargaining agreement, the president of the players' association said Tuesday. "There isn't any player that wants us to take a bad deal," Derek Fisher said. The league on Sunday gave the players' association until Wednesday afternoon to accept a deal after eight hours of meetings over the weekend. Fisher said Sunday that the offer was not acceptable, and he reiterated Tuesday that the players' association is holding firm. "That doesn't mean we won't continue to negotiate," Fisher said at a news conference after a meeting of players representing all but one of the NBA's teams. NBA Commissioner David Stern has said the newest proposal gives players between 49% and 51% of revenues. If the players' association does not change its mind by Wednesday, the NBA will offer up another proposal -- one that offers players 47% of basketball revenues. The current proposal says that if the league exceeds certain revenue forecasts, the players would receive 51%. If it didn't, the share would fall to 49%. But Fisher said Sunday that "there'd be no way in the world we'd ever get to 51%" under the provisions. The players' association's executive director, Billy Hunter, told CNN sister network TBS that Tuesday's meeting was intended to spell out the details of the owners' proposal, which they were "misunderstanding" based on media reports that focused on the revenue sharing offer. Once they heard the details of the proposal, he said, "they were all horrified by it." He said it would "decimate" gains made by players in recent years. Hunter said he is likely to meet with Stern before the owners' deadline Wednesday to see if there was any movement in their position. Fisher, during the news conference, said the players are confident an agreement giving players a better deal would still be possible despite the owners' ultimatum. The NBA season has been canceled through at least November 30, and the two sides are hoping they can reach a resolution before more games are called off. Stern has said the 2010-2011 season was not profitable for most of the league's 30 owners, who want cost-cutting help from players. The league lost as much as $300 million last season, according to Stern. One of the battles has focused on the owners' rejection of calls by the players' union for an average $7 million player salary in the sixth year of a new labor deal. The current average salary is about $5 million. Other big issues include a fight over a move by owners to gain the bigger share of revenues and whether the NBA will strengthen its salary cap. The league's owners began a lockout of players in early July.

chatgpt: NBA players' president Derek Fisher addressed the media on Tuesday after meeting with player representatives to discuss the latest offer from the league's owners. The meeting was held to explain the details of the offer and to determine whether players would accept it. Fisher stated that there isn't any player that wants the union to take a bad deal. The player representatives worked hard to go over every aspect of the proposal to ensure that it was in the best interest of the players. The union's role is to look out for the players' best interests, and to ensure that they receive a fair deal. The owners have set a deadline of Wednesday for the players to accept their latest proposal. If the players reject the offer, the owners could cancel the rest of the season. It is a high-pressure situation for both sides, but the players are taking their time to make the right decision. The main sticking point is the revenue split between the owners and players. The players' union wants a higher share of revenue, while the owners are looking to reduce costs. The NBA has already lost millions of dollars due to the pandemic, and the owners are looking to make up the lost revenue. Fisher acknowledged that the players recognize the financial position of the league, but they also want to ensure that they receive a fair deal. The players are willing to negotiate, but they aren't going to accept a deal that doesn't work for them. The NBA lockout has been going on for months, and fans are getting restless. Many are waiting for the league to resume, but there's no clear end in sight. The lockout affects not only the players and owners but also arena workers, businesses that rely on game-day revenue, and fans. The league has already canceled hundreds of games, and if a resolution isn't reached soon, the entire season could be in jeopardy. It would be a significant disappointment for fans, who have been waiting months for the season to start. In conclusion, the ball is in the players' court as they face the deadline to accept the owners' latest proposal. The players' union wants a fair deal that works for both sides, and they aren't going to accept anything less. The pressure is high, and the stakes are even higher, but the players are taking their time to make the right decision. Fans can only hope that a resolution is reached soon, so they can see their favorite players back on the court.
