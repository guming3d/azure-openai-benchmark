article: (CNN) -- Two Norwegian citizens were sentenced to death Tuesday in the Democratic Republic of the Congo for espionage, murder and attempted murder, Norway's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has confirmed to CNN. Joshua French and Tjostolv Moland have been sentenced to death and have five days to appeal. Asked about the sentence, Lambert Mende Omalanga, Congo's minister of communications, told CNN, "We don't have a habit of commenting on judicial decisions." However, Omalanga said, his country has not carried out the death penalty in 10 years. He said lawmakers in parliament are in the process of trying to take the law off the books. A military court in Kisangani found Tjostolv Moland, 28, and Joshua French, 27, guilty on all charges, Norwegian TV2 reported. The court also ordered the pair to pay $60 million in damages. The men have five days to appeal their sentence, the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs told CNN. It was not clear why the men were in Congo. "I have earlier made absolutely clear that these two have not been conducting business for Norway in any shape or form," Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs Jonas Gahr Store told Norwegian state television NRK after the verdict. "We will now read through the sentence to see exactly how it is written," Store added. Norwegian authorities have been following the trial closely on television, and have tried to keep a balance between respecting the judicial system of a different country and helping Norwegian citizens in trouble, Store told NRK. The two men were found guilty of spying for Norway and for killing a driver in May, according to NRK. In an earlier statement on the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Web site, the ministry said that if the two Norwegians were to receive the death penalty, Norwegian authorities would immediately try to seek assurances from Congolese authorities that the death sentence would not be carried out. "Norway has a very strong stand on the death penalty, and we are very much against it," a Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman told CNN. Images on NRK TV showed that after the sentence against the two men was read, applause broke out in the courtroom. CNN's Deb Krajnak contributed to this report.

chatgpt: In a shocking verdict, two Norwegian citizens have been sentenced to death in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The Military Court found the pair guilty of espionage, murder, and attempted murder. According to the court proceedings, the Norwegians, Tjostolv Moland and Joshua French, were arrested in August 2009, after being found in possession of firearms and military uniforms. The duo claimed that they were on a road trip in the DRC but were arrested on suspicion of spying. The case took several years to reach its conclusion, and the two men have been in custody ever since. The verdict was met with condemnation from the Norwegian authorities, who called it an "unacceptable sentence." The Norwegian government said it was working to secure the release of the two men and called for clemency in the case. The case has been marred by controversy, with many human rights groups alleging that the men were subjected to torture and mistreatment during their detention. The Norwegian government has been monitoring the case closely and has repeatedly raised concerns about the treatment of the men. The verdict has also raised questions about the independence of the DRC judiciary, and human rights groups are calling for an independent inquiry into the fairness of the trial. The two men have five days to appeal their sentence, and their lawyers have indicated that they would be appealing the verdict. The case has also strained the diplomatic relations between Norway and the DRC. Norwegian authorities have maintained that the two men were innocent, while the DRC has accused them of being spies. The case has attracted international attention, with many people around the world expressing their solidarity with the two Norwegians. Protests have been held in several countries, and petitions have been started to secure their release. The Norwegian government has said that it would continue to work to secure the release of the two men, and has called on the DRC authorities to respect the human rights of all detainees in their custody. In conclusion, the verdict against the two Norwegian citizens has sparked a global outcry, with human rights groups and governments around the world expressing their concern about the fairness of the trial. The case has also highlighted the challenges faced by foreign nationals in countries with a weak justice system. The fate of Moland and French remains uncertain, but the Norwegian government has vowed to continue to fight for their release.
