The modified car, known as the "Sinister 7", took Imhoff over 17 years to develop, and he reveals that he wanted to create something that was both unique and powerful. He has achieved his goal, producing a car that exceeds even the most demanding car enthusiasts' expectations. The secret to the Sinister 7's impressive power lies in its custom-built motor.
