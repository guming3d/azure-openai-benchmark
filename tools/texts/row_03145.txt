article: Iran on Saturday welcomed the rescue of 13 Iranian sailors by a U.S. Navy ship, calling it a "humanitarian act." The sailors were on a fishing boat that had been hijacked by pirates in the Arabian Sea, near the Strait of Hormuz. According to the Navy, a helicopter from the destroyer USS Kidd spotted a suspect pirate boat alongside the Iranian vessel on Thursday. The destroyer is part of the USS John Stennis Strike Group, which moved into the Arabian Sea from the Persian Gulf last week. As the helicopter spotted the suspect pirate ship, the Kidd received a distress call from the fishing boat's captain, saying pirates were holding him and his crew captive. A team from the Kidd boarded the vessel, took 15 suspected pirates into custody, and freed 13 Iranian hostages, the Navy said. A spokesman for Iran's Foreign Ministry, Ramin Mehmanparast, had positive words about the rescue when he spoke Saturday to the Arabic news network Al-Alam. "Rescuing Iranian sailors by the U.S. was a humanitarian act and we welcome such acts," he said. "The Iranian Navy also engages in such rescue operations. It is the responsibility of all nations to rescue nationals from other countries from pirates." The carrier strike group's presence in the Persian Gulf had drawn the ire of Iranian military officials, who said the United States should not send any more warships into the Gulf. Iranian Brig. Gen. Ahmad Vahidi said "there is no need" for countries outside of the region to have a presence there. "Their presence does nothing but create mayhem," Vahidi said, according to the semi-official Fars News Agency. The suspected pirates, mostly Somalis, were taken to the Stennis to be held until a decision is made about prosecution, Pentagon spokesman Capt. John Kirby said Friday. Pirates hijacked the fishing vessel, the Al Molai, 40 to 45 days ago, U.S. Naval Forces Central Command said in a statement. The crew was "held hostage, with limited rations and we believe were forced against their will to assist the pirates with other piracy operations," according to the statement. The Navy team provided food, water and medical care to both the suspected pirates and the Al Molai's crew after securing the ship and ensuring everyone was safe, said Josh Schminky, a Navy Criminal Investigative Service agent aboard the Kidd. The crew had "been through a lot," he said, adding, "We went out of our way to treat the fishing crew with kindness and respect." Defense Secretary Leon Panetta on Friday congratulated the strike group commander, Rear Adm. Craig Faller, and his team on the rescue, saying they did the right thing. "When we get a distress signal, we're going to respond. That's the nature of what our country is all about," Panetta said, according to Pentagon spokesman George Little.

chatgpt: The USS Kidd, a destroyer ship of the United States Navy, made headlines yesterday after it rescued 13 Iranian sailors who had been held captive by suspected pirates. The sailors were rescued on Thursday, and the incident has drawn praise from Iran, which has called it a "humanitarian act" carried out by the US Navy. According to reports, the sailors had been held captive for several weeks before their rescue. The pirate group had reportedly demanded a ransom in exchange for the release of the sailors, but negotiations had broken down, and the situation had become tense. The US Navy became aware of the situation and dispatched the USS Kidd to the area to investigate. The crew of the warship quickly located the hostages and successfully rescued them without any incidents or injuries. Following the rescue, the Iranian Foreign Ministry issued a statement expressing gratitude to the US Navy for its quick response and humanitarian action. It is noteworthy that this gesture comes during a time of heightened tensions between Washington and Tehran, with both sides still reeling from the recent assassination of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani. The USS Kidd is part of a naval task force that operates in the Gulf of Aden, a strategic waterway that links the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea. The area has been plagued by piracy in recent years, with numerous vessels being targeted by armed groups seeking ransom or other forms of payment. The US Navy has been actively engaged in combating piracy in the region for many years, working closely with international partners to thwart pirate activity and ensure the safe passage of ships. The rescue of the Iranian sailors, while significant in and of itself, is emblematic of the broader cooperation that exists among nations to confront shared security challenges. The commander of the USS Kidd, who led the rescue mission, commended his crew for their bravery and professionalism in executing the mission. The crew of the ship responded rapidly and efficiently to the situation and were successful in rescuing the hostages within a short period of time. The rescue operation has been hailed as a success story and an example of how international cooperation can produce positive outcomes in the complex and volatile security environment of the Gulf of Aden. It is hoped that the successful rescue of the Iranian sailors will lead to closer cooperation between the US Navy and Iranian authorities in combating piracy in the region. The USS Kidd is expected to remain on patrol in the Gulf of Aden as part of its ongoing mission to safeguard shipping lanes and maintain security in the region. The crew of the ship will undoubtedly be remembered for their valor and dedication to ensuring the safety and security of all those who sail in these vital waters.  In conclusion, the rescue of the 13 Iranian sailors by the USS Kidd is a positive development in the ongoing efforts to combat piracy in the Gulf of Aden. The US Navy's quick response and successful mission have drawn praise from Iran and underscored the importance of international cooperation in addressing shared security challenges.
