article: By . Mark Prigg . It may not net him quite as much cash as a Hollywood blockbuster, or have quite the same budget - but Tom Hanks hopes his latest project will help people write. The Hanx Writer app recreates three classic typewriters on screen - allowing people to hear and see them. Developers worked with the actor, who has previously spoken of his love for vintage typewriters. Scroll down for video . Thwe Hanx Writer app has three vintage typewriters - and sound and looks exactly like them. Users can email or print their work to retain its look. The app has three typewriters to choose from, and each recreates the sound and fonts of the original machine. 'The Hanx Prime Select is the writer’s best friend and is free; the Hanx 707 is bold enough for any journey; and the Hanx Golden Touch is sleek and elegant.' Hanx Writer recreates the experience of a manual typewriter, but with the ease and speed of an iPad, the developers said. 'With Hanx Writer, you’ll hear the rhythm of your work with SHOOK SHOOK or FITT-FITT.” – Tom Hanks said. 'No longer must you surrender modern luxuries, like the DELETE key, to enjoy the look, feel, and sound of good, old-fashioned word-processing.' Each document written in Hanx Writer can be emailed, printed, and shared and has its own unique statement-making personality. 'I wanted to have the sensation of an old manual typewriter – I wanted the sound of typing if nothing else,' Hanks said. Hanks tweeted this picture of himself to show he also uses more traditional keyboards. 'Because I find it’s like music that spurs along the creative urge. Bang bang clack-clack-clack puckapuckapuckapucka… I wanted the ‘report’ of each letter, each line.' He says the app is a 'tool, not a toy', and has been collecting typewriters since the 1970s. 'I use a manual typewriter — and the United States Postal Service — almost every day,' he recently wrote in the New York Times. 'My snail-mail letters and thank-you notes, office memos and to-do lists, and rough — and I mean very rough — drafts of story pages are messy things, but the creating of them satisfies me like few other daily tasks.' 'Tom sent us three vintage typewriters from his personal collection for us to enjoy during this project,' the developers said. Users can choose between three specially created vintage typewriters. 'We took full advantage of this and typed a few pages on each one. 'We had a little fun with them as well! On a new employee’s first day, he was welcomed to Hitcents with a desk 'fully stocked' with one of Tom’s typewriters, a sheet of paper, and a pencil.' He also explained the differences between the three typewriters in the app, adding that the Prime Select would let you 'bang away', while the 707 is smaller and quieter, and the Golden Touch is the luxury model.

chatgpt: Acclaimed actor Tom Hanks has been known for his passion for collecting vintage typewriters since the 1970s. His impressive collection includes over 200 typewriters of various makes and models. Hanks has showed off his typewriting treasures on several occasions, and has even created a unique app called "Hanx Writer" that simulates the look and feel of a classic typewriter on an iPad. Now, Hanks has taken his typewriter obsession to a whole new level by lending some of his vintage machines to software developers who have digitized them for use on modern devices. Several virtual versions of Hanks' typewriters have been created, and can be accessed through the Hanx Writer app. The unique feature of the Hanx Writer app is the ability to completely replace the standard keyboard on an iPad with a vintage typewriter interface. Users can type on the virtual keys, watch as the paper feeds through the machine, and even hear the unmistakable sound of the return bell. Each machine has been carefully modeled after a real typewriter in Hanks' collection, and the app offers a wide range of customization options to adjust the color, texture, and even the typeface of the virtual paper. "I started collecting typewriters in the 1970s, because they were just everywhere back then," Hanks said in an interview with the New York Times. "And I always loved the way they looked and felt. So, when the developers approached me about making virtual versions of my machines, I jumped at the chance. I wanted to share that same tactile experience with a new generation who might never have seen a typewriter before." The Hanx Writer app has become a sensation among writers, students, and anyone looking for a unique typing experience. Users have praised the app for its simplicity, ease of use, and the nostalgia it evokes. Many have even remarked that the app has helped them break their writer's block and find a renewed joy in writing. Hanks is thrilled with the success of the Hanx Writer app, and hopes that it will inspire more people to rediscover the joys of typewriting. He admits to still using typewriters in his own writing process, and says that there's nothing quite like the tactile sensation of putting words on paper. He also credits typewriters for helping him learn how to write and develop his craft as an actor and screenwriter. The Hanx Writer app is available for free on the App Store, with in-app purchases for additional typewriter models and customization options. With Hanks' virtual typewriters, anyone can experience the charm and simplicity of an era gone by.
