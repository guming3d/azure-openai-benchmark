article: (CNN) -- He was the soccer referee known as "golden whistle" who officiated in high-profile events such as the World Cup and the Olympics. But a Chinese court has called fulltime on Lun Ju's career by jailing him for match fixing. China's state news agency Xinhua reported on Thursday that Lu has been sentenced to five and a half years in prison by a court in Liaoning Province after accepting $128,000 to fix seven matches in China's national league. Three other officials -- Huang Junjie, Wan Daxue and Zhou Weixin -- were also jailed for seven, six, and three and a half years respectively. The cases were brought after a government crackdown on persistent allegations of gambling, match fixing and corruption in China's football leagues was launched in 2009. But it is the fall of Lu that has grabbed the most headlines around the world. He was the first Chinese official to referee at a World Cup, when South Korea and Japan hosted the showpiece event in 2002. Prior to that he had taken charge of matches at the 2000 Sydney Olympics and was twice voted referee of the year by the Asian Football Confederation. But the court in the city of Dandong, near the border with North Korea, found that Lu had altered the outcome of seven games that involved four clubs including Shanghai Shenhua, who have just signed former France striker Nicolas Anelka from English club Chelsea. Huang was convicted of accepting $247,975 from seven separate cases while $31,760 of his personal assets were also confiscated. Zhou was proved to have taken $77,829 to fix eight games. In 2004 he awarded a penalty in a Chinese Super League match that prompted seven clubs to protest against the Chinese Football Association. Zhou and Huang were also found to have fixed the outcome of two international matches, while Wan was convicted of accepting $149,306 to influence games. Former CFA vice-president Yang Yimin and ex-CFA Referee Committee director Zhang Jianqiang are due to be sentenced on February 18, Xinhua reported. The fact that several of China's top clubs were alluded to in the court cases also casts doubt on the new league season, due to begin in March, as they await to hear if they will be sanctioned.

chatgpt: Former World Cup referee Lu Jun has been sentenced to five and a half years in prison in China for his involvement in match fixing. According to China's state news agency, Xinhua, Jun was found guilty of accepting bribes amounting to $128,000 to fix seven matches in the Chinese league.  Jun was not the only referee implicated in this scandal. Three other referees were also found guilty of match fixing and were handed jail terms. This news has sent shockwaves through the football community, further damaging the sport's reputation in China.  Match fixing is a serious problem in many sports, including football. It is a criminal offense that involves rigging a game to produce a pre-determined outcome, usually for the benefit of gambling syndicates. Match fixing undermines the integrity of the sport, as it creates an uneven playing field and leads to unfair results.  The Chinese Football Association has taken measures to combat match fixing in recent years, including launching an anti-corruption campaign and implementing stricter penalties for offenders. This recent scandal involving Lu Jun and his accomplices is evidence that there is still work to be done in eradicating match fixing from football in China.  The Chinese public is outraged over this latest scandal, seeing it as yet another example of corruption in the country's sporting industry. The Chinese government has long been involved in efforts to crack down on corruption in various industries, including sports. It is likely that further measures will be taken to prevent match fixing in the future.  Critics argue that severe punishment is necessary to deter people from engaging in match fixing. However, others argue that education and cultural change are equally important, as many people who participate in match fixing are not aware of the serious consequences of their actions.  In the meantime, the news of Lu Jun's sentencing will serve as a warning to others who may be considering engaging in match fixing. It is a reminder that corruption will not be tolerated in sports or any other industry, and that those who engage in it will face harsh consequences.  In conclusion, the sentencing of Lu Jun and three other referees for match fixing is a reminder of the ongoing problem of corruption in sports, particularly football. While efforts are being made to combat this issue, there is still work to be done to ensure that the sport is played fairly and with integrity. The recent scandal should serve as a wake-up call to all those involved in football, reminding them of the importance of honesty and fair play in the sport.
