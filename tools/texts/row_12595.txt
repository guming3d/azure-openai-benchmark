chatgpt: New York City - The Rockefeller Center Christmas tree has been a staple of the holiday season in New York City for nearly nine decades. This year, the Norway spruce selected to be the centerpiece of the 2019 holiday display was chosen before Hurricane Sandy struck the East Coast in 2012. Despite the fact that the tree's owner lost power following the storm, the spruce survived and has since flourished. Today, workers cut down the tree and prepared it for transport to Rockefeller Center. "This tree is a symbol of resilience and strength," said Mayor Bill de Blasio at the cutting ceremony in Oneonta, New York. "It represents the ability to overcome adversity and come out stronger on the other side." The 77-foot-tall spruce will be adorned with more than 50,000 multi-colored LED lights, and topped with a Swarovski crystal star that measures nine and a half feet in diameter. The tree will be officially lit on November 28th, when tens of thousands of visitors are expected to converge on Rockefeller Plaza to witness the lighting ceremony. "This tree is truly remarkable," said Tishman Speyer CEO Rob Speyer. "It's a testament to the endurance of New Yorkers and the power of the holiday spirit. We're honored to have it as the centerpiece of our holiday display." The tree will be installed in Rockefeller Plaza in the coming days, where it will be prepared for the official lighting ceremony. The ceremony will feature live music, celebrity guests, and appearances by Santa Claus and other holiday characters. The Rockefeller Center Christmas tree has been an annual tradition since 1931, when workers from the construction site put up a small tree to lift their spirits during the Great Depression. Today, the tree stands as a symbol of hope, happiness, and community spirit for people throughout the world. "We come here every year to see the tree and feel the magic of the holiday season," said John Smith, who traveled from Atlanta to witness the cutting ceremony. "It's a tradition that we look forward to, and this year's tree is extra special because of its resilience and strength." The tree will be on display throughout the holiday season, and visitors are encouraged to visit Rockefeller Center to view the tree and take part in the festivities. The plaza will be transformed into a winter wonderland, featuring ice skating, holiday markets, and other attractions.  As the holiday season approaches, the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree provides a beacon of hope and joy for people from all walks of life. This year's tree is a reminder of the power of resilience and the importance of coming together to overcome adversity.  So, this Christmas be there at the Rockefeller Center and witness the magic of the season.
