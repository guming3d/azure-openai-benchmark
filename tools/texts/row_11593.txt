"It is heart-warming to see how much sympathy his family is shown and I can say that the family is extremely grateful for it. "However, it should not be forgotten that Michael's family is dealing with an extremely intimate and fragile situation. "And I would like to remind all of us that Michael has always actively kept his family out of the public eye and consequently protected their private lives. "We try to channel all the energies we have toward Michael and we firmly believe that this will help him. And we believe that he will also win this fight."
