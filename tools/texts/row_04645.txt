article: When her culinary skills surprisingly let her down, Ruby Tandoh found a new ingredient for the Great British Bake Off judges – a flood of tears. She appeared inconsolable after making basic errors during Tuesday’s semi-final. With tears rolling down her cheeks, the 21-year-old philosophy student clearly feared she was for the chop. And whether it was the shock of messing up or a bid for sympathy, it worked. Just add water: Ruby Tandoh bursts into tears as she awaits her fate before Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry . She was spared by the judges, who put her through to next week’s final, kicking out 31-year-old Beca Lyne-Pirkis instead. However Miss Tandoh’s performance won little sympathy from viewers, many of whom have already claimed that judge Paul Hollywood favours the attractive former model. On Twitter, many criticised her weepy performance and suggested she survived only because the judges felt sorry for her. Lorenzo Cibrario wrote: ‘I really just can’t stand Ruby. Stop crying all the time.’ Beth Sykes added: ‘I swear Ruby has spent most of her time crying instead of baking.’ Cry me a river: Ruby gets a helping hand to wipe the tears from her face when a task does not go to plan . A third tweeted: ‘Poor, poor judging – poor Beca so deserves a place – complete farce that Ruby is through to the final’. Another described a spat with Hollywood over her decision to use saffron in one recipe as like ‘a lovers tiff’. This week’s challenges required the four contestants to make savoury canapés, a charlotte royale dessert and an opera cake. Miss Tandoh’s canapés were praised, with Mary Berry saying the pastry was ‘beautifully cooked’, but her charlotte royale came last and her chocolate, almond praline and saffron opera cake ‘didn’t have the finish’ the judges wanted although it ‘tasted good’. Falling flat: Ruby failed to get the height needed for the technical challenge . Made it through:  Ruby was reduced to tears yet again when she found out she was in the finals . They were left unimpressed by  Mrs Lyne-Pirkis’s ‘unmemorable’ canapés, although her charlotte royal beat Miss Tandoh’s. She then made a banoffee-flavoured opera cake, which scored well on presentation but poorly on flavour, meaning she missed out on a place in the final. Bookmakers have now made Miss Tandoh the favourite to beat the other two finalists, Kimberley Wilson and Frances Quinn, next week. Bake Off will move to BBC1 next year after attracting BBC2’s best audience this year with an average of seven million.
