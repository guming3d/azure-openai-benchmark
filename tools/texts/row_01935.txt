The 'world's oldest public toilet' has been discovered in Argentina - and scientists claim dinosaurs used enormous piles of faeces to scare away predators. The 240-million-year-old 'communal latrine' contained thousands of fossilised stools, known as coprolites, from the Dinodontosaurus, one of the largest herbivores of the Triassic era and similar to modern rhinos. It was found in the La Rioja Province in north-west Argentina and predates the former earliest megaherbivore communal latrine by 20 million years. Scroll down for video . Prehistoric latrines: The fossilised faeces, called coprolites, were found in dense formations and have been called the world's oldest public toilet . The stools are believed to have been produced by Dinodontosaurus, one of the largest herbivores of the Triassic era and similar to modern rhinos . There are two reasons for the communal toilets - hygiene and warning potential predators to stay away, according to Scientific Reports. Dr Lucas Fiorelli, of Crilar-Conicet, who discovered the dung heaps, told the BBC: 'Firstly, it was important to avoid parasites - "you don't poo where you eat", as the saying goes. 'But it's also a warning to predators. If you leave a huge pile, you are saying: "Hey! We are a big herd. Watch out!"' A selection of coprolites, demonstrating their various shapes and sizes, which shows they came from a herd of beasts . The evidence also bolsters the hypothesis that Dinodontosaurus were sociable creatures. An estimated 30,000 coprolites are spread across the area, with a density of up to 94 coprolites per square metre. The largest of them weigh several kilogrammes and reach lengths of up to 35cm. The variation in size and shapes, ranging from tiny nuggets to long and thin, suggest they belong to several different herbivores of varying ages. They are a rich store of new information about the ecology of ancient ecosystems as latrines like this are extremely rare because faeces decomposes so quickly. Dr Fiorelli said a sheet of volcanic ash has preserved the ancient dung piles 'like Pompeii'. Martin Hechenleitner, another author on the study, says they contain clues, on now-extinct plants, fungi, and parasites at a vital point in the history of evolution. He said: 'This was a crucial time in evolutionary history. The first mammals were there, living alongside the grandfather of dinosaurs. 'Maybe with these fossils we can glimpse into the lost environment which gave rise to the dinosaurs.'

chatgpt: Scientists in Argentina have made a groundbreaking discovery that could shed light on the eating habits and social behavior of ancient reptiles. They have discovered a 240-million-year-old "communal latrine", a site where a large herd of reptiles left behind large piles of faeces. The site was found in San Juan province in northwestern Argentina, which is famous for its spectacular geological formations. Researchers discovered the site during an expedition in 2019 and have been studying the ancient animal droppings ever since. The site is believed to have been used by hundreds of ancient reptiles. The droppings were piled up in a small area, forming a mound that would have warned predators of the presence of a large herd. This is a behavior that is seen in modern animals, such as wildebeests, which gather in large numbers for protection against predators. The faeces contain fascinating insights into the extinct plant life of the region. By analyzing the remains of plant material found in the droppings, researchers have been able to reconstruct the ancient ecosystem. They have identified a number of extinct plant species that were once common in the region, including ferns and horsetails. The discovery of the communal latrine has also provided clues about the social behavior of ancient reptiles. It is believed that they may have gathered in large herds for protection against predators, or for breeding purposes. The researchers hope to uncover more information about the behavior of these ancient animals as they continue to study the site. The discovery of the communal latrine is an important breakthrough for paleontologists, as it provides a rare glimpse into the lives of ancient reptiles. The site is one of the largest of its kind ever discovered and is expected to yield even more insights into the behavior and ecology of these fascinating creatures. Dr. Lucas Fiorelli, a paleontologist from the Universidad Nacional de San Juan in Argentina, who led the expedition, said the discovery was "like finding a treasure trove". He added: "It's a very rare occurrence. In fact, there's only a handful of these sites in the world." The discovery of the communal latrine is just one example of how paleontologists are able to use fossilized faeces to learn more about ancient animals. Known as coprolites, these fossilized droppings can provide valuable information about an animal's diet, health, and even its behavior. The researchers are now planning to further study the site and hope to uncover more information about the ancient reptiles that once roamed the area. They also hope that the discovery will inspire others to explore the region and help uncover even more secrets from the past.
