article: (CNN) -- The military is investigating a "shocking and deplorable" YouTube video that seems to show a Marine throwing a puppy off a rocky cliff. YouTube.com removed the video for violating the Web site's terms of use. The black-and-white puppy makes a yelping sound as it flies through the air. "That's mean, that was mean," one companion says off-camera, addressing the alleged puppy thrower by his last name. The fate of the animal is not known. The Marine is identified on the video and in other Internet postings as a lance corporal stationed at Marine Corps Base Hawaii in Kaneohe. It's not clear where the video was shot, although the man who appears to throw the puppy and another Marine are in full combat gear with helmets. YouTube.com had taken down the video by 12:30 p.m. ET Tuesday "due to terms of use violation," according to a banner on the Web site. "This is a shocking and deplorable video that is contrary to the high standards that we set for every Marine," Marine Corps spokesman Maj. Chris Perrine said at a news conference Monday night. "We will investigate this and take appropriate actions," Perrine said.  Watch other Marines and civilians react to the video Â» . He said the Marine is being kept safe in view of the anger over the alleged incident. Perrine added that the majority of Marines conduct themselves honorably. "There are many examples of Marines who adopt pets and bring them back from Iraq and demonstrate their compassion on a daily basis," he said. If the video is deemed legitimate, the lance corporal could face a charge of conduct unbecoming a Marine, Perrine said. There could be administrative action, nonjudicial punishment or a court-martial, he added. "It's all governed by the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and anything from reduction in pay to reduction in rank to confinement to discharge from the Marine Corps" is possible, Perrine said. If others are involved, they too will be disciplined, he said. "Certainly, there's a lot of outrage, and a lot of people are upset about it. I think every Marine is upset about this video," he said. "We hope that it turns out not to be what it looks like." E-mail to a friend .

chatgpt: In a shocking and deplorable video that has gone viral on social media, a U.S. Marine appears to throw a small dog over a cliff. The video has sparked outrage and prompted an investigation by the Marine Corps. The location of the incident is still unknown, but it appears that the Marines in the video are in full combat gear. The video shows a Marine holding a small dog by the scruff of its neck, before apparently tossing it over a cliff. The dog can be heard yelping as it falls. A spokesman for the Marine Corps called the video "shocking and deplorable" and said that an investigation was underway to identify the Marine in question. The spokesman added that the Marine could face mild to severe discipline for his actions. Animal rights activists have been quick to condemn the incident, with many calling for the Marine to be held accountable for his actions. The video has also sparked a wider debate about the treatment of animals in the military. While the vast majority of military personnel treat animals with care and respect, incidents like this can undermine public trust in the military and damage its reputation. It is important that the Marine Corps takes swift action to address this incident and ensure that all members of the military are trained to treat animals humanely. The Marine Corps has a long history of working with dogs, both as working animals and as pets. Dogs have played an important role in a wide range of military operations, from tracking down insurgents to providing comfort and companionship to soldiers in the field. However, incidents like this show that there is still work to be done to ensure that all members of the military understand the importance of treating animals with care and respect. The Marine Corps needs to send a clear message that acts of animal cruelty will not be tolerated, and that those who engage in such behavior will face serious consequences. In conclusion, the video of a Marine apparently throwing a small dog over a cliff is a shocking and deplorable incident that has sparked outrage and prompted an investigation by the Marine Corps. While the vast majority of military personnel treat animals with care and respect, incidents like this undermine public trust in the military and highlight the need for ongoing efforts to promote humane treatment of animals in the military. The Marine Corps must take swift and decisive action to address this incident and ensure that all members of the military understand the importance of treating animals with care and respect.
