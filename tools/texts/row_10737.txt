article: As Venezuelan opposition leaders push for demonstrators to stay in the streets, "he who tires, loses" is their mantra. Lilian Tintori de Lopez, the wife of jailed Venezuelan opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez, held up a T-shirt showing the phrase before protesters Monday. Beside her, opposition leader Henrique Capriles called for demonstrators to keep demanding change from the South American country's government and described President Nicolas Maduro as "an error in the history of the country." Outrage at soaring crime and a tanking economy triggered protests earlier this month. Tintori called for a new demonstration Wednesday, asking women to march silently in peaceful protest, wearing white and carrying white flowers for each of their children, "for the future of our children and grandchildren." On their arms, she told them to wear black bands, "because we are in mourning for all those who have fallen in recent days." Venezuelan Attorney General Luisa Ortega Diaz said Monday that 13 people have died and at least 147 people have been injured in clashes since protests began. Forty-five people detained during demonstrations remain behind bars; nine of them are government forces, she said. Opposition leaders and government officials blame each other for the unrest, and both sides show no sign of backing down. In a nationally televised government meeting, Maduro said he was convening a peace conference on Wednesday for mayors, governors and leading lawmakers to sign a deal renouncing violence. As anti-government demonstrators barricaded streets and tried to maintain their momentum, supporters also rallied behind Maduro on Monday. Pro-government motorcycle clubs were the latest core group to show public support for Maduro, who insists the opposition is trying to stage a U.S.-funded coup attempt. Some opposition protesters have accused bands of pro-government motorcyclists of fueling violence during demonstrations. Maduro called on the crowd Monday to help protect peace in the country and exercise "maximum self control." "Do not fall for provocations and prepare yourselves," Maduro said. "We are facing a massive plan. ... We have to be prepared every day to defeat the continuous fascist coup."

chatgpt: Opposition protesters in Venezuela are determined to maintain the momentum of their protests despite the recent loss of 13 lives in clashes with government authorities. The country's attorney general, Tarek William Saab, announced the death toll on Wednesday, in response to protests that began in January amid ongoing economic and political crises. Saab identified the victims as nine men and four women who were of varying ages. All were killed during the protests against the government of President Nicolas Maduro, who is accused of overseeing a failing economy and political repression. The government denies wrongdoing, saying the protesters are trying to destabilize the nation. The protesters, primarily made up of young people, have been demonstrating across the country for nearly three months, calling for Maduro's resignation, improved living conditions, and free elections. Despite the deaths, they have vowed to continue their campaign, staging more rallies and engaging in civil disobedience. Supporters of President Maduro have also taken to the streets in droves, staging counterprotests and pledging their loyalty to the embattled leader. Maduro has been in power since the death of his predecessor, Hugo Chavez, in 2013, and is facing widespread discontent over the state of the Venezuelan economy. Maduro, in response to the ongoing protests, has announced that he is planning a peace conference to address the country's political crisis. He has stated that the conference will include representatives of all political parties and social groups, but opposition leaders have rejected the proposal, calling it a smokescreen to distract from the real issues. The international community has been closely monitoring the situation in Venezuela, with several countries denouncing the government's handling of the protests. The United States has imposed targeted sanctions against high-ranking officials in the Venezuelan government, accusing them of corruption and human rights abuses. With the protests showing no signs of abating, and the death toll rising, the situation in Venezuela remains tenuous. The government and opposition alike must find a way out of the crisis to prevent further loss of life and damage to the country's institutions.
