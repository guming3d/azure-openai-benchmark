chatgpt: Manchester City has emerged as the biggest earner in the Premier League, after clinching the title with a record-breaking 100 points. The club earned a staggering £98m in prize money, thanks to their impressive form throughout the season. Despite finishing seventh, Manchester United still managed to pocket £91m. This is largely due to the fact that the club was featured in more televised games than any other team, resulting in greater revenue from broadcasting rights. Another team that benefited from their season performance was Sunderland. Their escape from the relegation zone earned them an additional £7.2m. This may not seem like a huge amount compared to the earning of Manchester City and Manchester United, but for Sunderland, this is a significant sum of money that could potentially help to strengthen their squad for next season. Stoke City, on the other hand, earned an additional £1.2m for their final-day victory. While this may not seem like a substantial amount, it is worth noting that every penny counts in the competitive world of professional football. This extra income could help Stoke to recruit new players and improve their performance next season. Overall, the earnings of each club in the Premier League are based on their final league position, the number of televised games they appeared in, and their share of broadcasting revenue. Other factors also feed into the final earnings of clubs, including their performance in domestic and European cup competitions. For example, Liverpool who finished fourth, earned £146.3m in total - £29m more than Manchester United who finished two positions above. However, despite the earning gap between the biggest earners and the lowest in the Premier League, it is worth noting that each team still has reason to be proud of their achievements. For some, simply avoiding relegation is the ultimate goal, while others aim to finish in the top four to secure a coveted spot in the Champions League. For Manchester City, the win and the financial reward that comes with it, will confirm their status as one of the strongest teams in the English Premier League. The club can now focus on building a squad capable of retaining their title next year. While for the likes of Sunderland and Stoke, the extra income will allow them to invest in their squads, in their hopes of avoiding a similar fate as occurred in the 2017/18 season. In any case, the Premier League has once again produced an exciting season of football, and it is clear that success on and off the pitch is not exclusive to just a few wealthy clubs.
