article: Cairo (CNN) -- Members of Egypt's Olympic team were given fake Nike gear to wear during training in London, athletes and a distributor said. Synchronized swimmer Yomna Khallaf described the kit Egypt's athletes received in a series of Twitter posts this week. "The bags for example have (a) big Nike logo in the front and the zippers are Adidas," Khallaf wrote. Officials accepted a bid from an unauthorized vendor who offered Nike gear at half the price, according to Adly el-Shafie, the commercial director of Nike's only agent and distributor in Egypt. El-Shafie said he notified Egyptian officials twice that they had purchased counterfeit gear from an unauthorized distributor, but received no response. "The scandal was clear when Egypt's Olympic fencing team approached us complaining about the sizes of their training kit and attire to be worn around the Olympic Village," said el-Shafie, commercial director of Allied Trading and Consulting. A senior official from the Egyptian Olympic Committee's London delegation declined CNN's request for comment. But Egypt's top Olympics official defended the move in an interview with the state-owned Ahram Online news site. "We bought the clothing from a Nike agent. You can never tell the difference between the original and the fake ones," Gen. Mahmoud Ahmed Ali, chairman of the Egyptian Olympic Committee, told Ahram Online. "All Nike products in the Egyptian market are made in China. They all have the same logo. How can you know?" Ali urged the U.S.-based company to trace the agent who sold them the counterfeit clothing and to "sue him." "It's like if somebody created false coins and you happened to possess them. Is it your fault then?" he said. In a statement Thursday, Nike said it was discussing the allegations with Egyptian officials and trying to reach a solution for Egypt's Olympic team, which has 113 athletes competing in 19 sports. "Nike is highly concerned that if these allegations are true, the athletes will have received products that do not meet Nike's quality standards," the company said in a statement. "Nike's authorized distributor in Egypt sent two official communications to the EOC on this issue weeks ago and on July 20, 2012, Nike also sent a written communication to the EOC requesting the Committee to take immediate action." Officials responded for the first time Wednesday, Nike said, adding that the company believes the issue with the Egyptian Olympic Committee is an "isolated incident." "We are currently cooperating with the EOC toward reaching a solution within the next 48 hours," el-Shafie told CNN on Wednesday. In the meantime, Khallaf said in a Twitter post that she shelled out 2,000 Egyptian pounds ($330) of her own money to buy new gear. "It's so frustrating that we had to pay extra...to have other proper stuff to wear so that we can look okay, not even good," she wrote.

chatgpt: Swimming and fencing gear complaints have been raised in Egypt as athletes reported authenticity concerns on sports apparel provided for the national teams. Swimmer Youssef Elkamash posted a photo on Facebook showing a swim bag with Nike logos and an Adidas zipper, sparking outrage from fans and athletes alike. Fencers, on the other hand, filed complaints about the sizes of the attire distributed for them. Egyptian sports distributor, Intersport Egypt, denied accusations of selling counterfeit merchandise. "We're confident we purchase directly from official sources and not through third-party players," the distributor said in a statement. "Weâ€™re building a good relationship with international suppliers and we have certificates for each item to prove its authenticity." However, an official from the Egyptian Ministry of Sports said that the authenticity of the items is hard to verify, stating that "you can't tell the difference between the original and the fake ones." Nike, one of the brands mentioned in the complaints, stated that it is looking into the allegations and is in discussions with Egyptian officials. The allegations of fake merchandise have raised concerns over athlete safety during international competitions, including the Tokyo Olympics. The use of counterfeit gear in sports has long been a concern, with fake products posing potential hazards to athletes. In response to the allegations, professional athletes and sports fans have taken to social media to express their disappointment and shock. Elkamash's Facebook post garnered thousands of reactions and shares, with many calling for better regulation and scrutiny of sports apparel in Egypt. The allegations could also tarnish the reputation of Egyptian athletes and their performance in upcoming international competitions. Many athletes rely on their equipment and apparel for optimal performance, and subpar gear could significantly affect their ability to compete. The government and authorities in Egypt are set to investigate the accusations and will likely enforce stricter regulations on the distribution and sale of sports apparel. The allegations also highlight the need for sports authorities worldwide to prioritize the safety and performance of athletes by ensuring that they are provided with authentic and high-quality equipment and apparel. As the investigations continue, athletes and fans are hopeful that this issue will be resolved promptly, and the safety and performance of athletes will be prioritized. The Egyptian sports community is calling for transparency, accountability, and action to ensure that such issues do not occur again in the future.
