article: The man who invented the vanishing spray that has been used at the World Cup said UEFA will use it in the Champions League for the first time next season - and hopes it will be adopted in the Premier League. The foam has been used by referees at free-kicks to make sure defensive walls do not encroach on the 10-yard gap - it lasts around a minute before it disappears. Thin white line Vanishing spray to mark out free-kicks has been used at the World Cup . Heine Allegmagne worked with a company to concoct the spray from vegetable oil derivatives and it was used for the first time in a competitive match in Belo Horizonte in 2000. He has obtained the international patent for the firm. It was adopted widely in Brazil and Argentina and was used in 18,000 games in numerous competitions before being passed by the International FA Board in 2012 as being permitted for use in any country. The Premier League is expected to discuss with clubs whether to introduce it after being given a report from its referees chief Mike Riley. In the air: The Premier League is expected to discuss with clubs whether to use it . Allegmagne, speaking in Belo Horizonte ahead of the Brazil v Germany semi-final, said: 'It's already been agreed that UEFA will use this in their championships. 'Some people have been conservative but I hope that people around the world, including the Premier League, will be impressed by what they have seen in this World Cup. Allegmagne, who is from Minais Gerais - the state in which Belo Horizonte is located - said the spray costs around Â£3 per can. He has provided 320 to FIFA for the World Cup in Brazil. In action: The spray stops defensive walls from encroaching too far forward . He added: 'The Eureka moment came when I was listening to the radio and the commentator was talking about the wall not staying back. It came to me I could do something. 'I wanted to solve a technical problem that had been plaguing football for more than a century. 'The big historic moment came in 2000 when the spray was first used here in Belo Horizonte.' Allegmagne first called the spray Spuni before he teamed up with an Argentinian, Pablo Silva, to improve it. The new version was renamed 9.15 Fair Play - a reference to the wall having to be 9.15metres (10 yards) from the free-kick.

chatgpt: Ever since the introduction of vanishing spray in the 2014 World Cup, the foam has become an indispensable tool for referees to ensure that defensive walls do not encroach on the 10-yard gap during dead-ball situations. Hailed as a revolutionary invention, vanishing spray, a foam made from vegetable oil derivatives, has played a critical role in ensuring fair play and preventing contentious incidents on the pitch. The mastermind behind vanishing spray is Heine Allegmagne, who worked with a company to create the foam. Allegmagne's invention was quickly adopted in Brazil and Argentina, where it was widely praised for its effectiveness in keeping defensive walls in check. Since then, the vanishing spray has been used in 18,000 games across various competitions, proving to be a game-changer for referees and players alike. The popularity of vanishing spray lies in its simplicity and ease of use. Referees can carry the foam in a can and use it when needed without disrupting the flow of the game. When sprayed, the foam creates a temporary line on the pitch, which disappears within a minute, leaving no residue or damage to the grass. The vanishing spray serves as a clear visual aid for referees and reminds players of their obligation to stay 10 yards away from the ball during free-kicks. The introduction of vanishing spray has had a significant impact on the game, reducing time-wasting and preventing defensive walls from encroaching on the 10-yard gap. The foam has also been praised for its role in preventing referee-player confrontations and for improving the accuracy of offside decisions. The success of vanishing spray has led to its adoption in various leagues worldwide, including the English Premier League, La Liga, and the German Bundesliga. The foam has also been used in international competitions such as the Copa America, the Euros, and the Women's World Cup. Despite its widespread adoption, some critics argue that vanishing spray has made the game more complicated and that referees should rely on their instincts and judgment instead. However, the overwhelming support for vanishing spray from players, coaches, and referees suggests that the foam is here to stay and will continue to play a crucial role in maintaining fairness and promoting good sportsmanship on the pitch. In conclusion, the success of vanishing spray during the World Cup has made it an essential tool for referees and a game-changer for the sport. Its ease of use, effectiveness, and widespread adoption make it clear that vanishing spray is here to stay, and it will continue to contribute to fair play and good sportsmanship on the pitch.
