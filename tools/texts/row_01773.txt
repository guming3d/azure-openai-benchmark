chatgpt: The News of the World phone hacking scandal has made its way across the Atlantic, with a new victim coming forward to claim that her voicemails were targeted while she was in America. Ms. Stark, a UK citizen living in the United States, has been told by the Metropolitan Police that she may have been a victim of the News of the World phone hacking scandal, which rocked the UK in 2011. According to Ms. Stark, she became suspicious when she noticed that her voicemail messages were being deleted without her permission. She initially thought it was a technical glitch, but when it continued to happen, she contacted her phone service provider to investigate. It was during this investigation that Ms. Stark discovered that her voicemail account had been accessed without her knowledge or consent, and that messages had been deleted. The phone service provider was able to trace the unauthorized access to a location in the UK, which is where Ms. Stark suspects the hacking originated. Ms. Stark has now instructed Mark Lewis, a well-known lawyer who has represented numerous victims of the News of the World phone hacking scandal, to investigate her case. Lewis has already confirmed that he is investigating the matter and has described Ms. Stark as a potential victim of a criminal offense. Lewis has also commented on the wider implications of Ms. Stark’s case, pointing out that this is the first known case of the scandal crossing the Atlantic. He has stated that this demonstrates the extent of the unethical and illegal behavior that took place at the News of the World, and that it serves as a warning to other media outlets that such behavior will not be tolerated. The News of the World scandal first came to light in 2011, following allegations that the newspaper had hacked into the voicemail accounts of numerous public figures, including politicians, celebrities, and crime victims. The scandal ultimately led to the closure of the newspaper and the conviction of several individuals involved in the hacking. The new allegations made by Ms. Stark indicate that the scandal may have been more widespread than originally thought, and that the illegal activities may have extended beyond the UK’s borders. It remains to be seen how far-reaching the scandal may be, and how many other victims may come forward in the future. In the meantime, Mark Lewis has emphasized that he will be working tirelessly to investigate Ms. Stark’s case and to hold those responsible for the phone hacking accountable for their actions. He has also urged anyone who believes they may have been a victim of the News of the World phone hacking scandal to come forward and report their experiences.
