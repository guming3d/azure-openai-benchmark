article: MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- Averting what could have been another gas crisis across Europe, Russia and Ukraine have fixed a price on natural gas for 2008 while Kiev has promised to pay its 2007 gas debts. The last-minute deal mirrored a similar situation in 2006, when Russia briefly cut off gas supplies to Ukraine over pricing differences. Ukraine is the largest facilitator of natural gas to European Union countries, and the disruption caused shortages in Western Europe. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine President Viktor Yushchenko announced on Tuesday they had reached agreement on the gas issue at a news conference in Moscow following their talks. The Russian natural gas company, Gazprom, had threatened to stop supplying gas to Ukraine on Monday, then extended the deadline until Tuesday evening while talks continued. The two leaders said several other issues between the countries had been resolved, as well. Yushchenko said Ukraine will pay its gas arrears of 2007 and will be a stable transit supplier to Western Europe. A final agreement will be signed in the next few days and payment for gas already used will begin shortly, Putin said. After the gas cut-off in 2006, EU leaders called for solutions that would allow the union to avoid being a victim of disputes between Russia and other former Soviet republics. A consortium of countries banded together to fund the Nabucco pipeline, a $7.4 billion (5 billion euros) project that will bring gas from Turkey's borders with Georgia and Iran to Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Austria, and then on to Central and Western Europe, according to the Nabucco Web site. Construction is to begin in 2009 on the 3,400-km (2,113-mile) pipeline, and it's expected to be operational in 2013. But Gazprom, along with Italy's ENI, is planning a 900-km (560-mile) pipeline following a similar route to feed into Austria and Italy, a project that would cost between $14.6 billion and $17.5 billion (10 billion to 12 billion euros). Last week, the managing director of Nabucco Gas Pipeline International, Reinhard Mitschek, announced that Gazprom may also send gas through the Nabucco pipeline. Critics say the move would undermine the purpose of the project, which was to reduce European dependence on Russian gas. E-mail to a friend .

chatgpt: In a major breakthrough between Russia and Ukraine, the two nations have come to an agreement on the price of natural gas for the year 2008. The announcement was made at a joint news conference held by the two presidents, Vladimir Putin of Russia and Viktor Yushchenko of Ukraine. The deal comes after weeks of tense negotiations and the threat by state energy giant Gazprom to cut off supplies of gas to Ukraine. The dispute between the two countries over the price of gas has been ongoing for many years, with Ukraine often accusing Russia of using its gas supplies as a political weapon. Under the new agreement, Ukraine will pay $509 per thousand cubic meters of gas in the first quarter of 2008, and $360 per thousand cubic meters for the rest of the year. The price is a compromise between the $179.50 per thousand cubic meters that Ukraine had been paying and the $250 that Russia had been demanding. The deal is a major victory for both countries. For Russia, it secures a steady supply of revenue from gas exports and maintains its position as Europe's largest gas supplier. For Ukraine, it ends the threat of a severe energy crisis, as gas supplies are critical for industry and heating during the harsh winter months. In his remarks at the news conference, President Putin emphasized the importance of the agreement for both countries. "This is not just about prices," he said. "It is about the stability and security of our energy supply. Russia will continue to be a reliable partner for Ukraine and Europe." President Yushchenko thanked Russia for its cooperation in reaching the deal and emphasized the importance of the two countries' relationship. "Russia and Ukraine have a complex history, but we share a common destiny," he said. "This agreement shows that we can work together for the good of both our nations." The news of the agreement was met with relief and optimism by industry experts and European leaders. The European Union, which relies heavily on Russian gas supplies, had been closely monitoring the negotiations and had urged both sides to reach a compromise. In conclusion, the agreement on the price of natural gas between Russia and Ukraine is a significant step forward in the relationship between the two nations. The deal brings stability and security to the energy supply of both countries and secures Russia's position as a reliable partner for Europe.
