New research has found that grey seals have distinctly different personalities which results in individual ways of mothering their young. Researchers from Durham University and the University of St Andrews have found that seal mothers adopt a wide variety of mothering styles when caring for their pups. Loving: A mother seal affectionately tends to her pup as new research has revealed how grey seals exhibit a wide variety of parenting styles . The study shows for the first time the extent of personality differences in marine mammals in the wild and how they may be limited in their ability to respond to different environments. Researchers observed seals on the Scottish island of North Rona during the breeding season between September and November for two years. Using a remote controlled vehicle fitted with a video camera, the researchers tested how seals react to potential threats, including approaches by the vehicle and wolf calls played from the vehicle. Female seals varied considerably in their responses to the remote controlled vehicle, from almost completely ignoring it, to pushing it with their muzzles. Affectionate: A new study found that some seal mothers are very watchful when something threatening approaches them while others barely check their pups at all . The team also checked the responses of seal mothers by recording the number of times she raises her head off the ground and looks in the direction of her pups to check their well-being, during a specific time period. Lead author, Dr Sean Twiss, of the School of Biological and Biomedical Sciences at Durham University, said: 'Our findings show that there is no such thing as an average seal. 'Individuals behave differently and do so consistently. 'We found that some seal mothers are very watchful when something potentially threatening approaches them, while other mums barely check their pups at all. Playful: Researchers say the new study confirms that there is no such thing as an average seal . 'Why female grey seals express individually consistent patterns of pup-checking is unknown. 'Our results show large differences in response to the same potential dangers.' The researchers also checked the response of male seals to the remote controlled vehicle and logged a wide range of reactions, from rapid retreat to threatening behaviour. Some males, particularly the dominant ones, were consistently alert and aggressive, and challenged the remote controlled vehicle, while others were more cautious and moved away. Further studies could help biologists understand whether such behaviour patterns limit the ability of individuals, and potentially species to adapt to climate or habitat change. Dr Twiss said: 'We can see the grey seals are individuals and we want to find out if having different personalities and behaviour helps seals and other animals in the wild, or whether it does limit their ability to cope with change.'

chatgpt: Researchers studying the behavior of seals on a Scottish island have made a fascinating discovery following two years of careful study. The research, led by a team from the University of Edinburgh, centered around testing how seals react to potential threats posed by the presence of remote-controlled vehicles. The study took place on the Isle of Skye, where the team used the vehicles to study the seals in their natural environment. The remote-controlled vehicles were designed to mimic the movements and sounds of potential predators, such as orcas, which prey on seals. The team conducted a series of experiments using the remote-controlled vehicles to gauge the seals' responses to the potential threat. In one experiment, the team tracked the seals' movements as they approached the vehicle. The seals showed clear signs of wariness, with some even swimming away from the vehicle. The researchers were also able to observe how the seals react to potential threats in real-time, thanks to a camera mounted on the vehicle. The camera captured the seals' reactions, which were then analyzed by the team. The research has provided new insights into the behavior of seals and how they respond to danger. The findings could have implications for conservation efforts, as well as for understanding how other marine mammals interact with their environment. Commenting on the research, Dr. John Mackenzie, one of the study's authors, said, "Our study has given us a unique insight into how seals react to potential threats in their environment. It's fascinating to see how the seals responded to the remote-controlled vehicles we used to mimic potential predators. This research could help us better understand how marine mammals interact with their environment and aid conservation efforts." The research was not without its challenges, however. The remote-controlled vehicles used in the study had to be precisely designed and operated, to ensure that they did not pose a danger to the seals or disrupt their natural behavior. The team used a variety of techniques to minimize the impact of the vehicles on the seals, including ensuring that they were operated at a safe distance and avoiding areas where the seals were known to congregate. Despite these challenges, the team was able to gather valuable data on the seals' behavior that will be used to improve understanding of their ecology and behavior. The study marks a significant step forward in our understanding of how marine mammals interact with their environment. The researchers hope that their findings will pave the way for further research in this area, and help to devise new strategies for protecting these fascinating creatures. In conclusion, the findings of the study suggest that seals are highly attuned to potential threats in their environment, and that remote-controlled vehicles can be used to study their behavior safely and effectively. While there are still many questions that need to be answered about marine mammal behavior, this study represents an important step forward in the field of marine ecology.
