'It’s a good job Gavin wasn’t going to Blackpool or he’d have probably ended up with a hot dog. 'When I first saw her in there I thought she was bound to be injured or badly burned - but, apart from being covered in oil and a bit shaky, she was fine.

'It’s not the smallest dog and I still can’t quite work out how it managed to get itself there. It’s absolutely bizarre. 'I still don’t get how it survived, with the heat in there and the fan spinning, but I’m just glad for Gary and his family it was a happy ending.'

The incident as reported by the dog’s owner, Gary James, started when he inadvertently left the garden gate open.

The dog had apparently found itself stuck in the engine of Juliette's car. Even more bizarre was the fact that Juliette had driven nearly 12 miles with the terrified pet still stuck under the bonnet. It was a stroke of luck that they even discovered the dog as both men had been driving around together for nearly two hours with no clue of the dog’s whereabouts.

Once they stopped the car, they wasted no time in getting to the bottom of the problem. They had to take the engine apart to free the distressed animal.
