In jail for late library books: Jory Enck was locked up after he failed to return a study guide he borrowed in 2010 . They take law breaking seriously in the town of Copperas Cove, Texas, where police are regularly arresting people who do not return their library books on time. The latest to be locked up for the offence had a book checked out for three years. Jory Enck was booked into jail for overdue library materials. Court documents show he checked out a study guide in 2010 and didn't respond to attempts from the library to get the book back. City of Copperas Cove Municipal Judge Bill Price said the patrons are usually released on a £150 ($240) bond after the arrest. Library policies show the patron must have the overdue book checked out for a minimum of 90 days and not respond to phone calls or emails from the library about the book before the municipal court is notified. Julie Lehmann with the Copperas Cove Police Department said if an officer makes a routine stop or encounters a patron with an active overdue library materials warrant on a call they will make the arrest. Judge Price said in situations where library materials are not returned they usually try to let the civil process sort it out and if that doesn't work a warrant is issued, which doesn't result in a pleasant response from patrons. Judge Price said: 'Universal hatred, nobody wants to get arrested over a library book. 'The other side of that is people that go to our library and can't have these materials, they're put out too.' Take law breaking seriously: Police regularly arrest people who do not return their library books on time in the town of Copperas Cove, Texas (pictured) The ordinance was adopted by the city almost four years ago and some locals are not happy with the library warrants being regularly issued. Copperas Cove resident Clyde Glosson said: 'I guess that they have to have some way to enforce the rules at the library to return borrowed material. 'I think that's a little extreme personally and I'll certainly talk to the mayor to maybe get that changed.' Enck's library card was found inside the book now back at the library with records showing the book was turned in the day after his arrest. Ignore library warnings: The overdue book must be out for a minimum of 90 days and the library must have made attempts to contact the borrower before the municipal court in Copperas Cove (pictured) is notified .

chatgpt: Copperas Cove, a small town in Texas, has been hitting headlines for its unusual practice of arresting patrons who fail to return their library books on time. According to reports, local police have been regularly making arrests for unreturned library books, which seems to be more of a routine affair in the town. The practice, which is unheard of in many parts of the world, has raised a lot of concerns among locals and visitors alike. Arrested patrons usually have to pay a bond of £150 ($240) to secure their release. While some consider the fine exorbitant, others find the arrest itself unnecessary for what seems like a minor offence. It appears that the harsh measures have been put in place as a means of deterring borrowers from keeping books for longer than necessary. According to the library's policy, a book must be out for a minimum of 90 days before the borrower is notified. If the book is not returned after several attempts have been made to contact the borrower, the courts are eventually notified. While some say the police's intervention is excessive, others argue that it is a necessary measure to maintain the integrity of the library's collection. In an interview with a local news outlet, a spokesperson for the Copperas Cove Police Department defended their actions, stating that their approach is in line with the library's policy, and they only intervene after all other attempts to recover the book have failed. "It's not about the money, it's about the principle," the spokesperson said. "When you borrow a book, you're essentially making a promise to return it in a timely manner. The library's policy is in place to ensure that everyone has equal access to their collection. When people fail to return their books, they're denying others that opportunity." While many may find the practice excessive, some have voiced their support for the library's policy. "It's not fair for people to keep books for months on end, denying others the chance to read them," said a local resident. "If the threat of arrest is what it takes to get these books back, then so be it." However, not everyone is convinced that the policy is effective. Some have accused the library of being too rigid and suggested that finding ways to encourage borrowers to return books voluntarily would be a better approach. For now, it appears that Copperas Cove's policy on unreturned library books will remain in place. While many may question the necessity of such harsh measures, it seems that the town's authorities are willing to take a tough stance to ensure that their collection is not denied to those who are eager to read it.
