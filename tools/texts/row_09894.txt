article: Miami (CNN) -- After weeks on the run and days in immigration detention, American technology pioneer John McAfee arrived in Miami on Wednesday. He said he had no choice in the matter, that Guatemalan authorities expelled him to the United States and put him on a plane to a destination they determined. "I was whisked out of prison," McAfee told CNN affiliate broadcaster WSVN in front of his South Beach hotel. "I was forcibly separated from Samantha, and now here I am." Samantha Venegas is McAfee's girlfriend. When the plane landed, U.S. officials boarded the aircraft to greet him and escort him off. Former girlfriend: McAfee 'frightened for his life' It was unclear whether he planned to stay in Miami or where he might go next. For the past week, McAfee waged a public battle, requesting an asylum in Guatemala and arguing that police in Belize were persecuting him. Authorities turned down his request and told him he would have to leave the country. "He opted to return to his country of origin," said attorney Telesforo Guerra, who has represented McAfee since he arrived in Guatemala last week. Authorities in Belize, where McAfee had lived since 2008, say they want to talk to McAfee about the November 11 killing of his neighbor, American businessman Gregory Faull. McAfee said he had nothing to do with the death and insists he left Belize to escape police persecution. Guatemalan authorities took him into custody on accusations of entering the country illegally, and his asylum bid was rejected. McAfee told WSVN he has openly criticized Belize's government for seven months, making himself a "thorn in their side." "Unfortunately, now that I'm here, they can't shut me up," he said. CNN en EspaÃ±ol's Adriana Hauser reported from Miami. CNN's Joe Sutton and Ana maria Luengo-Romero reported from Atlanta. Journalist Miguel Salay reported from Guatemala City.

chatgpt: John McAfee, the software company founder whose turbulent escapades in Central America have made headlines, has spoken out about his recent deportation to the United States. Speaking at a press conference in Miami, McAfee stated that he had "no choice" but to head back to the US, following his detention in Guatemala. McAfee had been on the run from police in Belize, where he was wanted for questioning in connection with the murder of a local businessman. After fleeing to Guatemala, he was arrested for entering the country illegally, and subsequently applied for asylum. However, his application was rejected by Guatemalan officials, who deemed his case to be groundless. At the press conference, McAfee's lawyer emphasized that his client had not been deported from Guatemala voluntarily. Rather, he had been "escorted" back to the US with the help of American officials. However, the lawyer also noted that McAfee's return to the US was not necessarily permanent, and that he could return to Central America at some point in the future. For his part, McAfee seemed determined to continue his campaign against the Belizean government, which he has accused of corruption and human rights abuses. He pledged to keep speaking out and exposing what he sees as the truth about Belize, no matter where he may be. While the controversy surrounding McAfee's case has been fascinating to many, it has also raised serious questions about the power dynamics at play in Central America. Some have criticized the US government for its apparent involvement in McAfee's return, suggesting that this represents a worrying new trend of interventionism in the region. Regardless of what happens next, it seems clear that John McAfee's story is far from over. With his dramatic flight from Belize, his eventful stay in Guatemala, and now his controversial return to the US, McAfee has certainly made his presence felt on the international stage. And with his ongoing determination to speak out against alleged corruption and wrongdoing, it seems likely that we'll be hearing more from him in the months and years to come.
