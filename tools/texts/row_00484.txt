article: (CNN) -- A federal appeals court Thursday reinstated a key part of a new Texas abortion law, considered to be among the most restrictive in the country. The decision came three days after a federal judge struck down the provision, which requires doctors to obtain admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic at which they're providing abortion services. A day before parts of the law were scheduled to take effect, U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel on Monday issued an injunction blocking the law's admitting privileges requirement, arguing that it "places a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus and is thus an undue burden to her." Thursday's decision means the requirement will remain in place while a lawsuit moves forward. The lawsuit -- filed in U.S. District Court in Austin by Planned Parenthood on behalf of more than a dozen women's health care providers across Texas -- alleged the state's new abortion law violates the constitutional rights of women and puts unreasonable demands on doctors who perform abortions. In a statement, Planned Parenthood Federation of America said the requirement that doctors have admitting privileges is expected to cause at least one-third of the state's licensed health centers that provide abortion services to stop. "While we acknowledge that Planned Parenthood has also made a strong showing that their interests would be harmed by staying the injunction, given the State's likely success on the merits, this is not enough, standing alone, to outweigh the other factors," read a part of Thursday's 20-page ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The bill originally failed to gain approval because of a Democratic filibuster led by state Sen. Wendy Davis. Gov. Rick Perry then called the Legislature into a second special session to continue consideration of the bill. "This fight is far from over. This restriction clearly violates Texas women's constitutional rights by drastically reducing access to safe and legal abortion statewide," said Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood. "If Texans showed America one thing during the historic protests against this law this summer, we demonstrated that Texans value women's health â€” and that is why we will take every step we can to protect the health of Texas women in the wake of this ruling," she said. Perry cheered the ruling. "Today's decision affirms our right to protect both the unborn and the health of the women of Texas. We will continue doing everything we can to protect a culture of life in our state," he said in a statement. CNN's Cristy Lenz contributed to this report.

chatgpt: In a pledge to protect the sanctity of human life, Texas Governor Rick Perry recently addressed concerns over a judge's blockage of a newly introduced Texas abortion law. The bill was designed to require abortion providers to obtain admitting privileges at nearby hospitals in order to offer their services. Governor Perry has stated that he and his administration will "do everything we can to protect a culture of life" in Texas in the face of opposition to the bill. On Monday, a judge blocked the admitting privileges requirement portion of the bill from being enforced due to concerns over how it could affect the availability of abortion services. Governor Perry has expressed his disappointment and frustration with this ruling, but remains unwavering in his commitment to protecting the rights of the unborn. "We will continue to fight for the safety of Texas women and their unborn children," he said in a statement issued after the ruling. Abortion-rights activists, on the other hand, view the court's decision as a major victory in their ongoing struggle to safeguard access to safe and legal abortion services. "This fight is far from over," said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights. "We will continue to stand up for the rights of women in Texas and across the country to make their own reproductive decisions without interference from politicians." The bill, which was originally introduced during a special legislative session in June, failed to gain approval due to a Democratic filibuster led by State Senator Wendy Davis, who gained national recognition for her marathon speech on the Senate floor opposing the measure. However, Governor Perry called another special session earlier this month to reintroduce the bill, along with other controversial measures such as new voting restrictions and changes to school funding. The new version of the bill passed both the Texas House and Senate, with supporters arguing that the additional safety requirements were necessary to protect women who undergo abortions. However, opponents argued that the real goal of the legislation was to make it more difficult for women to obtain abortions, particularly in rural areas where there are fewer providers who may struggle to meet the new requirements. The court's decision to block the bill's admitting privileges requirement is a significant blow to Governor Perry and other proponents of the measure, but the battle over abortion rights in Texas is far from over. With both sides remaining fiercely committed to their positions, it is likely that we will continue to see fierce debate and legal wrangling over this issue for years to come.
