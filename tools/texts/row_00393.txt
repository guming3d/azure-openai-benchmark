No laughing matter: In an interview with Radio Times, comedian Barry Cryer has criticised today's 'homophobic' and 'unbeleivable' sitcoms . Comedian Barry Cryer has criticised today's sitcoms for lacking believable characters and claims that modern comedy writing is 'no laughing matter'. Mr Cryer, 79, said that writers had forgotten how to create people who viewers could identify with and wrongly focused on making jokes. In an interview with Radio Times magazine, Mr Cryer said that sitcom writing has 'gone back at least 30 years' in its current format. Criticising current shows such as ITV1's Vicious, starring Sir Ian McKellan, he said: 'We're living in an era of back-to-basics sitcoms and it's no laughing matter. 'From Vicious to Mrs Brown's Boys to The Wright Way, the old-fashioned situation comedy is suddenly all the rage again. 'It's a serious business writing comedy. You don't necessarily need funny lines all the time. 'The key is to create characters. Characters people can identify with. But right now we've gone back at least 30 years in terms of format.' Cryer, who penned jokes for the likes of Tommy Cooper, Les Dawson, and Morecambe and Wise, said that ITV sitcom Vicious, about a bickering gay couple, should have been 'fantastic' thanks to 'two great actors' in Sir Ian McKellen and Sir Derek Jacobi. But instead he said that the sitcom is 'homophobic'. He told the magazine: 'But it was insult, insult, insult every other line. You don't believe in them. You don't like them, for a start. 'It was positively homophobic. It made John Inman look restrained.' Criticism: Barry Cryer is not a fan of ITV1's Vicious which is 'an insult' despite starring 'two great actors' in Sir Ian McKellan, left, and Derek Jacobi, right . Not a fan: Mr Cryer claims that comedies like Mrs Brown's Boys, pictured, have taken comedy 'back to basics' Impressed: Miranda is one of the few comedies singled out for praise by Barry Cryer . He added: 'The great sitcom writers of the past didn't think jokes were remotely important. Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, who wrote Hancock's Half Hour and Steptoe and Son, knew that instinctively. 'Johnny Speight who created Alf Garnett never did jokes; he just wrote great characters. And for immaculate writing it would be hard to beat Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais's Porridge. 'That show had a great gallery of characters and not a duff moment in any episode. That's it. Great characters trapped in a situation.' The I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue panellist said that he rated BBC1 sitcom Miranda and the second series of Rev. He added: 'We will laugh again soon...It's straightforward stuff: character, character, character. You don't need jokes, you don't need funny lines. 'The humour will come because the secret to the truly funny sitcoms is simple - they are basically all about life.'

chatgpt: Veteran comedian Mr. Barry Cryer, who has worked in the industry for over 60 years, has criticized contemporary sitcom writing, stating that it has taken a backseat of 30 years. In an interview with a news website, the legendary comic claimed that writers today have forgotten how to create realistic characters. According to him, the quality of sitcoms has significantly deteriorated because of a lack of character realism. As an experienced comedian and writer, Mr. Cryer has an insight into the industry that many others do not. He worked on some of the most beloved television shows of yesteryear, including "The Two Ronnies", "I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue", and "Just a Minute". He described the current state of sitcoms as "an insult." He believes that the industry is not producing great comedy, as it did in the past. Sitcoms of the past were not just about making people laugh, but they also had a great touch of realism to them. The comedian, who is 79 years old now, does not believe sitcoms have the same panache in the modern era. He believes that writers are not putting as much thought into character development as they should. He went on to say that writers do not focus on creating "real people" anymore, adding that "they're not looking at human beings." Cryer pointed out a specific example of this degradation in quality in his mention of the 2013 sitcom Vicious. Starring Sir Ian McKellen and Sir Derek Jacobi, the show centers around an elderly gay couple. Mr. Cryer called the show "an insult" and stated that it was "all caricature, no character." The veteran writer's opinion sparks a debate about the quality of writing and the use of cheap laughs. Many people have compared modern sitcoms with the classic comedies of the past, such as "The Two Ronnies" and "Porridge." The shows of the past are still frequently aired on classic TV channels, and the new generation of viewers find them entertaining. It is undoubtedly true that the quality of sitcom writing has suffered in recent years. The focus has shifted from character development to cheap laughs. However, it remains to be seen whether this trend will continue or if someone like Mr. Cryer will step in and bring realism and genuine humor back to the small screen. In conclusion, Mr. Cryer's views on the quality of contemporary sitcom writing should be taken seriously. He has vast experience in the industry and has contributed to some great innovative ideas that have left a lasting impact on comedy fans. The industry needs to listen to people like him and make an effort to produce sitcoms of great quality.
