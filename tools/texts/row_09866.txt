article: (CNN) -- Bionic engineering -- long the subject of science fiction novels and Hollywood blockbusters -- is now helping paraplegics make walking a reality. The so-called Ekso, a mechanical skeleton created by California-based company Ekso Bionics, is designed to give paraplegics the power to walk unaided. The innovation mean the power of bionics, which inspired the hit movie Iron Man and the television series The Six Million Dollar Man, is becoming reality. Suzanne Edwards, who suffered a spinal chord injury that left her wheelchair-bound, has used the Ekso and told CNN it was an "amazing feeling." Edwards said, "to be told you are never going to walk again, and then to be up and walking so quickly and easily in this -- and it feels so natural and normal -- you know you can't really fault it." Ekso Bionics chief executive Eythor Bender and his team developed the robotic model to help wheelchair users and those who have suffered spinal chord injuries. The mechanical skeleton is a ready-to-wear, battery-powered outfit that is strapped over the user's clothing and responds to a control panel. The company also offers assistance for the more able-bodied. "We are working with soldiers -- the most able-bodied -- to carry more weight and reduce back injuries," Bender said. "Then there is everyone in between that [who] need power," he added. "Construction workers need to hold tools to become more productive, and you and me might want to climb Kilimanjaro and need extra power from a bionic leg," he said. The developments of Ekso Bionics are funded through private investments and government grants. The company is also targeting the medical industry. It has sold 16 devices to rehabilitation centers and hospitals in the U.S. The company expects that to rise to 45 by the end of 2012. In Europe, they expect to deliver up to 20 suits this year. The exo-skeleton costs $130,000 -- but Bender believes this is a small price to pay. "It's a high cost but considering you are helping people walk again, I think it is pretty cheap," he said.

chatgpt: Ekso Bionics, a leading company in the field of exoskeleton technology, has launched a revolutionary device designed to offer hope to people suffering from paralysis. The robotic suit, which the company has dubbed the "Ekso," offers an unprecedented level of freedom and mobility to paraplegics, allowing them to walk unaided. The Ekso is a battery-powered suit that is strapped over the user's clothing. Its metallic skeleton supports the wearer's legs and allows them to take steps, while sensors and motors adjust the suit's movements to the user's natural gait. The device weighs only 65 pounds, making it easy to maneuver, and can be adjusted to fit a range of body types. According to the company, the Ekso has already received a warm welcome from those who have tried it. In initial trials, paraplegics using the suit were able to walk across a room and climb stairs with ease. The device has also reportedly helped to improve users' psychological well-being, providing a sense of independence and liberation. Ekso Bionics has ambitious plans for the suit, with hopes to sell up to 45 units in the U.S. by the end of 2012. While the Ekso currently only offers mobility for those with paralysis below the waist, the company is working on developing a full-body suit that will offer assistance and freedom of movement for individuals with a range of disabilities. The Ekso represents a significant advancement in exoskeleton technology, which has long been a subject of fascination in the fields of science and engineering. While previous devices have been hampered by their size and complexity, the Ekso offers a lightweight and user-friendly alternative that could transform the lives of millions of people worldwide. The device has already been praised by medical professionals and disability advocates, who see it as a game-changer for those suffering from paralysis. The Ekso could help to restore independence and freedom of movement to people who have been previously reliant on wheelchairs or other assistive devices. In conclusion, the Ekso represents a major breakthrough in exoskeleton technology and could provide renewed hope and mobility to millions of people around the world. Its lightweight and user-friendly design, coupled with its ability to assist paraplegics in walking unaided, make it a promising solution for those with paralysis. With plans to expand its range of applications, Ekso Bionics is poised to make a significant impact in the field of assistive technology.
