In 2019, a couple from Texas gave birth to their daughter on 9/19/19 at 19:19, which is a sequence of numbers that will never repeat in their lifetime. In 2018, a mother in Arizona gave birth to a baby girl in a Starbucks restroom, and the coffee chain offered the family $1,000 worth of free coffee for a year. Despite the excitement surrounding these unique birth stories, parents often highlight the importance of the health of the mother and the babies as the most important factor. Atherton said, "We are just grateful that the girls are healthy and happy."
