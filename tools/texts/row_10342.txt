chatgpt: The family of Eunice Williams, who was admitted to Wrexham Maelor Hospital, expressed their anger and frustration as their loved one suffered from severe cold during her hospital stay, despite providing warm clothing. Williams was admitted to the hospital for a routine procedure, but the cold atmosphere almost resulted in her developing hypothermia. Several members of the Williams family visited the hospital during her stay and noticed that the ward was significantly colder than usual. They had provided clothes suitable for the cold weather, but the frigid temperatures of the ward made it difficult for Williams to stay warm. The hospital staff did provide some blankets, but this was not enough to combat the cold. In response to the family’s complaints, Wrexham Maelor Hospital issued an apology to the Williams family. The hospital admitted that the ward’s heating system had malfunctioned during Williams’ stay, resulting in the cold environment. Hospital management added that while the fault was being rectified, temporary heaters were provided to warm the ward.  However, the Williams family still feel that the hospital staff could have done more to ensure their loved one's comfort during her stay. They have called on the hospital management to take the necessary steps to ensure that such incidents are not repeated in the future. Speaking to local media, a family spokesperson said, "We are grateful for the apology from the hospital authorities. However, this incident has left a bad taste in our mouths.

We hope that the hospital management takes this incident seriously and takes steps to prevent a repeat of this unfortunate episode." Hospital management has stated that they will be conducting an investigation into the incident to determine the cause and to put in place measures to prevent a recurrence. They have assured the Williams family that they will be kept informed of the outcome of the investigation.
