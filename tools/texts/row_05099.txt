Rights: Sudanese Amira Osman Hamed faces a possible whipping if she is found guilty in court after refusing to cover her hair . A Sudanese woman who is prepared to be flogged to defend the right to leave her hair uncovered in defiance of a 'Taliban-like' law has appeared in court. Amira Osman Hamed faces a possible whipping if convicted. Under Sudanese law her hair - and that of all women - is supposed to be covered with a 'hijab' but Hamed, 35, refuses to wear one. Her case has drawn support from civil rights activists and is the latest to highlight Sudan's series of laws governing morality which took effect after the 1989 Islamist-backed coup by President Omar al-Bashir. Her . lawyer Moezz Hadhra told AFP said: 'The defence asked the court that . the charges against this woman be withdrawn, and the court adjourned the hearing until October 4 while it considers the request.' In an interview earlier this month, she said: 'They want us to be like Taliban women.' She is charged under Article 152 which prohibits 'indecent' clothing. Hamed said she was visiting a government office in Jebel Aulia, just outside Khartoum, on August 27, when a policeman aggressively told her to cover her head. Hamed, a divorced computer engineer who runs her own company, said: 'This public order law changed Sudanese women from victims to criminals. 'This law is targeting the dignity of Sudanese people.'

chatgpt: Amira Osman Hamed, a Sudanese woman, faces a possible punishment of whipping if she is convicted. The 35-year-old's case has been adjourned until October 4 by a court in Khartoum. Under Sudanese law, it is mandatory for women to cover their hair with a "hijab" in public settings. However, Ms. Hamed was arrested for not adhering to this law. Ms. Hamed had appeared in court in a long black robe, but with her hair uncovered. She argued that the requirement to wear a hijab was not a public order offence, so she wasn't breaking any laws. The judge, however, disagreed with her argument and reminded her that not wearing a hijab can be punished by flogging according to Sudan's interpretation of Islamic law. The case has now garnered international attention, with many human rights activists and organizations condemning the authorities' approach towards women's rights in Sudan. They argue that the punishment for not wearing a hijab is a violation of basic human rights. Sudanese society is traditionally conservative, and women often face restrictions in their daily lives. While the country's constitution guarantees the freedom of religion, the authorities have consistently enforced conservative interpretations of Islam in public life. Rights groups claim that such restrictions are part of a larger pattern of discrimination and violations of civil liberties in Sudan. They argue that the government should promote freedom of expression, including the right of women to choose whether or not to wear a hijab, rather than enforcing gender-based dress codes. Cases like this one spark a discussion about laws in some Muslim-majority countries, which some argue are sexist, patriarchal, and outdated. Activists say that these laws infringe upon basic rights and freedoms, including the right to freedom of expression and conscience. Ms. Hamed's case has now been adjourned until October 4. Until then, her fate remains uncertain, and it is unclear whether she will be punished for not covering her hair with a hijab. The case raises fundamental questions about the role of the state in regulating personal and religious expression, as well as the balance between secularism and religion.
