chatgpt: Leicester City Football Club has been dealt a significant setback with the news that their goalkeeper, Kasper Schmeichel, will be out of action for approximately four weeks. The injury occurred during a training session on Thursday morning when the Danish international broke his metatarsal. Schmeichel has been a stalwart for the club in recent seasons and has played a key role in their success. The 34-year-old has been with Leicester City since 2011 and has been a regular in their starting lineup since his arrival. He has also been a vital part of the Danish national team and played a key role in his country's journey to the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup. The loss of Schmeichel could prove to be a significant blow to Leicester City as they currently sit in 17th place in the Premier League standings. The Foxes have struggled for form this season, having won just two of their opening nine league games. They will now have to rely on their backup goalkeeper, Danny Ward, to fill the void left by Schmeichel. Ward has been with Leicester City since 2018 and has made just eight appearances for the club. The Welsh international will now have the opportunity to prove himself and stake his claim for a regular starting position. Leicester City has a tough run of fixtures coming up, with games against Liverpool, Burnley, and Brighton & Hove Albion in the next few weeks. The Foxes will need to be at their best if they are to pick up points in these games and avoid being dragged into the relegation zone. The loss of Schmeichel will undoubtedly be a huge blow for the club, but they will need to rally around and show their fighting spirit in the coming weeks. With Ward stepping up to the challenge, Leicester City will be hoping to get back to winning ways and climb up the league table as quickly as possible. In conclusion, Leicester City has been hit with the news that Kasper Schmeichel will be out of action for four weeks. The goalkeeper's injury comes at a crucial time for the club and will undoubtedly be a significant blow. The Foxes will need to rally around and show their fighting spirit to ensure that they do not slip further down the Premier League standings.
