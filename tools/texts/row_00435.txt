article: Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- The mother of Kristi Cornwell, whose remains were discovered nearly a year and a half after she disappeared, said on Monday she is thankful to finally be able to bring her daughter home. "We didn't want it to end this way, but that's the way it is. And we can bring her home now," said Jo Ann Cornwell, fighting back tears. "I know in my heart she's in heaven and we'll see her again." She spoke the same day authorities said tests conducted on bones found in Georgia revealed they are Kristi Cornwell's remains. The positive identification was made through dental records, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said in a statement. Kristi Cornwell, 38, was last seen walking along a road in northern Georgia the night of August 11, 2009. Her brother, acting off a tip from the bureau, found the remains Saturday in a wooded area about 9 miles from where she was last seen. The site where the bones were discovered is in Union County, in far northern Georgia. Investigators believe Cornwell's disappearance could be related to a December 2009 incident in Ranger, North Carolina, in which a woman was attacked by a man driving a late model Nissan Xterra, the GBI said. In April, investigators were led to the home of 42-year-old James Scott Carringer, who was suspected of rape in Gilmer County, Georgia. Carringer, who killed himself as police tried to arrest him on the rape charges, also owned a silver Xterra and was originally from Brasstown, North Carolina, not far from Ranger, the GBI said. Beyond those details, the bureau did not specify why investigators believe the two cases are linked. "Because we have no direct evidence, this will remain an active and open investigation at GBI. We are still pursuing investigative leads as they relate to Carringer," said GBI Director Vernon Keenan. He said investigators were led to the area where Kristi's remains were discovered by cell phone records that indicated Carringer had been nearby the night she disappeared. "We believe that he was a career criminal and we do not know how much harm he has done," said Keenan. Last summer, on the one-year anniversary of Cornwell's disappearance, the GBI said it had conducted interviews at 450 houses in the Union County area, and that its file on the case had grown to 40 volumes. CNN's Tina Burnside contributed to this report.

chatgpt: In a tragic turn of events, the brother of Kristi Cornwell discovered her remains in a location approximately nine miles away from where she was last seen. Cornwell, who had been missing since August 2009, was positively identified through dental records after her brother found the bones. Cornwell's mother, who had spent over a decade waiting for answers, expressed her grief and relief at finally finding closure. "I know in my heart she's in heaven," she said, "and I'm happy to finally bring her home." Cornwell, a 38-year-old mother-of-two, had been out walking and talking on her cell phone with her boyfriend when she was abducted. Her disappearance had sparked a massive search effort, including volunteers, law enforcement agencies, and the FBI. Despite extensive efforts, no trace of Cornwell had been found until her brother stumbled upon her remains. The discovery has provided much-needed answers for Cornwell's family and loved ones, who have been coping with her disappearance for more than a decade. The investigation into Cornwell's death is ongoing, and law enforcement officials hope to find the person or persons responsible for her abduction and murder. While the discovery of her remains provides a glimmer of closure, there is still much work to be done to bring those responsible to justice. Cornwell's story is a reminder of the importance of remaining vigilant and aware of our surroundings, even in seemingly safe areas. Her disappearance captured the attention of the nation, and her family's tireless search for answers touched the hearts of many. As we reflect on this tragic event, we should honor Cornwell's memory by remaining vigilant and doing our best to keep ourselves and our loved ones safe. While we cannot always control the actions of others, we can take steps to protect ourselves and remain aware of potential dangers. The discovery of Kristi Cornwell's remains marks the end of a long and difficult chapter for her family and loved ones. While they have finally found the closure they were seeking, their journey towards healing and justice is far from over. We can only hope that the investigation into her death will lead to the answers they need and that the person or persons responsible will be brought to justice.
