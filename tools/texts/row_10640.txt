article: Many people might associate roses with romance novels, but in fact the smell of chocolate tempts readers to buy loved-up fiction. Researchers at Antwerp University in Belgium found that while a chocolatey smell makes people hungry to buy romance novels, it does not necessarily tempt people to buy grittier genres such as crime or business books. The scientists, who permeated a bookshop with the perfume of chocolate, also found that the scent encouraged customers to browse through titles. The government funded study found that bookshop visitors were almost six times more likely to buy a romance novel if they smelt chocolate - and the same results applied to cookery books too . They studied the behaviour of 201 customers in a popular chain bookshop over ten days to find that customers were 3.5 times more likely to pick up romance novels when they smelt chocolate, The Guardian reported. The government funded study also found that bookshop visitors were almost six times more likely to buy a romance novel - and the same results applied to cookery books too. Belgium scientists found the smell of chocolate makes people buy romance books written by novelists such as Dame Barbara Cartland (pictured) Lieve Douché, who led the study told the newspaper: 'When consumers smell chocolate, concepts . associated with chocolate, such as cooking, become more readily . accessible to the consumer's mind and cause consumers to react . differently when encountering a cookbook than if they had not smelled . chocolate.' The researchers concluded romance, food and drink books were strongly linked with the smell of chocolate, but other categories of literature were not, such as comic and graphic novels, travel, art, gardening, crime, law and business books. However, perhaps sue to the scent encouraging customers to browse and deviate from their usual purchasing habits, sales of the 'incongruent' books also increased, with customers 1.2 times more likely to buy any of the books on offer in the chain bookshop. Previous research has found that the smell of chocolate has a positive effect on a person's mood, sparking feelings of pleasure or even arousal when shopping for goods. The Belgium study said: 'The presence of a chocolate scent has a . positive influence on general approach behaviour and a negative impact . on goal-directed behaviour in the store.' Retail experts already exploit customers' sense of smell to influence their attention span and buying behaviour. The new research has taken it a step further by marrying a specific scent with products - even if the books themselves do not have a distinctive smell.

chatgpt: In a bid to find out if scents influence consumer behavior, Belgian scientists flooded a local bookshop with a chocolatey smell to see if it would enhance book sales. The study, which was funded by the government, focused on finding out if the scent of chocolate would encourage customers to buy more books, especially romance novels. The researchers from Antwerp University inundated the store with the sweet aroma, and the results of the experiment were astonishing. The scent encouraged people to spend more time browsing in the bookshop, and they were almost six times more likely to purchase a romance novel than they were before the scent was introduced. However, the study showed that the presence of the chocolate scent did not have a significant effect on making customers want to buy other genres of books such as crime, travel, business, or comics. This result means that the scent of chocolate only has a minimal impact on people’s desire to buy other book types. Despite this finding, the experiment did show a noticeable increase in the sales of all genres of books within the store. The sweet smell encouraged people to spend more time browsing the shelves, which ultimately led to more books being sold overall. The researchers concluded that adding a chocolatey scent to bookshops could be beneficial in terms of sales, particularly when it comes to romance novels. They believe that the sweet aroma creates a more appealing environment, which encourages customers to stay longer in the shop and, subsequently, buy more books. The study has led to speculation about the potential use of scent marketing, which involves using fragrances to influence consumer behavior. While scents have been used to alter customer perceptions for some time, the Belgian experiment highlights the level of impact that a particular fragrance can have. The results of this study have implications not only for bookshops but for other retail outlets also. It could lead to brands using fragrances in their stores as a way of enhancing the customer experience and encouraging a longer browsing time, ultimately leading to more sales. Although there is still much research to be done in understanding the full extent of scent marketing’s potential, the Belgian study has certainly highlighted the benefits of using fragrances in retail outlets. It is an exciting time for marketers as they explore how the sense of smell can be used to create a more memorable customer experience.
