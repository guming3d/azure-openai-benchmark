chatgpt: Last April, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge made their way down under for a tour of Australia with their then eight-month-old son, Prince George. The tour, which lasted 10 days, was a whirlwind for the royal trio, but it came at a cost. According to official documents released by the Australian government, the tour cost taxpayers a total of $474,137. While that might seem like a hefty sum, it's actually less than one fifth of what the Queen's trip to Australia in 2011 cost, which came in at a staggering $2,688,819. The majority of the money spent on the trip went towards transportation, with $87,768 spent on airfares alone. The security detail for the royal couple also cost a considerable amount, with $47,801 going towards protecting the young family. Despite the cost, the trip was seen as a success by many. The Duke and Duchess visited various parts of the country, from the iconic Uluru in the heart of the Outback to the bustling city of Sydney. Throughout their travels, they met with various groups and organizations, highlighting pressing issues such as mental health and conservation efforts. During their visit, the Duke and Duchess also made a stop in New Zealand, where they were met with equal enthusiasm by the locals. The tour was seen as a way to strengthen the bond between the two Commonwealth countries, and it's been praised as a positive step forward in that regard. Of course, it wasn't just Kate and William who made an impression on the public during the trip - their son Prince George also stole the show. The young prince was present for many of the official engagements, and his adorable antics won over hearts around the world. One particular image of George playing with toys during an event in Wellington quickly went viral, earning him the nickname "the Republican Slayer" by some. Overall, the tour was seen as a resounding success for the young family. While the cost may seem high, it's important to consider the impact that the trip had on both the royal family and their hosts in Australia and New Zealand. As such, many believe that the cost was well worth it in the end.
