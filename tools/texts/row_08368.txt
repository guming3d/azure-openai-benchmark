article: By . Gerard Couzens . Two British tourists have been arrested in Portugal after allegedly hiring a firm to kidnap them during a 40th birthday party. Police raced into action after receiving a string of 999 calls about an abduction in Lisbon's Restauradores Square. Terrified callers told police they had seen masked men forcing two women into a white van. Several police vehicles were sent to the scene and began to chase the van. However, when they stopped it, the two women turned out to be thrill-seekers who had paid to be kidnapped for their birthday celebrations. Held: Two British tourists have been arrested in Lisbon, Portugal,  after allegedly hiring a firm to kidnap them during a 40th birthday party . The pair were arrested along with four Portuguese nationals - the owner of the unnamed company and three other men involved in the pretend abduction. Police have confiscated the vehicle used in the fake kidnap and a video used to film the experience. Those arrested were due to appear in court in Lisbon yesterday on suspicion of criminal simulation, a crime which carries a maximum one-year prison sentence. None of the six detainees have been named. The bizarre incident occurred around 15.30pm on Sunday at Restauradores Square in Lisbon city centre. The square is dedicated to the restoration of the independence of Portugal in 1640 after 60 years of Spanish domination. Hit: The incident is remarkably similar to the storyline in hit film The Game, starring Michael Douglas . The four men and two Brits police arrested are aged between 27 and 40.The women are thought to have flown to Portugal with a group of nine friends to celebrate their 40th birthdays. A police source said: 'The incident provoked social alarm and terrified several passers-by at the scene.' Extreme kidnapping is the latest thrill for adrenaline junkies. People can pay up to £1,000 to be abducted and tortured. Customers of French firm Ultime Realite - which is completely unconnected to this incident -  can buy a basic abduction package in which they are seized by strangers, bundled into a car bound and gagged, and kept in a dark cellar for hours. Boat chases and helicopter escapes can be added to the tailor-made experience. Customers explain what they want and once the scenario is established, they sign a contract and liability waiver, but have no idea exactly when or where their abductors will strike. The company's website promises: 'You will go through the real sensations of violence, terror and fear of a real kidnapping - a psychological shock that you won't forget in a hurry.' The incident is remarkably similar to the 1997 thriller The Game starring Michael Douglas, in which the protagonist is trapped in a real-life 'game' organised by a shadowy group called Consumer Recreation Services.

chatgpt: A bizarre incident unfolded in Lisbon's main square on Thursday afternoon as a group of masked men were seen forcing two women into a white van. The scene sparked panic among onlookers, who quickly called the police on the emergency hotline. Responding to the calls, several police vehicles rushed to the scene and chased down the white van. After a brief chase, the van was forced to stop, and the masked men were apprehended. However, what the police found inside the van was not what they expected. The two women, who were allegedly abducted, turned out to be thrill-seekers who had paid to be kidnapped. The pair was arrested along with four Portuguese nationals who were involved in the staged abduction. According to the police, the group had planned the fake kidnapping as a form of entertainment. The group's bizarre actions have been widely criticized, and many have expressed their outrage over the incident. Lisbon's mayor, Fernando Medina, said in a statement that "this kind of behavior is unacceptable in our city, and we will not tolerate it." The four Portuguese nationals who were involved in the incident have been charged with false imprisonment, and the two women have been charged with falsely reporting a crime. The incident has led to a debate about the legality of such "kidnapping games," which have become increasingly popular in recent years. Many have argued that such games, which involve simulated abductions, are dangerous and have the potential to cause harm. In 2016, a similar incident occurred in Spain when a group of British tourists were arrested for staging a fake kidnapping as part of a stag party. The incident caused outrage among the local community and led to calls for tighter regulations on such activities. Despite the controversy, the trend of simulated abductions continues to grow, and many companies now offer such experiences as a form of entertainment. However, critics argue that such activities trivialize a serious crime and can cause trauma to those who have actually been abducted. The incident in Lisbon has once again highlighted the need for stricter regulations on such activities. While many may see such stunts as harmless fun, the potential consequences are far-reaching and can have serious implications. As the aftermath of the incident continues to unfold, it remains to be seen what the lasting impact of this bizarre and unsettling event will be. For now, the city of Lisbon is left to grapple with the fallout of a staged kidnapping gone wrong.
