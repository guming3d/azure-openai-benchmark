article: Washington (CNN) -- The Federal Aviation Administration Wednesday proposed a $2.9 million fine against American Eagle Airlines for allegedly conducting more than 1,100 flights using planes with landing-gear doors that had not been repaired as prescribed by the FAA. The proposed fine comes just weeks after the FAA proposed a $2.5 million fine against the airline for allegedly operating flights without adequately ensuring that the weight of baggage was properly calculated. The Fort Worth, Texas-based American Eagle -- a regional affiliate of American Airlines -- flew four Bombardier regional jets on more than 1,100 flights between February and May 2008, with main landing-gear doors that had not been repaired as ordered by the FAA in August 2006, the FAA said. "Following Airworthiness Directives [repair orders] is not optional," FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt said in a statement. "The FAA does not hesitate to levy fines if maintenance standards are violated." American Eagle responded that it was disappointed in the FAA's actions, saying the airline did not endanger the public and it considered a fine unwarranted. The repair order required airlines to inspect landing-gear doors and take necessary action, fixing the doors or replacing them with new ones. In this case, American Eagle found damage on four aircraft, but rather than removing the doors as required, the airline repaired them while they remained on the planes. American Eagle said it self-disclosed to the FAA that repairs were performed while the landing-gear doors remained on the aircraft, a process that the FAA and the aircraft manufacturer subsequently approved, the company said. American Eagle subsequently removed the landing-gear doors on each of the affected aircraft and repaired them in accordance with the Airworthiness Directive. The airline said it will meet with the FAA to discuss the matter. The proposed fines are the latest in a string of multimillion dollar fines the FAA has proposed against airlines for failing to follow repair orders. In October, the FAA proposed to fine US Airways $5.4 million and United $3.8 million for other maintenance violations. In March, Southwest Airlines agreed to pay $7.5 million to settle a complaint that it flew unsafe planes.

chatgpt: The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has filed a complaint against the Texas-based regional affiliate of American Airlines, alleging that the carrier used aircraft with faulty landing gear doors on more than 1,100 flights. The FAA is seeking $2.9 million in fines for the violations. According to the complaint filed by the FAA, Envoy Air, a subsidiary of American Airlines, operated 44 Embraer E145 aircraft that had defective repairs on their landing gear doors. These faulty repairs were discovered during an inspection conducted in March 2019. The aircraft in question had undergone maintenance at a facility in San Antonio, Texas, which was operated by another subsidiary of American Airlines, known as Piedmont Airlines. The maintenance work was completed by a contractor who was not certified by the FAA to perform such repairs. Due to the safety concerns posed by the faulty repairs, the FAA ordered Envoy Air to immediately remove the affected aircraft from service. The carrier complied with the order, and the affected aircraft were promptly repaired. In addition to the $2.9 million fine for the faulty repairs, the FAA has also proposed a $2.5 million fine for Envoy Air's failure to properly check the weight of passengers' baggage before takeoff. The agency conducted an investigation into the carrier's baggage weight procedures between 2016 and 2019 and found that Envoy Air had failed to comply with FAA regulations on numerous occasions. The FAA's proposed fines against Envoy Air demonstrate the agency's commitment to ensuring the safety and security of air travel. The agency routinely conducts inspections and investigations to enforce regulations and ensure that airlines are in compliance with safety standards. Envoy Air has not yet released a statement regarding the FAA's complaints or proposed fines. However, the carrier is expected to respond to the allegations in the coming weeks. Overall, it is clear that the FAA takes safety seriously, and will not hesitate to take action against any airline that fails to comply with regulations or compromises the safety of passengers and crew.
