The coroner heard Anita Hughes was drinking vodka at a Christmas Eve party but was found collapsed on the floor . A mother-of-three was killed by her Christmas Eve tipple with friends in a sudden and rare reaction to drinking vodka. Anita Hughes, 44, died from a 'largely unrecognised phenomenon' when her heart stopped after the festive drink. An inquest heard she suffered Sudden Unexpected Death in Alcohol Misuse (SUDAM) - a condition which leads to 1,000 deaths in the UK every year. The coroner heard divorced Miss Hughes was drinking vodka at a Christmas Eve party with her partner and friends at home. When her children woke up on Christmas morning, they found their mother collapsed on the floor. She was taken to hospital in Wrexham, North Wales, where she was pronounced dead. Acting coroner for North East Wales John Gittins recorded a verdict of accidental death. He said: 'Sudden Unexpected Death in Alcohol Misuse is a largely unrecognised phenomenon. This is a very sad loss of life. 'If the brain gets deranged and electrical signals go amiss then you can have a situation called cardiac arrhythmia. 'The signals that tell the heart to beat go awry and the heart simply stops. 'Alcohol can cause that if used excessively. 'I hope the circumstances of this death, traumatic as they are, do not take away from your memories of Miss Hughes.' Miss Hughes was found collapsed on Christmas morning by her children and taken to Wrexham Maelor Hospital where she was pronounced dead . Divorced Miss Hughes, from Brymbo, Wrexham, was mother to Karly, 22, and sons Ricky, 20, and Scott, 13. The inquest heard the cafe catering assistant normally drank twice a week but had shared vodka on Christmas Eve. Toxicology tests showed Miss Hughes was more than four times over the legal drink-driving limit. Pathologist Dr Anthony Howell Burdge confirmed the most likely cause of death was SUDAM. Paying tribute to her sister, Miss Jones said: 'She was very fun-loving, and she loved her children. 'She had always worked. She liked the good things in life.'
