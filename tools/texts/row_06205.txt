article: A British banker is facing murder charges in Hong Kong over the killing of two women in an upscale apartment in the city's central district of Wan Chai -- where one of the victims was discovered stuffed inside a suitcase on the apartment balcony. The suspect, a 29-year-old man identified as Rurik Jutting, appeared before a magistrates' court in Hong Kong on Monday facing two charges of murder. Wearing black-rimmed glasses, a black t-shirt, and dark jeans, he was not handcuffed and responded "I do" when asked by the court clerk if he understood the charges against him. He didn't enter a plea. Authorities said they were called to the highrise apartment in the popular nightlife district of Wan Chai early Saturday morning by the suspect. They first discovered a woman lying inside the residence, identified by local media as a disc jockey at a neighborhood pub who is 25 to 30 years old. She had visible cuts on her body and was pronounced dead at the scene, according to a police statement. Officers then discovered the body of another woman, with wounds on her neck, stuffed inside a suitcase on the apartment's balcony. The second victim was identified as Sumarti Ningsih, according to court documents, which said she had been killed on October 27. Sumarti was a 25-year-old Indonesian woman who entered Hong Kong last month on a tourist visa, according to a report in the South China Morning Post. The other woman wasn't identified. Court documents said she'd been killed on Saturday. When they arrived at the apartment, police discovered a gruesome scene with the residence covered in blood, the newspaper reported. One of the victims was found with "her throat slashed." Police said they arrested the suspect after finding a knife at the scene. Court documents gave his occupation as a "banker" for Bank of America in Hong Kong. Paul Scanlon, a spokesman for Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong, said that a person named Rurik Jutting had worked there but left the bank recently. He declined to comment further on the case. The British Foreign Office confirmed that a British citizen was arrested in Hong Kong on suspicion of murder, but did not release the name, citing regulations. Autopsies will be performed on the victims to determine the cause of death, authorities said. Jutting didn't apply for bail on Monday. He will remain in jail until his next court appearance on November 10. Such cases are unusual in Hong Kong, which has a low rate of violent crime for a city its size. The upscale apartment building where the bodies were found is described by real estate sites as popular with expatriates for its luxurious facilities, including a heated rooftop swimming pool. The Wan Chai district, in a central area of Hong Kong Island, is known for its high number of restaurants, bars and nightclubs, as well as strip clubs.

chatgpt: In a chilling case that has sent shockwaves across Hong Kong, British banker Rurik Jutting appeared before a Hong Kong court on Monday to face two murder charges. The 29-year-old is accused of the gruesome killing of two women in his luxury high-rise apartment in the city's Wan Chai district. Described as a "violent and bloody scene" by police, the victims were identified as 23-year-old Sumarti Ningsih and 26-year-old Seneng Mujiasih. The body of Ningsih was found stuffed in a suitcase on the balcony of Jutting's apartment while the body of Mujiasih was found in the apartment itself. Ningsih, who was from Indonesia, had reportedly come to Hong Kong to work as a domestic helper, while Mujiasih, also Indonesian, had been working as a waitress in a nearby bar. It is believed that both women had been in contact with Jutting prior to their deaths. Jutting, who had worked for Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong, was arrested on suspicion of murder on Saturday. He appeared in court wearing a black T-shirt and jeans, with a closely-shaved head. During the brief hearing, Jutting spoke only to confirm his name and that he understood the charges against him. He did not enter a plea and was remanded in custody. The case has sent shockwaves through Hong Kong, a city that prides itself on its safety and low crime rate. The killings occurred in a luxury high-rise apartment in one of the city's most sought-after areas. Police have not released details of the motive for the killings or the circumstances leading up to them. However, reports suggest that Jutting had been under extreme stress at work and had been taking drugs in the weeks leading up to the killings. The case has also raised concerns about the treatment of domestic helpers in Hong Kong. There are currently around 300,000 domestic helpers in the city, mostly from Indonesia and the Philippines, who are often subject to poor working conditions and abuse. Local activists have called for an investigation into the treatment of domestic helpers in Hong Kong, with some citing the case as evidence of the need for better protection for these workers. The case is set to continue in the coming weeks, with Jutting due to appear in court again on November 10. If found guilty, he faces a possible life sentence in prison. Meanwhile, the families of the victims are mourning their loss, with Ningsih's father calling for justice to be done. "My daughter went to Hong Kong to work hard and earn money," he said. "She did not deserve to die like this."
