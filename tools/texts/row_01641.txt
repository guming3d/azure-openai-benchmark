Shoppers are being hoodwinked by organic beauty products laced with chemicals found in antifreeze, floor cleaners and engine oil, campaigners warned last night. It said Boots, Nivea and other manufacturers misled the public. The Soil Association surveyed shampoos, creams and other toiletries labelled as being organic, natural or inspired by nature. Nivea was criticised for using an unofficial logo to proclaim its Pure And Natural hand cream as ’95 per cent natural’. However, the ingredients show it . contains methylisothiazolinone, a preservative found in window and floor . cleaners and air fresheners. The association said the chemical could cause cancer and is suspected of causing nerve damage. Boots Botanics – a skin care range which draws on the ‘power of plants’ – was also put under the microscope. Items . singled out included the facial oil, costing £9.99, which is labelled . as 100 per cent organic but was found to contain at least four . non-organic ingredients. US . firm Organix – a beauty company unconnected to the British baby food . manufacturer of the same name – was accused of ‘misleading marketing’. Although the brand name suggests products will be organic, its coconut shampoo does not contain any organic ingredients, and there were concerns that at least one component may cause cancer. Unlike organic food, the labelling of organic beauty products is not covered by law. However, there are voluntary certification schemes run by organisations, including the Soil Association. To qualify, certain chemicals are banned from products and all plant-based ingredients must have been grown organically. Peter Melchett, the Soil Association’s policy director, said the many companies that strive to meet the standards are being undermined by those that take shortcuts and make misleading claims. He added: ‘It is wrong that people are putting chemicals found in antifreeze, paint, oven cleaner and floor cleaner on their skin, when they thought they were buying a product made from only natural or organic ingredients. This must stop.’ The Soil Association surveyed shampoos, creams and other toiletries labelled as being organic, natural or inspired by nature . Nivea and Organix did not comment on the claims. Boots said any problems with its Botanics range were related to labelling and not the products themselves. A spokesman added: ‘The Botanics range uses the power of plants extracts with scientific formulations to create effective skin care products. We would like to reassure our customers that the ingredients in the Botanics Organic Facial Oil support a 100 per cent organic claim and Trading Standards approve our process. ‘The ingredient list on the packaging may not make this clear. We will look to rectify this immediately.’

chatgpt: A new survey by the Soil Association has found that many shampoos and creams labelled as organic actually contain harmful chemicals. The survey tested a range of popular skin care products and found that both Boots Botanics and Nivea skin care ranges were criticised in the findings. One of the products tested, a 'Pure and Natural' hand cream, contained the preservative methylisothiazolinone. This chemical is also commonly found in window cleaner and can cause cancer. The Soil Association is calling on companies to provide more transparency when it comes to labelling and ingredients. Many consumers believe that 'organic' products are a healthier and safer alternative to traditional skin care and beauty products. However, the Soil Association's survey has shown that this is not always the case. The use of synthetic chemicals in personal care products is a growing concern among consumers. The Soil Association has said that there needs to be greater regulation of the beauty and personal care industry to ensure that products are safe for consumers. The survey also found that there were many products on the market that claimed to be organic, but in fact contained synthetic chemicals. The use of methylisothiazolinone in skin care products is a particular concern, as it has been linked to cancer and other health problems. The chemical is also known to cause skin irritation and allergic reactions. The Soil Association is urging consumers to be more aware of the products they are using and to read the labels carefully. The survey found that many popular products contained a range of synthetic chemicals, including parabens, phthalates and petroleum-based ingredients. These chemicals have been linked to a range of health problems, including hormonal disruption, cancer and environmental damage. The Soil Association is calling on companies to be more transparent about the ingredients they use in their products. They are also urging consumers to do their own research and to choose products that are truly organic and free from harmful chemicals. In conclusion, the Soil Association's survey has highlighted the need for greater regulation and transparency in the personal care industry. The use of harmful chemicals in skin care and beauty products is a growing concern, and consumers need to be more aware of the products they are using. Companies must do more to ensure that their products are safe and free from harmful chemicals.
