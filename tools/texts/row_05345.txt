article: (CNN) -- Some might say that Scott Schreck ruined his family's vacation, but he also redeemed himself. The father's wrong turn got his family lost in the Florida Everglades, but his outdoor skills helped steer rescuers to their location. The Schreck family -- Scott, Carrie and their three young boys -- spent a night in the swampy wilderness Thursday in an ecosystem home to alligators, snakes and mosquitoes. The five passengers had set out that day for a tour in the Everglades in a borrowed airboat, but a wrong turn placed them in an unplanned adventure. The airboat became stuck in vegetation and couldn't be turned around. "This is the first time I've been out here, so obviously I'm a novice on this body of water. Not the thing to do," Schreck told CNN affiliate WPLG. Earlier, the Seville, Ohio, family had enjoyed a fun time fishing for bass and taking photos of alligators. Once they got stuck, leisure time turned to survival time. The avid outdoorsman hacked down some cypress trees to make a lean-to. "We had a whole bunch of life jackets. (We) put it on top to keep the rain off," Schreck said. It was a rainy and cold night, and the family -- who were wearing only T-shirts and shorts -- huddled close for warmth. "It was kinda cold and wet, we didn't really go to sleep at all, and there were lots of mosquitoes," 9-year-old Luke Schreck told WPLG. "I was kind of scared. I didn't know when we were going to get out." His brothers are 7 and 3 years old. When the Schrecks did not return from their trip on Thursday, concerned family members called the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Numerous local agencies aided in the search with airboats and aerial observation. The dense vegetation and camouflage airboat that the Schrecks used made the rescue difficult, officials said. "It's like looking for a needle in a haystack," Miami-Dade Fire Rescue spokesman Lt. Arnold Piedrahita Jr. told WPLG. In addition to building the shelter, the Schrecks fired a flare into the night, and in the morning used air horns and whistles to make noise that ultimately led to their rescue. "We weren't able to see them, we were only able to hear them," Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission spokesman Jorge Pino told the affiliate. The family was examined and released from a local hospital. The next order of business, Luke Schreck said, was to get some sleep. CNN's Chuck Johnston contributed to this report.

chatgpt: The Schreck family had an experience they will never forget during their airboat tour of the Everglades. They thought it would be fun to explore the lush wetlands of the area on a sunny day, but things quickly went south. At some point during the tour, the family became lost, and they could not find their way back to the starting point. They tried retracing their steps, but no matter how hard they tried, they could not reach familiar territory. As night settled in, the family realized they would have to spend the night in the woods. The Schrecks did not come unprepared. They had packed some food and water, and they made a makeshift shelter with branches and sticks. But spending the night in the forest was still a terrifying experience for the family, especially the children. They tried to stay calm and hopeful, but every little sound made them jump. In the morning, the family decided to use the airhorns they had brought along to signal for rescue. They knew that airhorns were loud and could travel far in the quietness of the woods. They blew the airhorns, hoping that someone would hear them and come to their rescue. Luckily for the Schrecks, their strategy worked. A group of rescuers was exploring the area, looking for any signs of lost tourists. When they heard the loud noise coming from the woods, they immediately headed towards the source. The Schrecks heard the approaching footsteps and felt a sudden surge of hope. The rescue team found the Schrecks and quickly assessed their situation. The family was disoriented but unharmed, and they were overjoyed to see their rescuers. The team helped them pack their belongings and led them back to their airboat. The Schrecks were grateful for the rescuers' help and relieved to be back in civilization. They never expected their airboat tour to turn into a nightmarish experience, but they learned a valuable lesson about the importance of preparation and caution when exploring unfamiliar terrain. Airboat tours of the Everglades are popular tourist activities, but visitors must always be aware of the risks and dangers of the area. Getting lost in the woods can quickly turn into a life-threatening situation, especially during the hot and humid months of the year. Visitors are advised to pack plenty of food and water, wear appropriate clothing and footwear, and carry a reliable means of communication or signaling device. The Schreck family's ordeal ended well, but it could have been much worse. Their quick thinking and the rescuers' prompt response saved them from a potentially perilous situation. The family will never forget their adventure in the Everglades, but they might think twice before venturing into unknown territory again.
