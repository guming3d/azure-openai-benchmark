article: From coffee to cigarettes, many of us have addictions. But one woman is so addicted to cat food that she gorges on a staggering 900 kitty treats every single day. Mary, 46, from Farwell, Michigan, began binging on the treats following a difficult divorce. Scroll down for video . Mary is so addicted to cat food that she eats 900 kitty treats every single day . After the breakdown of her marriage, Mary (she does not reveal her surname in the programme) spent much of her time sitting around at home with her three cats and was tempted into trying a treat. What started as an innocent urge to sample the cat food led to an addiction after Mary was left instantly hooked. Her addiction began after she suffered a difficult divorce and spent much of her time alone with just her three cats . Mary spends a staggering amount of money of treats for herself every month and says they make her mouth water . 'They just burst with flavour in your mouth and I love them' she said during an interview on My Strange Addiction, which premieres on Discovery Real Time tonight. 'When I start thinking about a certain flavour of cat treat, my mouth will water,' she said. In the programme, Mary showcases a variety of her favourite flavours from treats with a cheesy centre to beefy flavoured biscuits that she awards '10 out of 10 for crunch factor'. Speaking on the show, Mary's brother Tommy said: 'It's gross. There are four basic food groups and cat food is not one of them.' Mary's brother Tommy says it is not healthy to eat the cat treats but Mary is addicted . Unemployed Mary spends $200 (£125) on cat food for herself every month, which she admits is more than she spends on human food. She is sure to always keep a stash of the goodies in her car, purse and by her bedside table for late-night munchies, and she says she will even gorge on cat food at the expense of what she calls 'people food.' 'There have been days when I eat treats all day long and no people food,' she says. 'The cabinet just calls my name: "Mary come eat" and I will go sit on the deck and snack.' ‘My Strange Addiction’ premieres on Discovery Real Time on Tuesdays at 9.00pm and 9.30pm .

chatgpt: Mary from Michigan made headlines after confessing to her addiction to cat biscuits. The 34-year-old woman's strange cravings started when she accidentally grabbed a handful of cat biscuits instead of her regular cereal one morning. She didn't expect to enjoy the taste but to her surprise, she loved it. Since then, she has been gorging on cat biscuits every day, unable to resist the urge. Mary said that she was hesitant at first, but the taste was surprisingly delicious. "It's hard to describe, but there's a subtle sweetness to it that I adore," she said. "It's not something I ever thought I would like, but now I can't get enough of it." Despite the obvious health risks, Mary continues to indulge in her feline treat. Her friends and family have become increasingly concerned and have urged her to seek help. "I know it's not healthy, but I can't help it," she admits. Experts warn that consuming cat food can lead to serious health problems, such as liver problems, kidney failure, and even death. Humans and cats have different nutritional requirements, and what might be suitable for one species may be harmful to another. Mary's case is not unique. In fact, there are numerous cases of people who have developed an addiction to pet food. Some even go as far as eating raw meat or drinking canned dog food. It's important for people to understand that pet food is formulated to meet the nutritional needs of animals, not humans. Just because it might taste good, it doesn't mean it's safe to consume. Mary is aware of the risks involved, but she still can't shake off her addiction to cat biscuits. She hopes that by sharing her story, others who are struggling with unusual food cravings will seek help. "I know I need to stop, but it's easier said than done," she said. "I hope my story will inspire others to seek help if they're going through something similar." Mary's case serves as a reminder that addiction can come in many forms and that seeking help is always the best solution.
