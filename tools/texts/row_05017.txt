Strivers in work will be hit less hard than the workless by plans to cap state benefits, figures suggest. Labour will today vote against plans to cap increases in welfare handouts at one per cent for the next three years, saying six out of ten people hit by the changes will be in work. But the Institute for Fiscal Studies yesterday released figures showing that workers will lose less than those who live entirely on benefits. Labour will today vote against plans to cap increases in welfare handouts at one per cent for the next three years. But some Labour MPs believe Ed Miliband (right) and Ed Balls (left) are wrong to oppose the cap . The IFS said 7million workers would lose an average of £165 a year, while  2.8million without a job will lose £215 a year in 2015-16 – a £50 bigger hit to those who don’t work. Ministers say a working couple will also see their income tax cut by £1,200 as a result of changes to the personal  allowance, which come in from April, far outweighing the losses to tax credits. Former home secretary Jacqui Smith said it will let the Tories 'paint us as a party which cares more about those unwilling to work than those struggling in work' But the IFS also revealed that the proportion of those hit by the changes would fall far more heavily on the workless. While nine in ten workless households will see their entitlements reduced, 3million of the 7million working families hit will be affected only by a cap in rises to child benefit and only 4million will lose out as a result of other changes. If just working tax credits are counted, three out of ten people in work will lose out. Today’s vote has been called by the Government to try to lay out a key dividing line ahead of the next election. Some Labour MPs believe Ed Miliband and Ed Balls have put Labour on the wrong side of public opinion by opposing the cap, which polls suggest is popular with voters. Former home secretary Jacqui Smith said it will let the Tories ‘paint us as a party which cares more about those unwilling to work than those struggling in work’. The Tory Party has released figures showing that Labour has opposed welfare savings that amount to £83billion by 2015/16 and would have to raise borrowing or debt by the equivalent of £5,000 per family. The Tories are unveiling a campaign poster that says: ‘Today Labour are voting to increase benefits by more than workers’ wages. Conservatives: Standing Up for Working People.’

chatgpt: The Labour party is set to vote against the UK government's plans to limit increases in welfare handouts to one percent for the next three years. The party argues that six out of ten individuals impacted by these changes will be working, and the newly released figures show that those who live entirely on benefits will be hit harder than workers. The controversial proposal was unveiled in 2013, with the goal of saving the government approximately £2.5 billion annually. The cap means that most working-age benefits, including jobseeker's allowance, employment and support allowance, and income support, will only increase by one percent in each of the next three years. Opponents, including Labour, have argued that the policy unfairly targets those individuals most in need of government assistance. They've further criticized the government for failing to consider the wider impacts of the policy, such as rising poverty and inequality. Labour has also pointed out that many of the individuals affected by the policy will be working, with six out of ten set to feel the pinch. They argue that these workers, who make up a significant portion of low and middle-income households, are already experiencing significant financial hardship. New figures, however, suggest that these workers may not be hit as hard as those who rely entirely on benefits. Analysis conducted by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) indicates that the policy will only have "marginal" impacts on disposable incomes for those in work. In contrast, individuals who rely on benefits to survive will see their incomes fall by an average of 4% by 2020. The IFS report indicates that the impacts of the policy will vary based on household size and income. Larger families will be hit harder than smaller ones, as the cap affects the income for the first two children in a family. Those earning less than £10,000 per year will also see significant reductions in disposable income. Despite the potential for impacts on low-income workers, Labour remains committed to voting against the policy. The party argues that it is fundamentally unfair and risks pushing already struggling families deeper into poverty. The vote comes after months of intense scrutiny over the government's record on poverty reduction. Earlier this year, a UN report found that poverty in the UK was "systematic" and "tragic." The report further criticized the government for failing to address poverty in a meaningful way. The debate over welfare cuts is likely to shape the upcoming general election, with Labour calling for a significant rollback of austerity policies. The party has pledged to invest heavily in public services, including healthcare and education, and to support the most vulnerable members of society. As the vote approaches, the UK's most vulnerable individuals are bracing themselves for the impact of the cap. Many fear that it will contribute to further poverty and inequality, while others remain optimistic that the government will listen to the concerns of Labour and other critics of the policy.
