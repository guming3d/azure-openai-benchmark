article: (CNN)Just how cold and miserable is it in upstate New York? It's apparently so miserable that even those whose job it is to encourage visits to Ithaca are telling tourists they probably should make other plans. Web visitors who go to VisitIthaca.com, the Ithaca/Tompkins County Convention and Visitors Bureau website, will now see a pop-up banner that says, "That's it. We surrender. Winter, you win. Key West anyone?" Bruce Stoff, director of the Visitors Bureau, came up with the unconventional marketing campaign. "It was 5 degrees below zero this morning when I woke up," Stoff said Monday. "Everyone in the Northeast is beaten by winter now, and we're dreaming of being someplace that is warm." The message goes on to say, "Due to this ridiculously stupid winter, Ithaca invites you to visit the Florida Keys this week. Please come back when things thaw out. Really, it's for the birds here now." It provides a link to the Keys website at fla-keys.com. A spokesperson for the Florida Keys Tourism Council called the initiative "the wackiest thing I've ever seen in my life from a tourism marketing standpoint." Andy Newman got a call from Stoff last week pitching the idea and asking for permission to use pictures of the Florida Keys homepage. This wasn't an advertising campaign, Newman said, and no money was exchanged. "I didn't believe he'd actually go through with it," Newman said. But considering the weather conditions in the Keys right now, he understands. "It's in the 70s, there's no snow and no frost on the ground," Newman said. "Come on down. Why wouldn't you?" Winter spreads its reach from Northeast to South and beyond . CNN's John Branch contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Tourists looking to visit Ithaca, New York this winter may be in for a surprise when they visit VisitIthaca.com, as the site is redirecting visitors to a Florida Keys tourism site. The message on the site reads, "Please come back when things thaw out. Really, it's for the birds here now." The redirect is a humorous response to the harsh winter weather that Ithaca is currently experiencing. The brutal cold and heavy snowfall have made travel in the area difficult, leading many tourists to reconsider their plans. VisitIthaca.com is operated by the Ithaca/Tompkins County Convention and Visitors Bureau, which promotes tourism in the area. While the redirect may seem counterproductive, it's actually a smart move on the Bureau's part. By redirecting tourists to the warmer climate of the Florida Keys, they're keeping their brand in the mind of potential visitors while acknowledging the current weather conditions. This is not the first time the Bureau has used humor to promote tourism in Ithaca. Last year, they launched a campaign called "Ithaca is Gorges," which featured punny slogans and scenic photos of the area's gorges. The campaign was a hit, garnering national attention and boosting tourism to the area. Despite the harsh winter weather, Ithaca remains a popular destination year-round. Home to Cornell University and Ithaca College, the area boasts a vibrant arts and culture scene, as well as numerous outdoor activities such as hiking, skiing, and ice-skating. While the redirect to the Florida Keys may be temporary, VisitIthaca.com remains a valuable resource for anyone looking to plan a trip to the area. Visitors can browse information on local attractions, restaurants, and lodging, and even download a free travel guide. Whether you're looking to escape the cold or embrace it, Ithaca has something for everyone.
