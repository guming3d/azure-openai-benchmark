Soaring through the air, she aims for park ranger Victoria Sissons’s  arm, and, on making a safe landing, scampers along her sleeve to pilfer her pockets. Scroll down for video .

Red squirrels can jump up to 20ft through tree canopies when they spot food, which helps explain why  Hazel appears to be sailing through the air. As for the pickpocketing, it’s a trick she has learned because rangers at Escot park, in East Devon, carry nuts with them especially for the eight red squirrels who live in an enclosure there. The squirrels have even started pickpocketing visitors – although it’s unclear how many snacks they’ve managed to get their paws on. Rangers have excused Hazel’s behaviour because they believe she is pregnant and gathering food ahead of giving birth. Red squirrels are extinct in Devon but John-Michael Kennaway, whose family has owned the estate for 200 years, has helped to establish a small conservation area for them on his land and hopes to one day release them into the wild near Land’s End.

chatgpt: In recent weeks, visitors to a popular country park have found themselves unexpectedly light-handed after encounters with some of the cheekiest creatures in the area – red squirrels. These wily animals have taken to lightening the pockets of unsuspecting visitors in search of their next meal. However, when it comes to one particular red squirrel by the name of Hazel, park rangers have been quick to excuse her behaviour, suspecting that she may be pregnant. Hazel's reputation as a master pickpocket started to spread through the park earlier this summer. Reports began to emerge of visitors losing their wallets, phones and even sandwiches, only to find that a nearby red squirrel had made off with the items. While some visitors found the behaviour amusing, others were understandably frustrated by the loss of their belongings. But while Hazel may be labelled as cheeky, she has endeared herself to many in the park because of her unique method of food gathering. Rather than simply foraging on the ground, Hazel likes to take to the trees to collect her beloved hazelnuts. Red squirrels are known for their impressive jumping abilities, and Hazel is no exception – rangers have seen her leap up to 20ft through the tree canopies in pursuit of her favourite snacks. While it may be tempting to label Hazel's behaviour as arrogant or even criminal, park rangers have urged visitors to think more objectively. They have emphasized that red squirrels, like most animals, are instinct-driven creatures that are simply doing what they need to do to survive. For Hazel, this means going to great lengths to find the food that she needs to support herself and, potentially, her growing family. Indeed, it is this potential pregnancy that has led park rangers to be more forgiving of Hazel's behaviour. Red squirrels typically have litters of between two and six babies, and Hazel's observed behaviours suggest that she may be expecting shortly. As any parent knows, when you're carrying a child, you have to prioritize their needs – and for Hazel, that means finding enough food to support herself and her unborn offspring. Despite the increasing number of pickpocketing incidents, it seems that most visitors to the park remain fond of the red squirrels. With their playful antics and impressive agility, these creatures have long been a favourite among visitors of all ages. Even Hazel, with her penchant for thievery, has won the hearts of many. However, park rangers are urging visitors to take precautions when entering the park. They have suggested that visitors keep a close eye on their belongings and ensure that they are well-secured. Additionally, they have warned that visitors should not attempt to feed the squirrels directly, as this can cause them to lose their natural instincts and become more aggressive. As for Hazel and her growing family, park rangers have promised to keep a close eye on her behaviours and ensure that she is well-cared for. They have also suggested that visitors avoid disrupting her natural hunting behaviours, allowing her to continue to gather the nuts and seeds that she needs to sustain a healthy, happy life. Despite the ongoing challenges posed by pickpocketing squirrels, it seems that most visitors to the park remain fond of these playful creatures. For Hazel and her fellow red squirrels, the park continues to provide an ideal playground full of trees to climb, nuts to gather and visitors to cheekily pickpocket.
