Growth: Men are, on average, four inches taller than they were around the time of the start of the First World War . Men are four inches taller than they were 100 years ago, according to a new study. Researchers found the average height of European men has grown by 11 centimetres in just over a century. And, contrary to expectations, the study also found that average height actually accelerated in the period spanning the two World Wars and the Great Depression. Timothy Hatton, Professor of Economics at the University of Essex, examined and analysed figures for the average height - at the age of around 21 - of men from the 1870’s to 1980 in 15 European countries. The statistics were drawn from a variety of sources. For the most recent decades the data was mainly taken from height-by-age in surveys. Figures for the earlier years were based on data for the heights of military conscripts and recruits. The figures are for men only as the historical evidence for women’s heights is severely limited. Professor Hatton said: 'Increases in human stature are a key indicator of improvements in the average health of populations. 'The evidence suggests that the improving disease environment, as reflected in the fall in infant mortality, is the single most important factor driving the increase in height. 'The link between infant mortality and height has already been demonstrated by a number of studies.' Infant mortality rates fell from an average of 178 per 1,000 in the period from 1871 to 1875 to 120 per 1,000 in 1911 to 1915. They then plummeted to 41 in 1951 to 1955 and just 14 from 1976 to 1980. Prof Hatton said that in northern and . middle European countries - including Britain and Ireland, the . Scandinavian countries, Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, and Germany - . there was a 'distinct quickening' in the pace of advance in the period . spanning the two World Wars and the Great Depression. Smaller family sizes, better nutrition and improved livjng conditions are behind the spike in height. File picture . He added: 'This is striking because the period largely pre-dates the wide implementation of major breakthroughs in modern medicine and national health services. 'One possible reason, alongside the crucial decline in infant mortality, for the rapid growth of average male height in this period was that there was a strong downward trend in fertility at the time, and smaller family sizes have already been linked with increasing height.' He said other factors in the increase in average male height include an increased income per capita; more sanitary housing and living conditions; better general education about health and nutrition which led to better care for children and young people within the home; and better social services and health systems. The findings were published in the journal Oxford Economic Papers.

chatgpt: Reports indicate that European men have grown taller in recent years, with significant improvements in their diets and housing conditions being credited for the trend. Research suggests that better nutrition, access to healthcare, and improvements in sanitation have led to an increase in height in many European countries. According to a study published in the journal eLife, men in the Netherlands have seen the most significant increase in height, growing an average of 8cm since the mid-19th century. Other countries like Belgium, France, Germany, and Scandinavian countries have also seen a noticeable increase in height in their populations. Interestingly, the study found that health breakthroughs, such as medical advancements and disease prevention efforts, did not appear to play a significant role in the trend. Instead, researchers believe that improvements in nutrition and living conditions are the primary factors contributing to the height increase. As access to food and healthcare improved over the years, people were able to receive the necessary nutrients and care to support growth and development. Furthermore, improved sanitation conditions meant that people were less likely to be plagued by illnesses that could hinder growth. While some critics may argue that the trend towards growing taller is superficial, height can actually have a significant impact on an individual's overall health and well-being. Taller individuals are often perceived to be more successful and experience better job opportunities and higher incomes. Taller people also tend to have better cardiovascular health and a reduced risk of heart disease, diabetes, and other chronic illnesses. Additionally, studies have shown that taller people tend to live longer than their shorter counterparts. All of these factors suggest that the trend towards growing taller could have significant implications for European societies in the years to come. Despite the benefits associated with growing taller, there are some concerns that the trend could also have negative consequences. For example, taller individuals may require more resources and produce a larger ecological footprint due to their increased energy requirements. Furthermore, the trend could exacerbate existing societal inequalities, with shorter individuals being marginalized and facing discrimination. As such, it is important for European societies to continue to focus on improving nutrition and living conditions while also being mindful of the potential consequences of growing taller. Researchers suggest that increased access to healthy food, healthcare, and sanitation should remain a top priority as societies strive towards improving the well-being of all their citizens. In conclusion, the trend towards growing taller among European men is a testament to the positive impact that nutrition and living conditions can have on human growth and development. While the trend may have some potential negative consequences, such as increased resource consumption and societal inequality, it is ultimately a positive reflection of the progress that European societies have made over the years in improving the health and well-being of their populations.
