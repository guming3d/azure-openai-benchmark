After a big night out, man people will wake up with no recollection of the stupid things they have done. But one drunk could not escape the prank he pulled, after he woke up to find his crime hopping around his room. Merlin Quinnan stole a rabbit and a guinea pig after a boozy night out - only to realise what had happened when he woke up to find them scampering around his bedroom, a court heard. Merlin Quinnan, 21, (pictured) broke into a woman's garden and took the animals from their hutches . Hapless Quinnan, 21, broke into a woman’s garden and took the startled animals from their hutches. The next day, when he realised what had happened, he put pictures of them on Facebook and tried to sell the animals for £10. Quinnan, of Redruth, Cornwall, admitted the theft as well as stealing a mountain bike and four offences of criminal damage to cars and a motorcycle. Quinnan found the animals (not pictured) hopping round his room . He was sentenced to a 12-month community order with an alcoholic treatment scheme requirement for six months at Truro Magistrates Court. He was also ordered to pay £210 compensation - including £10 to the owner of the rabbit. The bizarre theft echoes a similar incident in February. Anthony Campen, 29, kidnapped a chicken from a nearby primary school before dragging it to a houseparty where he posed with it before releasing it into the wild. Police used the pictures to force Campen to admit his crime after he posted a number of photos on Facebook. Pupils at the Bishops' Church of England and Roman Catholic Primary School in Chelmsford, Essex, had believed their pet chicken, called Olympia, had escapedbefore they began to suspect foul play. Campen, from Chelmsford, Essex, admitted causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal sometime between January 26 and 28 this year 2012 when he appeared at Chelmsford Magistrates Court on February 20.

chatgpt: Merlin Quinnan, a man from Lincolnshire, was recently sentenced to a 12-month community order with an alcohol treatment scheme requirement for six months after being found guilty of breaking into a garden and taking animals from their hutches. He then attempted to sell them for £10 each. Quinnan's actions were discovered after he posted pictures of the animals on his Facebook page, advertising them for sale. His post caught the attention of animal lovers across the region who were horrified at the idea of someone trying to profit from stolen animals. Fortunately, the perpetrator was quickly identified and arrested by local law enforcement . During questioning, Quinnan admitted to breaking into the garden and taking the animals, but claimed that he had done so because he wanted to give them a better life. In court, the judge wasn't swayed by his defense and instead emphasized the severity of his crime. In addition to the community order and alcohol treatment scheme requirement, Quinnan was ordered to pay £210 in compensation to the animals' rightful owner. The judge spoke out against Quinnan's actions, noting that the theft and attempted sale of the animals was not only illegal, but also deeply unethical. "These animals were taken from their rightful owner and were being sold by someone who had no right to profit from them," he said. "This behavior cannot be tolerated." Quinnan's case has shed light on the issue of animal theft and the potential risk that can come with posting sensitive information or photos on social media. Law enforcement officials are urging members of the public to be more vigilant and report any suspicious activity involving animals immediately. Meanwhile, local animal protection groups are using this case as a reminder that there are proper channels for acquiring and caring for animals, and that stealing or selling them illegally can cause significant harm to both the animals and their owners. The residents of Lincolnshire are hoping that this case serves as a warning to others who might consider engaging in similar activities.
