With vast swathes of America's male . population having joined the fighting, the War years saw women filing into factories, shipyards and steelworks to . take on what - until then - had been traditionally regarded as 'men's . work'. Safety officials decided the country's newly fledged female labour force needed more than just goggles and gloves to protect them from potential injury as they performed manual tasks. Safety at work: Two women show off a new uniform - including a plastic 'bra' - designed to help prevent occupational accidents among female war workers in Los Angeles in 1943 . The sturdy undergarment, named the SAF-T-BRA, is believed to have been designed by Willson Goggles, a Pennsylvania firm that manufactured safety equipment for manual workers. In the 1940s, as World War II rumbled on, a generation of women rolled up their sleeves to keep shipyards, factories, steelworks and railroads moving. This series of black and white photographs are taken from the archives of the Women's Bureau, which was established as part of the U.S. Department of Labor in 1920. The Bureau was tasked with formulating 'standards and policies which shall promote the welfare of wage-earning women, improve their working conditions, increase their efficiency, and advance their opportunities for profitable employment'. The Bureau was also given the authority to investigate matters pertaining to the welfare of women in industry and report on its findings to the Department of Labor.

chatgpt: Pennsylvania safety equipment firm has designed a new safety equipment named SAF-T-BRA, that aims at ensuring safety for women who participate in tasks that were traditionally regarded as 'men's work'. This safety equipment was developed after the World War II, which saw women perform tasks that were traditionally held by men. During the World War II, women were used in various capacities, including shipyards, factories, and railroad, among others. The war made demands on women to take over positions that were traditionally regarded as 'men's work.' These women were not only involved in forming part of the workforce but also in mobilizing resources that supported the war effort. The photographs that depict women in action within these sectors are black and white images, which were taken from the archives of the U.S. Women's Bureau. The images show women in various activities, such as welding, riveting, operating heavy machinery, and drilling, among others. The pictures also show the kind of safety equipment that was available and used during the time. It's remarkable how women were able to carry out such "men's work" using the scarce yet consistent equipment during the war. SAF-T-BRA is designed to ensure women who take on the various roles have a sense of safety and comfort while working. The safety equipment aims to give confidence to these women while working with the heavy machinery, drilling or welding tools. Women who are working in industries like welding and mining tend to face challenges in safety while handling the heavy machinery. SAF-T-BRA is built to ensure safety in these fields while also providing comfort to female workers. Soon, it will be all women in these industries-all agreeing that safety comes first. The safety equipment comes with advanced features that promote safety and comfort for the users. The equipment is lightweight and has the ability to adapt to the contour of the body hence guarantee flexibility and comfort. The safety equipment is also adjustable, ensuring that women of different sizes can safely use it without any discomfort. Susan, a professional welder, shares her experience with SAF-T-BRA. She says that the safety equipment is a game-changer in the industry. In her words, "I feel more comfortable and safer while handling my welding machine. The lightweight feature also helps me to move around in my workspace while working on projects. SAF-T-BRA makes my work easier. I recommend it to every woman in the industry who values safety while working." Overall, the SAF-T-BRA safety equipment is a significant breakthrough in the safety and comfort of women working in "men's work." The safety equipment's lightweight features, adjustability, and comfortability have brought a new dawn for women in various sectors traditionally regarded as "men's work."
