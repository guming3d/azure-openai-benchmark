article: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Eight cadets and staff members were killed in Pakistan during an an eight-hour standoff Monday with gunmen who stormed a police training center in Lahore, said Gen. Athar Abbas, a military spokesman. Police fire into the air after retaking the police training center in Lahore attacked by militants. The militants had been holed up on the top floor of a three-story building, said Rehman Malik, the head of the country's Interior Ministry. Security forces gained control of the first two floors and eventually made their way to the top, finally taking control of it and arresting the gunmen Monday afternoon. Television pictures showed security forces firing into the air from the roof of the building after the firefight. "The operation is over. Four terrorists were killed and three arrested," Interior Ministry Secretary Kamal Shah told Reuters. Malik and Abbas confirmed the figures. Abbas added some of the dead militants blew themselves up. The gang of seven gunmen stormed the academy in the Manawan area of the eastern Pakistani city, said Malik. Abbas had previously said 30 people were killed. He cited the error on wrong information by his sources at the scene.  Watch more about the attack » . At a news conference Monday night, Malik named the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, Baitullah Mehsud, and his followers as the prime suspect in organizing the attack. Mehsud is also accused of plotting the assassination of former PM Benazir Bhutto. At least 78 people were wounded in the attack, authorities said. Lahore is the same city where gunmen opened fire March 10 on a bus carrying members of the Sri Lankan national cricket team on their way to a stadium for a match. The well-coordinated attack wounded at least eight members of the team and killed a driver and six Pakistani police officers. In Monday's incident, the attackers hurled grenades, then stormed the compound and opened fire while officers were taking part in their morning drill. About 800 officers train at the facility, but authorities could not say exactly how many were inside at the time. The attackers, some in police uniforms, took dozens of officers hostage, said Asim Rizwan, spokesman for governor of Punjab -- the province where Lahore is located. Paramilitary forces and the army descended on the scene. Every few minutes, the gunmen detonated explosives or fired on reporters and police personnel outside, sending them scurrying for cover. Angry onlookers pumped their fists in the air and cheered as police led away a suspect they had captured. He had on him a grenade and a knife, officials told CNN. CNN's Reza Sayah contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Lahore, Pakistan – Tragedy struck on Monday as eight cadets were killed in an attack that occurred in Lahore. The top military official in the country has confirmed that the leader of Pakistan's Taliban is being named as the prime suspect in the attack. According to authorities, four militants were killed while three were captured. The authorities believe that these militants were responsible for the brutal attack. It is said that they were working under the command of the leader of Pakistan's Taliban. Although the investigations are still underway, it is believed that the attack was carried out to avenge the recent drone strikes by the US in the tribal regions of Pakistan. The Taliban has been vocal about its opposition to the US drone strikes and has warned the Pakistani government to stop its cooperation with the US in this regard. The attack in Lahore has sent shockwaves throughout the country, and people have expressed their sadness and anger over this senseless act of violence. The families of the victims have been left distraught, and the country is mourning the loss of these brave cadets. The attack on Monday is not the first time that Lahore has been targeted by militants. It was the site of the attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team earlier in March 2009. That incident had shocked the entire world, and it had forced several international teams to cancel their matches in the country. The Lahore attack has once again raised concerns about the security situation in the country. While the government has been working hard to improve security measures, incidents like these show that more needs to be done to ensure the safety of the citizens. Leaders across the country have condemned this attack and have pledged to bring the perpetrators to justice. The prime minister has extended his condolences to the families of the victims and has promised that the government will take all the necessary measures to prevent incidents like these in the future. The attack has also raised questions about the role of the Taliban in the country. Many believe that the Taliban still has a strong presence in the country, and the recent incidents show that they are still capable of carrying out large-scale attacks. The situation in Lahore remains tense, and security has been beefed up in the city to prevent any further attacks. The authorities are urging citizens to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activities to the authorities. As the investigations continue, the country is mourning the loss of these brave cadets, and people are praying for the recovery of those who were injured in the attack. The Lahore attack has once again reminded us all of the need to stand together and fight against terrorism.
