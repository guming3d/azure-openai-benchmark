article: (CNN) -- Costa Rica's first female candidate held a two-to-one lead in the country's presidential election, as the second-place candidate, Otton Solis of the Citizen's Action Party, conceded defeat. If the PLN -- the Spanish acronym for the ruling National Liberation Party party -- wins, Laura Chinchilla would become the nation's first female president. Polls showed Chinchilla garnering 47.3 percent of the vote, with 24.9 percent of election sites reporting. Solis had 23.3 percent, while Otto Guevara of the Libertarian Movement had 21.9 percent. Before noon Sunday, all three leading candidates had cast their votes in events broadcast live by local media. If none of the candidates gain 40 percent of the vote, a runoff election will be used to select the next president. In addition to president, Costa Ricans also cast ballots Sunday for two vice presidents, 53 congressmen and 495 councilmen. Video footage showed flag-waving supporters of the main presidential candidates dressed in their respective campaign colors throughout the country. International observers interviewed on CNN affiliate Teletica compared the election scene to a festival. The festivities included election sites where children could vote in a mock presidential vote. The educational outreach let the children pick their candidate on a digital ballot not unlike the ones the rest of the electorate cast their votes with. Some 2.8 million Costa Ricans are eligible to vote. The legacy of outgoing President Oscar Arias -- a Nobel laureate who leaves office a popular, if polarizing leader -- has in many ways shaped the presidential race. Although he has given Costa Rica a larger role in foreign affairs through his involvement in seeking resolution to the political crisis in Honduras, but his style has rubbed some the wrong way. After casting his vote Sunday, Arias called the electoral process transparent and trustworthy. "I would like to thank the Costa Rican people for filling the streets with color," he said. CNN's Roberto Pazos contributed to this report.

chatgpt: In the Costa Rican presidential elections, the race is heating up as the final results roll in. So far, it appears that frontrunner Laura Chinchilla of the National Liberation Party is leading with 47.3 percent of the votes, with a quarter of polling sites reporting. However, her closest competition has just announced that they will be bowing out of the race. Antonio Solis, a candidate with 23.3 percent of the votes so far, has officially conceded his defeat. This leaves Chinchilla with a significant lead over the remaining candidates. But the race is not over just yet. In Costa Rica, a candidate must secure at least 40 percent of the vote in order to win outright. If no one reaches this threshold, a runoff election will take place. Chinchilla's campaign platform has emphasized issues such as job creation, public safety, and social welfare. She has promised to continue the policies of the current administration, which has seen economic growth and poverty reduction, while also taking steps to address crime and improve infrastructure. Her win would likely mean stability and continuity for the country, as well as continued engagement with international organizations and foreign investors. However, some critics have expressed concerns about her close ties to the current president, as well as her party's track record on corruption and inequality. Meanwhile, the other candidates trailing behind Chinchilla and Solis have yet to announce whether they will be conceding or continuing their campaigns. It remains to be seen whether a runoff election will be necessary, or if Chinchilla will secure the necessary votes to become the next president of Costa Rica. Regardless of the outcome, this election has highlighted the importance of issues such as economic development, social welfare, and security in the minds of Costa Rican voters. It remains to be seen how the country will move forward, but the results of this election are sure to have a significant impact on Costa Rican politics and society for years to come.
