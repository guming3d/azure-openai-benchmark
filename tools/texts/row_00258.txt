Across the globe tonight, many will pack a duffel bag. In it: a camera, tripod, flashlights, telescope, perhaps a blanket and maybe some snacks before setting off in search of the perfect location for a late-night photo shoot.

"There's just so much out there that people don't realize that you can see without the equipment being expensive, if you just slow down a minute and take a peek."
