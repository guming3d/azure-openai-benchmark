chatgpt: Every year on the first of May, the small town of Cocullo, Italy, is transformed into a sea of serpents for the traditional "Festa dei Serpari." The event, which has been held in the town for centuries, centers around a statue of Saint Domenic, known for his healing powers.  The statue of Saint Domenic is covered with over thirty live snakes, while hundreds more can be found in the crowd. The serpents, which are non-poisonous and have had their fangs removed prior to the event, are seen as a symbol of Saint Domenic's power over evil and his ability to heal those who are sick.  The festival has its roots in ancient pagan traditions, which saw the serpent as a symbol of wealth, fertility and the healing arts. The transformation into a Christian celebration happened when an image of Saint Domenic was added to the festival.  The procession through the medieval town of Cocullo is a sight to behold, with the statue of Saint Domenic and his cargo of snakes being paraded through the narrow streets. The statue is carried by participants who wear traditional garb and are believed to be endowed with special powers.  Despite the unusual nature of the Festa dei Serpari, the event is a major draw for both locals and tourists. Cocullo, which has a population of only 285 people, sees thousands of visitors flocking to the town to witness the spectacle.  The festival has not been without controversy, however. In recent years, animal rights activists have raised concerns over the treatment of the live snakes involved in the event. However, organizers have defended the tradition, stating that the snakes are well-cared for and that their participation in the festival is purely symbolic.  The Festa dei Serpari is just one of many unique festivals and traditions that Italy has to offer. Each year, thousands of tourists visit the country to experience these cultural events and learn more about the rich history and traditions of Italy.  As the festival draws to a close, participants and spectators alike are left with a sense of wonder and awe. The Festa dei Serpari is a reminder of the power of tradition and the enduring human fascination with the natural world.
