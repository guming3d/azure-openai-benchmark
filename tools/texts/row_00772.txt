article: (CNN) -- In 1979, Jarreth Merz, then a young boy in Ghana, saw the dramatic results of a military coup. Watching on an old black and white television set, he and a group of his friends witnessed one of the nation's generals being blindfolded and shot to death by a firing squad. Shortly afterward, his family fled the instability of Ghana and returned to his native Switzerland. But Africa stayed with Merz, who told his story at the TED Global conference in Edinburgh, UK, in July. He grew up to become an actor and found that he was increasingly being cast as a violent African or a terrorist. "How many terrorists could I possibly play before turning into one myself?" "I had become ashamed of the other, the African in me." After 28 years, Merz returned to Ghana to film the nation's 2008 presidential election and, as it turned out, to learn more about himself. "I realized that, when I'd left the country, free and fair elections in a democratic environment were a dream. And now that I'd returned, that dream had become reality, though a fragile reality." In the first round of voting in Ghana, no candidate attained the 50% of the vote needed to gain the presidency, and an inconclusive runoff was held. People began questioning whether the elections were being manipulated. Merz said there was gunfire and he saw discouraging signs of a possible breakdown in civil order. "And my heart sank, because I thought, here we are again. Here is another proof that the African is not capable of governing himself. And not only that, I am documenting it -- documenting my own cultural shortcomings." But rather than erupt in violence, the crowd started chanting "We want peace," and eventually, after new voting, a winner was certified and power was transferred peacefully, Merz said. "Ghana taught me to look at people differently and to look at myself differently. And yes, we Africans can." In his film, "An African Election," Merz told CNN in an interview, "The political system, the democratic system, is tested to the utmost." The lesson: "You don't have to rebel. You have the freedom to choose, and with that choice comes a responsibility."

chatgpt: Jarreth Merz, a filmmaker who witnessed the violent coup in Ghana as a boy, returned to his birthplace in 2008 to document the country's election. After a close vote and a runoff, a winner was declared and power was peacefully transferred. Merz believes that this election helped to demonstrate that democracy is indeed viable in Africa. Ghana's 2008 election was a critical moment for the country, and one that Merz was determined to witness firsthand. As he explains in an interview with The Guardian, he wanted to see how Ghana's democracy would fare when tested by a close and contested election. He was also interested in exploring how the election would affect Ghana's reputation as one of the most stable and prosperous countries in West Africa. Merz's resulting film, "An African Election," captures the drama and tension of the election campaign, as well as the excitement that accompanied the eventual victory of John Atta Mills. At the same time, the film also explores the ways in which Ghana's political culture has evolved over time. Some of the country's most prominent political figures, including former president Jerry Rawlings, make appearances in the film, sharing their insights into how Ghana's democracy has changed since the days of the coups and military dictatorships that plagued the country in the past. Merz believes that the success of Ghana's 2008 election can serve as a model for other African countries seeking to strengthen their own democratic institutions. As he explained to The Guardian, "When democracy works, it is a beautiful thing. And by showing that Ghana could hold a free and fair election, we are proving that democracy is indeed possible in Africa." Of course, the road to democracy is not always smooth, and Ghana has faced its share of challenges in the years since the 2008 election. Nonetheless, Merz's film remains a powerful testament to the belief that democracy can thrive in even the most challenging of circumstances. By telling the story of Ghana's 2008 election, Merz has helped to shed light on the many struggles and triumphs that lie ahead as Africa continues to work toward a more democratic future.
