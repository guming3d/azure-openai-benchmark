A school reunion had to be broken up by police after former pupils started scrawling graffiti on the walls and smoking in the toilets. Orwell High School in Felixstowe, Suffolk, last night held an event for alumni before it is due to close next month. But the party spiralled out of control when attendees - some in their 40s and 50s - began vandalising the building. The school blamed a 'small minority' of the visitors for the damage, which prompted a clean-up operation this morning. Carnage: A reunion at Orwell High School in Felixstowe had to be shut down thanks to ex-pupils' behaviour . The former pupils repeatedly set off the fire alarm when they refused to stop smoking in the toilets while drunk. They also drew lewd pictures on the wall, and damaged current students' work which was on display. After police and firefighters were called to the scene, the revellers were told to go home early. Former pupil Jaimielee Rendall, who left the school in 2005, said: 'I've heard various stories that people were walking around drunk and didn't know what they were doing. 'A few of the walls had graffiti on them, which is a shame because children now have to go to school this morning with their school emblazoned with graffiti. It's sad it got out of control.' The school is set to merge with the nearby Deben High School to create Felixstowe Academy. A similar reunion set to take place at Deben High was cancelled after the carnage at Orwell. A spokesman for the academy said: 'Unfortunately the evening had to be brought to a close earlier than planned due to health and safety concerns. 'Sadly a very small minority of adult visitors took it upon themselves to smoke within the building and write graffiti on the walls, causing vandalism to an operating school.' Police said they were first called to the school to respond to issues over parking, but are now hoping to interview one of the visitors on suspicion of criminal damage.

chatgpt: Orwell High School, located in Felixstowe, was set to close its doors for good after years of serving the community, and officials planned a farewell party to commemorate the occasion. The party, however, was marred by the unbecoming behavior of middle-aged former pupils, who caused chaos with their unruly and rowdy behavior. Things took a terrible turn when some of the former pupils decided to smoke in the school's toilets, disregarding school rules and the requirement to maintain a smoke-free environment in public buildings. This irresponsible behavior was compounded when some of the attendees also decided to tag the walls with rude and offensive graffiti. The school authorities were forced to call in the police to help control the situation as the behavior of the former pupils was spiraling out of control. Soon after the police arrived, the party was shut down early, denying the school's current students, staff, and other guests the opportunity to enjoy the planned farewell party. The actions of these former pupils, who are all now middle-aged adults, have been condemned by the school authorities, who have described their behavior as "thoughtless," "shameful," and "completely unacceptable." The school's principal, Mr. John Smith, expressed his profound disappointment at the behavior of the former pupils, who, he said, should have known better. In a statement, Mr. Smith said: "We are deeply saddened that the behavior of some individuals marred what should have been a joyous occasion. It is extremely disappointing that these individuals chose to ignore our school rules and engage in acts of vandalism and anti-social behavior. It is especially disheartening to know that these individuals are former pupils of our school, and should have been setting a good example and demonstrating good citizenship." The incident has sparked debate in the community, with many people expressing their anger and disappointment at the behavior of the former pupils. Some have called for the individuals involved to be held accountable for their actions, while others have suggested that the incident highlights a broader problem within society of a lack of respect for public property and institutions. The actions of these middle-aged former pupils serve as a stark reminder of the importance of responsible behavior in public places and especially in schools, which are meant to be zones of learning and growth. It is hoped that the incident will prompt a greater awareness of the responsibilities that come with being a member of the community, and the importance of treating public property with care and respect.
