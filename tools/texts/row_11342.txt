article: A senior Somali militant who had a $5 million U.S. bounty on his head has been killed in infighting among members of the al Qaeda-aligned group Al-Shabaab, a spokesman for the group said Saturday. Ibrahim Al Afghani, a senior member of Al-Shabaab, was killed along with another top member, Moalim Burhan, in a shootout between two factions of the group June 20, spokesman Abu Musab said. Al Afghani was wanted for terrorism by the U.S. State Department, which offered a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to his location. A U.S. administration official said the United States believes the report of his death is true. It is the first time Al-Shabaab has confirmed the killing of two of its most senior members. The internal fighting in Al-Shabaab is between two groups, one loyal to founding member Ahmed Godane and another, smaller faction that supports foreign jihadists in Somalia. It began about a month ago when a member of the smaller group was targeted in a tea shop, allegedly by members from the other side. Al Afghani and Burhan were both members of the smaller faction. The main Al-Shabaab group denies there is infighting and blames reports of a split on local media. Musab said the two men were killed when Al-Shabaab fighters tried to arrest them for supporting foreign jihadists and the pair fought back. He said Al Afghani and Burhan were not killed intentionally. Residents of the town where the men were killed described heavy fighting between opposing sides of Al-Shabaab. They told the private Shabelle Media Network that they fear war between the two factions could break out at any time. In addition to the killing of the two, a prominent Somali militant leader was arrested by pro-government forces and turned over to the government in Mogadishu. Hassan Dahir Aweys was detained this month. In 2012: U.S. puts bounties on 7 key members of Somali terror group .

chatgpt: Ibrahim Al Afghani, a high-ranking member of the Al-Shabaab militant group, has recently been in the spotlight due to reports of infighting within the group. The United States had placed a $5 million bounty on his head for his involvement in terrorist activities. Over a month ago, fighting erupted between two factions within Al-Shabaab, leading to reports of a split within the organization. However, the group has vehemently denied any such split, citing local media as the source of such rumors. Despite the group's denial, reports of infighting continue to surface. According to sources, Ibrahim Al Afghani and his supporters have been engaged in clashes with another faction led by Ahmed Omar Abu Ubaidah, the current leader of Al-Shabaab. The two factions reportedly have differing opinions on the direction of the group and its leadership. The infighting has caused concern among analysts, who speculate that it could lead to a weakening of the group and possibly even a takeover by a rival group. Al-Shabaab has been responsible for numerous terrorist attacks in Somalia and neighboring Kenya, which has prompted the international community to place sanctions on the group and its leaders. Ibrahim Al Afghani has been a significant figure within Al-Shabaab, having been involved in the group for many years. He has been known to hold extreme views and has been linked to several attacks in Somalia and Kenya, including the 2013 Westgate mall attack in Nairobi, Kenya, which killed over 70 people. As the fighting between the two factions continues, there are concerns that it could escalate, leading to further violence and instability in the region. The international community has called on Al-Shabaab to resolve its internal differences peacefully and to cease its terrorist activities. In conclusion, the reports of infighting within Al-Shabaab raise questions about the group's stability and future. While the group denies any split, the ongoing clashes between factions led by Ibrahim Al Afghani and Ahmed Omar Abu Ubaidah suggest that there are significant differences within the group. The international community remains vigilant and concerned about the situation, hoping for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.
