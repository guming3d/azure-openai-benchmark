Scroll down for video . Convicted terrorist Mohammad Cholili was released from Lowokwaru Prison in Malang, East Java, Indonesia on Wednesday . 'Muhammad Cholili has been released on parole today after several remissions which he received for good behaviour. He has never broken any prison regulations,' the justice ministry's prisons spokeswoman Ika Yusanti told AFP. Sentences are routinely cut in Indonesia to mark major religious celebrations such as Eid al-Fitr Muslim holiday and the country's independence day on August 17. This meant that Cholili served only around half of his term, but Yusanti said that his release has 'received the recommendation from the Detachment 88 and the National Anti-Terror Agency', which are responsible for tracking terror activities in the country. Yusanti also added that the authorities would continue to monitor Cholili's activities and he will not be able to leave Indonesia without the justice minister's approval.

Sentenced to 18 years for his involvement in the bombing, his sentence was reduced for good behaviour . 'If he commits any crime or creates any problems in the community, he will be sent back to prison,' she added. Indonesia's English daily The Jakarta Globe reported that Cholili was surprised to learn of his release from the Lowokwaru Prison in Malang, East Java, but was happy to leave prison. 'The most important thing is to go home and meet my family,' he was quoted as saying by the newspaper. Indonesia, the world's biggest Muslim-majority nation, has long struggled with terrorism but a successful clampdown in recent years has prevented major deadly attacks. However, recent reports of Indonesians joining the procession of jihadists to Syria and Iraq have sparked fears that they will revive sophisticated militant networks.

chatgpt: Bali bomber Muhammad Cholili was released from jail on Wednesday after serving almost nine years for his role in helping organise one of the deadliest attacks in Indonesia's history. The bombing in 2005 killed 20 people and injured more than 100 others. Cholili was sentenced to 18 years in prison for helping the ringleaders behind the attack, but with time served and good behavior, he was granted early release. The attack shocked the world and brought international attention to Indonesia's struggles with terrorism. It was carried out by a group of Islamic militants who targeted two popular nightclubs in the Kuta area of Bali. Cholili was one of several people arrested and charged for their roles in the attack. He was accused of providing logistical support, including renting a house where the bombs were made, buying chemicals, and conducting surveillance on the targets. Despite his involvement in the attack, Cholili maintained his innocence throughout his trial and attempted to appeal his sentence several times. However, his requests were denied, and he was forced to serve out his full sentence. The government has defended its decision to release Cholili, citing his good behavior and rehabilitation efforts while in jail. However, the move has sparked controversy, with many victims' families and human rights advocates expressing outrage and frustration. One such person is I Wayan Sudirta, who lost his daughter and niece in the attack. "It's very frustrating to see someone who played a role in such a horrific act be released from prison so soon," he said. "It feels like a slap in the face to the victims and their families." Human rights groups have also criticised the decision, arguing that terrorists should serve out their full sentences as a deterrent to others considering similar attacks. However, the government has stressed that Cholili will remain under strict supervision and will be required to undergo rehabilitation programs aimed at preventing him from relapsing into extremism. Cholili's release comes amid growing concern over the rise of extremist groups in Indonesia, with the country's government cracking down on radicalisation and increasing surveillance efforts to prevent future attacks. As the nation struggles to come to terms with its past and prevent future violence, the release of Bali bomber Muhammad Cholili serves as a stark reminder of the devastating impact of terrorism and the challenges of balancing justice, rehabilitation, and public safety.
