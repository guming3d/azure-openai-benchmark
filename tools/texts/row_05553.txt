article: If you're using a fake name on your Facebook account, maintaining a personal profile for your beloved pet or have a second profile you use just for logging in to other sites, you have one of the 83.09 million fake accounts Facebook wants to disable. In an updated regulatory filing released Wednesday, the social media company said that 8.7 percent of its 955 million monthly active users worldwide are actually duplicate or false accounts. "On Facebook we have a really large commitment in general to finding and disabling false accounts," Facebook's chief security officer Joe Sullivan told CNN in a recent interview. "Our entire platform is based on people using their real identities." Facebook inspires status envy . So what are those 83 million undesired accounts doing? They're a mixture of innocent and malicious, and Facebook has divvied them up into three categories: duplicate accounts, misclassified accounts and "undesirable" accounts. Duplicate accounts make up 4.8% (45.8 million) of Facebook's total active member tally. According to the network's terms of service, users are not allowed to have more than one Facebook personal account or make accounts on behalf of other people. Parents creating Facebook accounts for their young kids are violating two rules, since people under 13 are not allowed to have Facebook profiles. Misclassified accounts are personal profiles that have been made for companies, groups or pets. Those types of profiles (22.9 million) are allowed on Facebook, but they need to be created as Pages. Facebook estimates that 2.4% of its active accounts are these non-human personal accounts. These accounts can be converted into approved pages without losing information. Pets such as Boo, the self-anointed "world's cutest dog," are typically classified as Public Figures. The third group is the smallest -- just 1.5% of all active accounts -- but most troublesome. There are 14.3 million undesirable accounts that Facebook believes have been created specifically for purposes that violate the companies terms, like spamming. Face it, Facebook: Sometimes you suck . "We believe the percentage of accounts that are duplicate or false is meaningfully lower in developed markets such as the United States or Australia and higher in developing markets such as Indonesia and Turkey," the company said in the filing. The tallies were based on an internal sampling of accounts done by reviewers, and Facebook says the numbers may represent the actual number. Facebook disables any false accounts it finds, and while it wipes all the information associated with the name from public view, it doesn't delete the account from its servers "for safety and security" reasons. The disabled account goes into a sort of Facebook limbo, where the owner of the account can't get their hands on any of the content -- photos, posts, videos -- not even by requesting a copy of the data, according to Facebook. If Facebook does shut down your account, it says you can't create a new one without permission from the company. Complete coverage: Facebook .

chatgpt: Facebook, the social media giant, has been working hard to maintain its credibility and protect users from numerous undesirable accounts. According to recent reports, fake and duplicate profiles, along with spam accounts, currently make up 8.7% of Facebook's active pages. However, the company has been relentless in identifying and disabling these types of accounts to ensure the best experience for its users. Recently, Facebook reported that it has removed a whopping 14.3 million undesirable accounts, which were created for purposes such as spamming. These accounts are usually created to send out unsolicited messages and posts, often with malicious intent. Given the size of Facebook's user base, it's no wonder that the company is considered an easy target by spammers and hackers. To combat this problem, Facebook has put in place several measures to identify fraudsters and spammers. One of the primary defenses is an automated system that works 24/7 to detect and remove threats. This system uses algorithms to identify fake or duplicate profiles and tracks how they are being used. By analyzing user behavior, the system can identify patterns and malicious activity, allowing Facebook to block or disable suspicious accounts. Facebook also encourages its users to report any false, suspicious or unwanted activity. Once a complaint is received, Facebook investigates the report to take necessary action. While this approach is not always foolproof, it is a useful way for users to flag undesirable behaviour. In addition to these protections, Facebook has also implemented strict verification processes for new users. For instance, the social media platform uses a combination of facial recognition technology and government-issued identification to verify new accounts. This verification process helps to reduce the number of fake accounts being created on Facebook. To show the effectiveness of these measures, Facebook cites that it can now detect and disable accounts within minutes of suspicious activity. The company claims that it's always improving these measures, and that it remains a constant battle to keep users safe from spam and fraudulent content. Beyond reducing the number of spammers and scammers on the platform, Facebook's efforts have also helped user engagement. By reducing spam-related content, users are less likely to be overwhelmed by messages and posts that have nothing to do with their interests. This, in turn, increases the quality of content shared on the platform, making it more attractive to advertisers and users alike. Facebook's position on the threat of spam and fraudulent accounts is clear: the company has a zero-tolerance policy towards accounts that engage in spam or harassing behavior. Through a combination of automated systems and user reporting, the company and its team continue to work to eliminate fraudulent accounts while protecting its genuine users. In conclusion, Facebook remains one of the largest social media platforms in the world, attracting millions of users each day. However, while the company has put in place significant measures to protect its users, its scale means that it remains a target for spammers and fraudsters. Today's announcement of the disabling of over 14 million undesirable accounts is a testament to Facebook's commitment to maintaining the integrity of its platform. Facebook has set a benchmark for social media platforms across the world in terms of trustworthiness, and it's sure to continue working towards that goal.
