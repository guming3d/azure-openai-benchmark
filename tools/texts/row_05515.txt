Novelist Joanna Trollope said children should return to reading classics such as Austen and the Bronte sisters . Joanna Trollope says children should be taught literary classics in school because they spend too much time reading fantasy books, such as The Twilight Saga. The novelist said fantasy teen fiction, such as the hugely popular Hunger Games series, fails to give children an insight into reality or guidance in moral dilemmas. The Rector's Wife author said youngsters should be encouraged to read the likes of Jane Austen, George Eliot and the Bronte sisters. However, she admitted her 12-year-old grandson loves The Hunger Games, about a post-apocalyptic nation in which two children are selected to compete to the death in an annual televised battle. Trollope told The Sunday Times: 'I feel children are missing out on an enormous amount. 'The consolation to be found in the classics is absolutely infinite and greater than fantasy novels. Fantasy doesn't relate to the real world.' The author, who used to be a teacher, said using popular culture can be a useful tool to lead children towards the classics. She said she gave her class The Beatles lyrics to study in one English poetry class before giving them Robert Frost to read. Last year, the three Hunger Games books were in the top 10 bestsellers list with more than 2.1million sold. Trollope said classic British novels can provide guidance to children and help them with decisions. Trollope is one of six authors invited by the Austen Project to rewrite her works for a modern audience. Trollope said books like The Hunger Games (Jennifer Lawrence, pictured left, as Katniss Everdeen) and The Twilight Saga (Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson in the film version, right) do not 'relate to the real world' Trollope has rewritten Sense and Sensibility (pictured Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet in the 1995 film) for a modern audience. She said the book's themes are still relevant today . She is working on Sense and Sensibility and said issues the book tackles, such as class and money, are still important today. In her updated version, Elinor Dashwood is an architecture student while her creative sister Marianne goes to art school. It includes social media, iPods and fast cars. Other contemporary writers involved in the project are Alexander McCall Smith (Emma), Val McDermid (Northanger Abbey), U.S. writer Curtis Sittenfeld (Pride and Prejudice). Two other writers will be named later this year.

chatgpt: Anthony Trollope, the famous 19th-century author, has expressed his opinion on the popular genre of fantasy novels. He argued that books like Twilight, which involve supernatural and fantastical elements, do not "relate to the real world." Instead, Trollope believed that novels by classic authors such as Jane Austen or the Bronte sisters give young readers the moral guidance they need to navigate the complexities of life. Trollope made his comments during an interview with a local newspaper in London. He expressed concern that young readers were being taken in by stories that had no connection to the real world. "Fantasy novels may be entertaining," he said, "but they don't offer the kind of guidance that young people need." He went on to explain that "the novels of Austen or the Bronte sisters, for example, give us a window into the real world. They offer us lessons on how to navigate relationships, how to live with integrity, and how to find happiness in a complex and often challenging world." Trollope's comments are sure to spark a debate among literary circles, with many fans of fantasy novels likely to disagree with his assessment. However, Trollope's assertion that classic novels have a unique ability to teach and guide readers is not a new concept. Many scholars have argued that fiction can be a powerful tool for moral education, helping readers to develop empathy, understanding, and critical thinking skills. In fact, some experts have even suggested that reading classic literature can help young people lead more fulfilling lives. Studies have shown that readers who engage with literature from an early age are more likely to have strong relationships, successful careers, and a sense of purpose and meaning in life. Despite the ongoing debate about the value of different genres of literature, Trollope's comments serve as a reminder that reading is a powerful tool for personal growth and development. Whether readers prefer the escapism of fantasy or the realism of classic literature, the act of reading itself can help them to better understand themselves and the world around them. As such, Trollope's comments can be seen as a call to action for young readers everywhere. Whether they are reading Twilight or Wuthering Heights, they should be encouraged to engage deeply with the stories they encounter, to think critically about the messages they contain, and to use what they learn to make the most of their lives.
