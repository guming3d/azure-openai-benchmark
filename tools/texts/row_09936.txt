article: Former England skipper Terry Butcher has been sacked by Hibs after less than seven months in charge of the Edinburgh outfit. The Easter Road club were relegated to the Championship – the second tier of Scottish football – after an atrocious run of results culminated in them losing a relegation-promotion play-off with Hamilton. Hibs chairman Rod Petrie and chief executive Leeann Dempster met with Butcher on Monday, with the board then unanimously agreeing to dispense with his services today. Gone: Former England skipper Terry Butcher has been sacked following Hibs' relegation to the Championship . Dempster said: 'I have to say that we all regret that this decision had to be made, but during conversation it became clear that a different approach was needed. 'Sadly, for a variety of reasons and perhaps including unfortunate timing, it hasn't worked out for Terry here. That is disappointing for all concerned. I am genuinely saddened that we have had to take this tough decision. 'It may have taken longer than we all would have liked but I felt it was appropriate that we met properly and had a full discussion before any decision was made. 'Now we need to move forward and act to bring in a new manager with the aim of getting us promoted back to where Hibernian belongs, in the top league of Scottish football, from a uniquely competitive Championship. Moving on: Hibs will now bid to find a successor to Butcher who was sacked after just seven months in charge . 'Our first aim must be to try to win the league and gain promotion automatically. 'The search now begins to find and appoint the next manager, and while we will try to keep supporters updated regarding the process as much as we can, I know they will understand that we need to be professional in all that we do. 'Unfortunately, assistant manager Maurice Malpas is abroad on holiday at present and I want to meet him on his return to explain the situation at the club.' Hibs' promotion back to the Premiership is far from guaranteed next term with city rivals Hearts also relegated this season and fallen giants Rangers promoted to the Championship after winning the League One title.
