article: It has long been thought that first-born children are more successful and ambitious than their younger brothers and sisters. But a new study has revealed that the elder child's achievements can help boost their younger siblings exam results by helping them to raise their game, which in turn can help them eclipse the first born's success. Researchers are calling it the 'sibling spillover effect' and could point to why top tennis player Jamie Murray was eclipsed by his younger brother Andy and why Ed Miliband clinched the Labour party leadership instead of his older brother David. Top tennis player Jamie Murray, right, was eventually outclassed by his younger brother Andy, who has won two grand slam titles . For the first time ever, academics from the University of Essex examined how the success of first born children in school impacted on their younger brothers and sisters by studying primary school test results and then GCSE scores. And the data showed that having an older brother or sister boosted a child's learning with the effect the equivalent of spending an extra £670 on the younger sibling's schooling. The effect is even more pronounced in less well-off families showing poorer children benefit more from a having high-attaining older sibling. Older Miliband brother David, right, was tipped to be the Labour party leader but was pipped to the post by younger brother Ed . One of the study's authors Birgitta Rabe explained: 'The older sibling’s achievement may have a direct effect on the younger sibling’s school grades if the older sibling teaches the younger sibling or helps with homework; the younger sibling imitates the older sibling, for example in their work style, or conversely tries to be different, for example to avoid competition the older sibling passes on important information about educational choices or school and teachers to the younger sibling. 'We find that the spillover effect is larger for siblings in families eligible for free school meals, living in deprived neighbourhoods and speaking a language other than English at home. 'This means that children from more deprived backgrounds benefit more from a high attaining older sibling than children from more affluent backgrounds.' Now along with fellow author of the study, Cheti Nicoletti, Ms Rabe explained that it showed how investing in in children may have multiplier effects through their impact on younger relatives. Previous studies have seemed to suggest that first borns are usually more successful than their brothers and sisters and often have traits of being more organised and responsible as well as being keen to being in charge. While last borns are often described as more rebellious, outgoing, charming and more dependent on others. Earlier this year another study by the University of Essex suggested that firstborn girls are statistically more likely to be the most highly qualified of all their family. The research found older females are 13 per cent more ambitious then firstborn sons.

chatgpt: A recent study conducted by researchers at the University of Essex has found that older siblings play a crucial role in helping younger siblings to excel academically. The study, which has been named 'sibling spillover' by the researchers, suggests that younger children are often motivated to outperform their older siblings, leading to higher academic achievement overall. The researchers conducted their study by analyzing data from the British Household Panel Survey, which included responses from over 2,500 families with children between the ages of 7 and 16. The study focused specifically on the impact that older siblings had on the academic achievement of their younger siblings. According to the findings, younger children in families with older siblings were more likely to outperform their older siblings academically. This effect was especially pronounced in larger families that were less well-off, suggesting that older siblings may play an even more important role in helping younger siblings to succeed in those contexts. The researchers suggest that one reason for this 'sibling spillover' effect is because older siblings help younger children by teaching them. The older siblings may serve as role models for their younger siblings, demonstrating the benefits of hard work and academic achievement. Additionally, older siblings may provide emotional support and encouragement, helping younger siblings to feel more confident and motivated to succeed. The study's lead author, Dr. Feifei Bu, noted that the findings have important implications for policy and practice. "Our study suggests that older siblings can have a powerful positive impact on the academic achievement of their younger siblings," Dr. Bu explained. "This suggests that policies and programs aimed at supporting families and promoting education may want to focus specifically on the role that older siblings play in shaping educational outcomes." The findings of the study also have practical implications for parents and educators. Parents may want to encourage older siblings to take an active role in teaching and supporting their younger siblings. Educators, on the other hand, may want to explore ways to leverage sibling relationships in the classroom, such as by pairing older and younger students together for collaborative learning activities. Interestingly, the study also found that the 'sibling spillover' effect was only observed in families with two or more children. In families with only one child, there was no significant effect of having an older or younger sibling. Overall, the findings suggest that siblings play an important role in shaping academic achievement. By supporting and teaching their younger siblings, older siblings can help to foster a culture of learning and achievement within the family. Moving forward, policymakers, educators, and parents alike can seek to leverage siblings' sibling relationships as a means of encouraging academic success for all children.
