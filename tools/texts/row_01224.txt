article: You can't escape the headlines. An Australian going to college in the United States is gunned down by teens who police say killed him out of boredom. A few days later, a World War II veteran is beaten to death for reasons still unknown. The death of Australian Christopher Lane in Duncan, Oklahoma, even sparked calls for Aussies to boycott travel to the United States because of all the violence. Two shocking, high-profile crimes, one question:  "What the hell is going on!?" Facebook user Stacey James Gordon wrote on CNN's Facebook page. "This country better wake up ...our youth have serious issues," Heather Chesser wrote. Although the cases have struck a nerve with their disturbing randomness and apparent cruelty, the reality is that living in the United States may never have been safer, and you're much more likely to be the victim of a crime committed by someone you know than you are to be assaulted by a stranger. Nearly eight of every 10 murders in the United States between 1993 and 2008 were committed by someone the victim knew, according a 2010 report by the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics. The report didn't include figures for 2011 or 2012. Similarly, nearly two out of every three nonviolent crimes were committed by someone the victim knew. Pair that with figures on overall crime: According to the FBI, the violent crime rate in the United States is about half what it was in 1992. And between 1992 and 2011, the annual number of murders in the United States fell from 23,760 to 14,612 despite a growing population. Rape, robbery, assault, even property crimes also fell in a well-documented decline that has gone on for years, albeit with a small upturn in 2012. Criminologists have cited shifts in the crack cocaine market, which drove many 1990s-era murders; an increase in the number of offenders behind bars; the country's aging population; and more sophisticated policing for the declines. But perceptions of crime haven't always followed the reality. In May, a Pew Research Center study found that 56% of Americans believe that gun violence is higher than it was 20 year ago, even though it has fallen precipitously since the 1990s. And in 2011, Gallup found that 68% of Americans believed crime was getting worse, despite the reality of declining crime rates nationwide.

chatgpt: Recent studies have shown that crime rates in the United States have been declining for years. Experts have attributed this trend to a variety of factors, including increased police presence, stricter sentencing laws, and changes in social and economic conditions. Despite this positive development, many Americans are still worried about crime. In fact, research suggests that people's perception of crime often doesn't match the statistics. Even though crime is actually on the decline, a significant number of U.S. residents believe that it is getting worse. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is the way that crime is reported in the media. News outlets tend to focus on sensational or high-profile crimes, which can create the impression that crime is more common or severe than it actually is. This perception can lead to fear and anxiety among the public, even if the chances of falling victim to a crime are actually quite low. Another factor that may contribute to the mismatch between statistics and perception is people's personal experiences with crime. According to research, most crimes are committed by individuals known to the victims. This means that people who have been victimized in the past may be more likely to perceive crime as a serious issue, even if overall crime rates are down. Despite these challenges, experts agree that it is important for people to have an accurate understanding of crime rates in their communities. This can help to reduce fear and anxiety, and empower individuals to take steps to protect themselves and their families. Some experts suggest that one way to address the perception-vs.-reality problem is by providing more accessible and transparent data about crime rates. This could include public-facing databases or online dashboards that show crime statistics in real time, broken down by location and type of crime. By making this information more readily available, individuals may be better equipped to make informed decisions about their safety and well-being. Overall, while crime rates have been declining for years, it is clear that perception of crime doesn't always match statistics. By taking steps to address this discrepancy, we can work towards creating a safer and more informed society for all.
