Chemist Direct claims that sales of products such as Slimfast and BioBurn have risen by 46 per cent . If you are frantically trying to get in shape for the summer after a failed New Year diet, you are not alone. An online pharmacy has reported that demand for slimming products has soared in the last month. Chemist Direct claims that sales of such products were 46 per cent higher in March than they were in January. Omar El-Gohary, Superintendent Pharmacist at Chemist Direct, said: ‘These are boomerang dieters who with the best intentions started dieting in January, but gave up after a few weeks. 'With summer around the corner, they are now having another go.’ The figures come after a survey by weight loss firm XLS-Medical revealed that the vast majority of people fail to stick to their diets for more than five days a week. It also found that 20 per cent of dieters admit to having their first diet relapse just four days into their diet. Most reported that hunger was the main reason for their diet failure. Chemist Direct believes that the rise in demand for slimming products such as Slimfast, Alli and Bioburn may have been caused by people wanting to get in shape for beach holidays in the May half term. Easter may also have played a part, with people returning to the fattening foods they had given up for Lent. Mr El-Gohary explained that overindulgence at Easter is likely to be a cause as Chemist Direct has also seen a surge in sales of indigestion treatments such as Alka-Seltzer and Rennie. The company says many of these people are 'boomerang dieters' who started dieting in January with the best intentions, but gave up after a few weeks . He said: ‘Indigestion causes pain or . discomfort in the stomach and chest after eating and other symptoms . include nausea, heartburn and feeling bloated. ‘We saw a rise in the number of customers contacting us for advice on treating indigestion, and many admitted they had overindulged on rich foods and were suffering as a result.’ Based on orders, Chemist Direct has compiled a top ten of indigestion hotspots in the UK, with the top place going to Liverpool, closely followed by London and Brighton. Also making the top ten were Bristol, Manchester, Birmingham, Coventry, Stirling, Wigan and Blackburn.

chatgpt: Sales of diet products have skyrocketed by 46% according to online pharmacy Chemist Direct. This increase in sales is largely due to people who started dieting in January and failed to maintain their resolutions. As summer approaches, these individuals are now frantically trying to slim down and get the desired beach body. The new year is often seen as a fresh start, with many people setting goals to improve their health and wellbeing. Unfortunately, for many, these resolutions are short-lived and by mid-February, old habits have crept back in. This is evident in the surge of demand for diet products at Chemist Direct, with the majority of customers indicating that they started a diet in January, but fell off the wagon soon after. With summer fast approaching, individuals are now rushing to get back on track and achieve their weight loss goals. The fear of revealing their “winter bodies” at the beach or pool is a significant motivator, and it’s no surprise that sales of diet products have surged as a result. Chemist Direct has reported that the most significant increase in sales is for meal replacement products and slimming aids. These products offer a quick and easy way to reduce calorie intake and achieve weight loss, without the need for complicated meal planning or cooking. One factor that has contributed to the rise in demand for diet products is the trend of “body positivity.” While this movement encourages people to embrace their bodies and love themselves as they are, it has also led to a backlash against dieting and weight loss. As a result, many people feel guilty or ashamed about wanting to lose weight and may be reluctant to seek help from healthcare professionals. Buying diet products online offers a discreet way for individuals to achieve their goals without feeling judged or stigmatized. As the summer months approach, it’s likely that sales of diet products will continue to rise. The desire to achieve a beach-ready body is a powerful motivator, and people are willing to invest in products that promise quick results. However, it’s important to remember that sustainable weight loss requires a holistic approach, including a healthy diet, exercise, and a positive mindset. Overall, sales of diet products have surged by 46% at Chemist Direct, with the majority of customers indicating that they started a diet in January but failed to maintain their resolutions. As summer approaches, individuals are eager to slim down and achieve their desired beach body, fuelling demand for meal replacement products and slimming aids. While buying diet products online offers a discreet way to achieve weight loss goals, it’s essential to adopt a sustainable and holistic approach to achieve long-term success.
