Deportation appeal: Xiu Fang Zhang (right) leaves court with her partner, children and interpreter. She came to Britain in 2003 and was refused asylum shortly after her arrival . Earlier this year Mrs Zhang, of Newport, South Wales, was refused leave to remain in Britain, meaning she and her family are under threat of deportation to China. Now, arguing her children could be taken from her if she is sent back to her homeland, Mrs Zhang has mounted a judicial review challenge to the Home Office's decision at the High Court in London. Judge James Dingemans QC told the court that Mrs Zhang flew into Gatwick airport in September 2003, but her asylum application was rejected despite her claims she was from the persecuted Falun Gong religious minority. During her years in Britain, she met her partner with whom she has four children - a four-year-old boy, a two-year-old girl, and twins, born in April this year. Mrs Zhang applied for indefinite leave to remain in Britain under the Home Office's Legacy Scheme, which gives preferential treatment to immigrants who have lived in Britain for long periods. Her application was refused earlier this year. Lawyers for Mrs Zhang argue that she now has a network of friends and an established life in Britain. Since the refusal of her application, Mrs Zhang has been terrified her children could be taken away from her if she is forced to return to China, the hearing was told. China's communist government only allows one-child families in urban areas, with parents in some rural areas permitted to have two children. The court also heard claims the Home Office should have given more consideration to the human rights of the four children when processing the application for leave to remain. Judge Dingemans has now ruled her case 'arguable' and granted her permission to have the Home Office's decision judicially reviewed at the High Court later this year. He said recent judgements have emphasised the importance of considering children's human rights in immigration decisions, adding: 'It seems to me that this case does cross the threshold of arguability, and for that reason I grant permission.'

chatgpt: A Chinese woman who has been living in the United Kingdom for over a decade says she may have to return to China where she fears her child could be taken away due to the country's one-child policy. Xiu Fang Zhang, a mother of a ten-year-old boy, has won the right to appeal a decision by the Home Office to deport her over visa issues. Ms. Zhang arrived in the UK in 2008 on a student visa and has since been living in the country on various visas. In 2013, she gave birth to her son in the UK and has been fighting to remain in the country with him ever since. However, the Home Office rejected her latest visa application in 2019, citing her failure to provide evidence of her financial stability and the genuineness of her relationship with her partner. Ms. Zhang has argued that if she returns to China, her child, who is a British citizen, could be taken away from her due to the country's one-child policy, which restricts the number of children that families can have. She also claims that her family in China will not be able to support her and her child as they are poor farmers. After a long legal battle, Ms. Zhang has won the right to appeal the Home Office's decision to deport her. Speaking to reporters outside the court, she expressed her relief and said she was hopeful that she and her son could stay in the UK. "I'm very happy about the decision today," she said. "I hope that we can now stay in the UK, which has been our home for so many years." Her lawyer, Alex Goodman, said the ruling opened the door for Ms. Zhang to continue fighting her case. "This is a really important result for our client, but also for others in similar situations," he said. "The judge found that we had satisfied the legal test to be able to appeal this decision and that we had demonstrated that there were legitimate and compassionate reasons for Ms. Zhang to stay in the UK." Ms. Zhang's case has highlighted the challenges faced by parents who are caught up in the UK visa system. Many families are separated or forced to leave the country due to visa restrictions, while others are trapped in a cycle of applying for repeated visas without any guarantee of success. Immigration rights campaigners have called for a more compassionate approach to the UK visa system, arguing that many families are being unfairly penalized for circumstances beyond their control. Ms. Zhang's case also shines a light on the one-child policy in China, which has been in place since the late 1970s. While the policy has been relaxed in recent years, families are still subject to penalties and fines if they have more than one child. Ms. Zhang is now awaiting the date of her appeal hearing and says she is hopeful that she and her son can continue to call the UK their home.
