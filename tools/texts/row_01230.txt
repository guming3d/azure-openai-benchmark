article: Madrid (CNN) -- Pro-independence parties in Catalonia defied the Spanish government Thursday by announcing in Barcelona that they plan to hold a referendum in November on whether the wealthy northeast region should be independent. Madrid staunchly opposes the referendum and Catalan independence, and a Spanish government official rejected the announcement. "The vote will not be held," Justice Minister Alberto Ruiz-Gallardon told reporters Thursday in the hallways of Spain's parliament. Even supporters admit that there is much to be done before the vote can take place on November 9, 2014. "We expect to open negotiations with Madrid. The Spanish state can't be blind about it," said Joan Maria Pique, a top aide and spokesman for Catalan regional president Artur Mas, who had a prominent role Thursday when his Convergence and Union party announced the plan with three other parties. They had previously said only that the vote would be sometime in late 2014. And they also announced the two-part referendum question: . Do you want Catalonia to become a state? And if the voter answers yes, then comes this: Do you want that state to be independent? That's a different formula from the single question that Scottish voters are due to get on September 18: Should Scotland be an independent country?" Pique said the two-part question in Catalonia was the result of negotiations among the four pro-independence parties, but he noted that Great Britain has agreed to allow the Scottish vote on self-determination, while Spain has not followed suit yet for Catalonia. The Spanish government says that Catalonia, with 7.5 million people, already has broad home-rule powers, including its own parliament, police force and control over education and health. And Madrid insists that the Spanish Constitution does not allow any of Spain's 17 regions to unilaterally break away, even one like Catalonia that has its own flag and language. The four pro-independence Catalan parties hold a majority in the Catalan regional parliament. There have been mass demonstrations in favor of self-determination on the past two Catalan national days on September 11. This year, hundreds of thousands of people formed a human chain -- from northern Catalonia, at the French border, to its southern border with the Valencia region -- to drive home the point. Last year on September 11, an estimated 1.5 million people demonstrated in Barcelona, the regional capital and Spain's second-largest city, for self-determination. Various opinion polls show a very large majority of Catalans want the right of self-determination. But if independence makes it to the ballot, polls show the result could be tighter, with some predicting a victory in the 50% range.

chatgpt: A long-awaited referendum on Catalan independence has been called by pro-independence parties for November 9, 2014. However, the move has been met with resistance from Justice Minister Alberto Ruiz-Gallardon, who emphatically stated, "The vote will not be held." The call for a referendum comes after years of mass demonstrations in the region, with many demanding greater self-determination. Catalonia, with its own distinct culture and language, has long been a hotbed of separatist sentiment, with calls for independence growing ever-louder in recent years. However, the central government in Madrid has been adamant that the nation's constitution does not allow regions to unilaterally break away. This position has put the government at odds with many Catalans, who feel that their right to self-determination is being stifled. Despite the government's opposition, the pro-independence parties in Catalonia have vowed to press ahead with the referendum. The vote will ask Catalans whether they want their region to become an independent state within the European Union. The situation has sparked a heated debate, with both sides accusing the other of undermining democracy. Pro-independence groups argue that the government is denying the people of Catalonia their right to vote, while Madrid insists that the referendum is illegal and goes against the constitution. The Catalan government has been working tirelessly to build support for the referendum, with many seeing it as a defining moment in the region's history. However, the central government has made it clear that any attempts to hold the vote will be met with legal action. In the run-up to the referendum, tensions have continued to rise, with both sides digging in their heels. Protests have been held in support of Catalonia's right to self-determination, while Madrid has sought to counter the separatist movement with its own rallies. The situation is complex, with no easy solution in sight. Many Catalans feel that they have been neglected and marginalized by the central government, and that independence is the only way to secure their future. However, Madrid is equally determined to maintain the integrity of the Spanish state, and will not allow Catalonia to break away without a fight. The coming weeks will be pivotal in determining the future of Catalonia, and the wider implications for Spain as a whole. Whatever the outcome of the referendum, it is clear that the issue of Catalan independence will remain a divisive and contentious topic for years to come.
