article: The Vintage Sports-Car Club love their vehicles so much they couldn't bear to keep their old beauties cooped up in a garage. And far from taking their stunning pre-World War Two gems out for a gentle chug-along, they test them to the limits on the gravel of one of Britain's steepest roads. One hundred vintage vehicle enthusiasts gather each November for their Lakeland Trial in the Lakes District to test their motors on the 2,126ft Fleetwith Pike, with the latest event taking place on November 8. An 1928 Austin 7 Chummy (left) gets ready to set off on the gravel slope of 2,126ft Fleetwith Pike . This 1930 Austin 7 Gordon England Cup struggles up the top section during the Lakeland Trial . One of seven annual trials - untimed climbing contests - for the club, the pinnacle of this event is the stage in which they take on the ‘Drumhouse’ section at Honister Slate Mine, as seen in this video with footage from 2011 and 2013. Austin 7s are the most common entrants in the trial, considered relatively cheap for the category and easier to maintain than more complex models. Other makes still famous today, some more than others, include Riley, Bentley, Frazer Nash, Ford, Vauxhall, Bugatti and MG . This video features a fantastic red 1921 Fiat 501S Biposto, a 1924 Vauxhall 30-98 OE Velox, a 1933 Frazer Nash Colmore and a 1925 Bentley 3/4½ Litre. The Austin 7 is the most popular car for the trials, held around Britain by the Vintage Sports-Car Club . While there are typically a dozen sections in a trial, this 'Drumhouse' section is easily to most anticipated . Each car has at least one passenger, who is known as a bouncer - they literally bounce up and down in the car to assist with the climb. A successful ascent is considered a mighty achievement for some of the less agile machines. The Lakeland Trial has taken place every year since 1968 with cars ranging from 1918 to 1939 models (official known as vintage) up to the Post Vintage Thoroughbred category for cars from 1931 to 1941. The oldest vehicle in recent years was a 1903. From Bentley to Rolls Royce, Aston Martin to Bugatti, the classic cars trundled across rocky passes against a backdrop of spectacular scenery in the Lake District. The club's website describes the quirky event as the 'ultimate test of our Pre-war machinery'.
