article: Lost and Found at Amsterdam airport just got a whole lot cuter, with the introduction of an investigative beagle. Airline KLM has employed a cute, uniform-wearing dog to help reunite passengers with lost items that they leave behind on planes. The pooch - appropriately named Sherlock - uses its tracking skills to smell the lost item then dash through Amsterdam Schipol Airport to find the appropriate owner. The energetic beagle can be seen bounding through the airport with mobiles and headphones tucked in his pouch and even carrying stuffed toys back to their rightful owners. A video released by the airline shows how Sherlock is doted on by staff. Sandra List, a member of KLM's Team Lost & Found said: 'I think he is a real asset to the company . Puppy power! Sherlock the beagle comes to the rescue to return a missing phone . Leaps and bounds: The unusual lost and found system has delighted passengers at Amsterdam Schipol . 'Our main goal is to return lost items to owners as fast as possible. I really love that we're getting some help with that.' But rescuing abandoned items from planes is a tough job and Sherlock certainly needed some training. His handler Dirk van Driel, explained: 'We train for muscle strength endurance and of course socialisation. On the trail: The dog sniffs the item then dashes through the airport to find its owner . Reunited: One man shows his delight as his expensive headphones are returned to him . Star of the show: Sherlock happily poses for pictures with grateful passengers . 'When you see the reactions of the passengers that really is amazing.' Sherlock has become something of a star at the airport, with grateful customers posing for selfies with him and staff showing him with attention. One woman who works on KLM's check-in desk said: 'He drops by regularly but I have to admit I do spoil him a bit.'

chatgpt: Sherlock, a five-year-old beagle, has been working with KLM Airlines' lost and found team at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport for over two years now. The furry detective is not your average employee, however. Sherlock's unique ability to sniff out lost items and reunite them with their owners has made him quite the popular pup around the terminal. Equipped with a special pouch in his jacket, Sherlock spends his days hunting for valuables left behind on planes or in airport lounges. From passports to jewelry to laptops, there's no limit to what the dog detective can find. And once he's got a scent, he won't give up until he's found the item and, more importantly, its owner. KLM's lost and found team initially reached out to Wagtail UK, a company that specializes in training dogs for scent detection, when they were seeking a solution for the many lost and found items that pass through the airport. After some intensive training, Sherlock was ready to join the team and get to work. According to KLM, Sherlock has an incredible knack for finding items that other search methods might miss. In one instance, a passenger left a valuable ring on a plane and didn't even realize it until they'd landed at their destination. But thanks to Sherlock's keen sense of smell, the ring was discovered and returned to its rightful owner. Sherlock's work hasn't gone unnoticed, either. The beagle has gained quite the following on social media, with passengers sharing stories and photos of their interactions with the furry detective. Even celebrities like Arnold Schwarzenegger have taken notice, posing for photos with Sherlock during a recent visit to Amsterdam. While Sherlock may be a non-traditional member of the lost and found team, his work has undoubtedly made a difference for countless travelers passing through Schiphol Airport. And with his impressive track record of reuniting passengers with their belongings, it's safe to say that Sherlock will be on the job for quite some time to come.
