article: Survivor: Ruby Graupera-Cassimiro, 40, lived through a usually-fatal birth complication when her daughter was delivered by cesarean . A new mother whose heart stopped beating after a rare complication while giving birth miraculously survived 45 minutes with no pulse. Ruby Graupera-Cassimiro, 40, was saved by 'divine providence' after her cesarean section went badly wrong. Amniotic fluid from her womb got into her bloodstream and had stopped her heart beating - which is usually fatal. Doctors at the Boca Raton Regional Hospital in Florida, were just about to pronounce Graupera-Cassimiro dead when her heart restarted for no obvious reason. The complication came just after she gave birth to a healthy daughter, Taily, who is now two and a half weeks old. Grauper-Cassimiro passed out for three hours while medics battle to bring her back. They assumed they had failed, and called her family into the operation room to declare her death officially. Her family had already been told there was nothing more that could be done. But the mother of two, who works in human resources, defied expectations in the September 23 ordeal, and, even more stunningly, suffered no brain damage other other ill-effects. She is now at home and caring for her child. This week she returned to the hospital to thank the medics who helped save her. At the reunion, she said: 'I don't know why I was given this opportunity - but I'm very grateful for it. 'God had the right people in the right place', she told the Sun Sentinel.

Grauper-Cassimiro was awake and talking to her family after her 'unremarkable' cesarean when she suddenly passed out. Medical workers used shock paddles and chest compressions throughout the emergency to try to restore heart beat and circulation while she was unconscious. Despite a three-hour fight to save her, when Grauper-Cassimiro's pulse gave out, doctors thought she would surely die, and had told her distraught family as much when she pulled through. A hospital spokesman said: 'She essentially spontaneously resuscitated when we were about to call the time of death.' 'Today she is the picture of health.' Doctors had no immediate explanation for her survival. The spokesman called her survival 'divine providence.'

chatgpt: In a remarkable turn of events, a new mother in Florida has defied the odds and survived a medical emergency that is usually fatal. Ruby Craupera-Cassimiro, 40, gave birth to her daughter Taily via cesarean section, but complications arose when amniotic fluid leaked into her bloodstream. Craupera-Cassimiro fell unconscious while speaking with family members after the birth. Medical professionals quickly realized the gravity of the situation and feared for the worst. The condition caused her heart to stop beating. According to medics at Boca Raton Regional Hospital, Florida, the prognosis was grim, and they had told the family that she would not survive. However, moments before they pronounced her death, her pulse miraculously returned. The medical staff at the hospital were left in awe of what they call "divine providence." Indeed, it is rare for patients to survive amniotic fluid embolism, which is typically fatal under most circumstances. The timely return of her pulse has given her a chance at life. According to medical professionals, amniotic fluid embolism occurs when amniotic fluid leaks into the mother's bloodstream, which can cause inflammation, spasms, and ultimately stop the heart. Patients can die within minutes if not treated promptly. In Craupera-Cassimiro's case, it appears that the quick action of medical staff and perhaps some divine intervention may have played a role in her survival. The Craupera-Cassimiro family has expressed their gratitude to the medical staff and are relieved that Ruby survived the ordeal. Her daughter Taily is healthy and remains under the care of medical professionals. Ruby, on the other hand, is still recovering, and doctors are closely monitoring her condition. The miraculous recovery of Ruby demonstrates the resilience of the human body and spirit. Her survival is a testament to the power of modern medicine and the strength of the human will. The medical staff at Boca Raton Regional Hospital are delighted to see their efforts rewarded, and they hope her recovery will provide a source of hope and inspiration for others. In conclusion, Ruby Craupera-Cassimiro's story is a testament to the enduring strength of the human spirit. Facing a seemingly insurmountable medical condition, she managed to pull through, and her survival has given her a renewed sense of purpose. As she continues her recovery, she will undoubtedly be a source of inspiration to those around her. Her survival serves as a reminder that with the right treatment, anything is possible, and miracles do happen.
