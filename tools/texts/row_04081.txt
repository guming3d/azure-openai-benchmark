article: (CNN) -- The family of Jules Bianchi, the Formula One racing driver who was critically injured at Sunday's Japanese Grand Prix, have revealed that he is suffering from a "diffuse axonal injury." It is a potentially devastating type of brain injury which causes widespread tearing of nerve fibers across the whole of the brain, according to the UK brain injury charity, Headway. The 25-year-old Marussia driver remains in a critical but stable state, his family said in a statement released via the F1 team's official Facebook page. "Jules remains in the Intensive Care Unit of the Mie General Medical Center in Yokkaichi. He has suffered a diffuse axonal injury and is in a critical but stable condition," the statement said. "The medical professionals at the hospital are providing the very best treatment and care and we are grateful for everything they have done for Jules since his accident." The Frenchman sustained his injuries after coming off the track and colliding with a recovery vehicle that was removing Adrian Sutil's Sauber car -- the German driver had skidded off the track at turn seven moments earlier in a rain-affected race. "This is a very difficult time for our family, but the messages of support and affection for Jules from all over the world have been a source of great comfort to us. We would like to express our sincere appreciation," the statement said. "We are also grateful for the presence of Professor Gerard Saillant, President of the FIA Medical Commission, and Professor Alessandro Frati, Neurosurgeon of the University of Rome La Sapienza, who has travelled to Japan at the request of Scuderia Ferrari. "They arrived at the hospital today and met with the medical personnel responsible for Jules' treatment, in order to be fully informed of his clinical status so that they are able to advise the family. "The hospital will continue to monitor and treat Jules and further medical updates will be provided when appropriate." Read more: Marussia request patience on Bianchi condition .

chatgpt: Jules Bianchi, a French Formula One driver, was involved in a horrific accident at Sunday's Japanese Grand Prix. The accident occurred when Bianchi collided with a recovery vehicle that was attempting to remove a competitor's car at the side of the track. The accident caused Bianchi to suffer from a "diffuse axonal injury," according to a statement released by his family. A diffuse axonal injury is a serious brain injury that causes widespread tearing of nerve fibers in the brain. It can occur as a result of a severe rotational or shearing force, such as that experienced in a car accident. The injury is often associated with a poor prognosis and can result in long-term disability or even death. Following the accident, Bianchi was taken to a hospital in Yokkaichi, Japan, where he underwent emergency surgery. He was later airlifted to a hospital in France, where he remains in intensive care. The news of Bianchi's injury has shaken the Formula One community, with many expressing their support for the driver and his family. In a statement, the UK brain injury charity Headway said, "Diffuse axonal injuries are among the most serious types of brain injury and can have life-changing consequences for the individual and their loved ones." The accident has also raised questions about the safety of the sport. In recent years, there have been a number of high-profile accidents in Formula One, including the death of driver Jules Bianchi in 2015. As a result, the sport's governing body has introduced a number of safety measures, including the use of virtual safety cars and the introduction of more crash barriers. In a statement, the FIA, the governing body of Formula One, said it was "working closely with the race organizers and the teams to investigate the incident and ensure all necessary support is being provided to Jules and his family." Bianchi's family has thanked fans and well-wishers for their support and asked for privacy at this difficult time. "Our thoughts are with Jules and his family," said a statement from the FIA. "We are praying for him."
