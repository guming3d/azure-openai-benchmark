Talented artists were today putting the finishing touches to a series of music-themed sand sculptures ahead of a major exhibition that will last throughout the summer. The international Sand Sculpture Festival starts on Monday and has turned the Black Rock site in Brighton into a sand village of the world's biggest music stars. Around 4,000 tonnes of sand had to be shipped in to Brighton for the 20 artists to work with because the city's own beach is pebbly.
