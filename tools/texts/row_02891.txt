chatgpt: Peter Greste's family caused a stir on social media when they tweeted on Monday that "the Presidential Decree has been invoked." Many of Greste's followers speculated about the meaning of the tweet, with some even suggesting that it was an indication that Greste would be deported from Egypt. However, the family later clarified that they had misunderstood the situation and the tweet referred to a new law that allows the Egyptian President to deport foreigners convicted or accused of crimes. The tweet came just days after a Cairo court ordered a retrial for Greste and two of his colleagues from the Al-Jazeera news network. The three journalists were convicted on charges of spreading false news and aiding the now-banned Muslim Brotherhood. However, the retrial offers hope that the three men may be released from prison and allowed to return home. Greste's family later issued a statement apologizing for the confusion caused by their initial tweet. They explained that they had misinterpreted the situation and that "the paperwork has been submitted and we are hopeful for a positive outcome." The new law referenced in the family's tweet was passed by the Egyptian government earlier this year. The law allows the President to deport foreigners who are accused or convicted of crimes, without the need for a court order. The law has been criticized by human rights groups, who argue that it could be used to target political opponents and journalists, such as Greste. Greste was first arrested in December 2013, along with his colleagues Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed. They were accused of aiding the Muslim Brotherhood, which had been designated as a terrorist organization by the Egyptian government. Their trial was widely criticized by human rights groups, who argued that the charges were politically-motivated and that the evidence against the three journalists was weak. After spending more than a year in prison, Greste was released in February 2015 and deported from Egypt. However, Fahmy and Mohamed remained in prison and were later released on bail. The retrial ordered by the Cairo court last week is seen as a significant development in the case. It offers hope that the three Al-Jazeera journalists may finally be exonerated and allowed to return home. However, it is still unclear when the retrial will take place and what the outcome will be. The case of Peter Greste and his colleagues has drawn international attention and criticism. Human rights groups and journalists' organizations have called for their release and have condemned the Egyptian government's crackdown on free speech and press freedom. The retrial ordered by the Cairo court is seen as an opportunity for the Egyptian government to demonstrate a commitment to human rights and justice.
