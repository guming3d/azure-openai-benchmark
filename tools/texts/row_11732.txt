chatgpt: Queens Park Rangers striker, Loic Remy, has signed for Premier League rivals Chelsea following his failed medical at Anfield. Remy was due to join Liverpool for £8million before his medical test results showed that he was not fit enough to play for the club. Remy admitted that he did not understand Liverpool's decision and felt that it was not very honest from their side. The French striker was expected to fill in the void left by Luis Suarez, who joined Barcelona earlier this summer. Liverpool was keen on signing Remy, who had an impressive season on loan at Newcastle last year scoring 14 goals in 26 appearances. The Reds saw Remy as a perfect replacement for Suarez and were keen to finalize the deal. However, things took a wrong turn when the player failed his medical tests. Remy's statement about Liverpool's decision has caused a stir in the football community. Many fans and experts feel that Liverpool acted unprofessionally by not being transparent with the player about their decision. Remy's comments have also raised concerns about the club's medical team, who failed to spot the player's alleged fitness concerns. Meanwhile, Chelsea has snapped up the French striker and has added a new dimension to their attack. With Diego Costa already on the team, Remy will be able to lead the Chelsea attack when needed. Remy's versatility and goal-scoring abilities will make him a valuable asset to the team. Overall, Remy's failed medical at Liverpool has caused a lot of controversy, and his comments about the club's decision have created a rift between him and the supporters. However, his move to Chelsea has generated excitement among fans who are eager to see him play for the London club.
