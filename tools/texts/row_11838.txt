article: Atlanta, Georgia (CNN)  -- A third beluga whale belonging to the world's largest aquarium has died, the Georgia Aquarium announced late Monday. The exact cause of Nico's sudden death on Saturday is inconclusive from the initial necropsy or animal autopsy. The Georgia Aquarium hopes to find out more information in the months ahead from a more detailed necropsy. "As we work with and care for the many animals at the Georgia Aquarium, we become attached emotionally," said Dr. Gregory D. Bossart, chief veterinary officer at the aquarium. "The loss is not unlike that of faithful dog or special horse that has been a part your life for years." Nico died at Sea World in San Antonio, where he and two other beluga whales had been moved temporarily while the Georgia Aquarium is undergoing renovation. Nico was scheduled to return home to Atlanta next month with companions Maris and Natasha. Nico arrived in Atlanta with Gaspar, two whales obtained from a park in Mexico. Both animals suffered "significant health issues" from their times in a foreign park and were essentially "living on borrowed time," said Bossart, who had been caring for the two whales as far as nine years ago, while they were still in Mexico. "We rescued Nico knowing that he had health issues due to his prior home, but we were confident that we could provide a better quality of life for his final years," Bossart said. Gaspar was suffering from a bone disease contracted before arriving at the downtown Atlanta aquarium and was euthanized in January 2007. Another beluga whale, Marina, died 11 months later from complications of old age. Beluga whales or white whales, whose name is derived from a Russian word meaning white, typically live in Arctic and sub-Arctic regions including Canada, Russia, Greenland and the U.S. state of Alaska. They can live up to 35 years. The belugas are not the only high-profile deaths at the Georgia Aquarium, which opened in late 2005. A pair of whale sharks have also died at the eight-million-gallon facility, the only one outside Asia to display the giant fish. CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Nico, the beloved bottlenose dolphin, passed away suddenly on Saturday at Sea World in San Antonio, Texas. According to a statement released by the marine park, Nico was under temporary care at Sea World while the Georgia Aquarium underwent renovations. The announcement of his death has left experts and animal-lovers alike seeking answers. In an effort to find out what caused the sudden demise of this marine mammal, an autopsy has been performed. However, the results of the autopsy have left more questions unanswered than answered. The cause of death for Nico remains inconclusive. Nico was a popular resident of the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, Georgia. It was in this facility that he was born and subsequently lived for 13 years. His transfer to Sea World was intended to be a temporary measure, allowing for essential renovations to take place at his former home. The Georgia Aquarium has issued a statement expressing their sorrow at the loss of Nico, who they describe as "one of the most beloved members of our dolphin family." The statement outlines that the aquarium is currently working with Sea World and several marine-mammal experts to investigate the cause of Nico's death. Animal rights groups have decried the treatment of captive marine animals, citing that captivity is not suitable for these intelligent creatures. According to National Geographic, dolphins are known to live for up to 50 years in their natural habitat, while the average lifespan of a captive dolphin is only 5 years. Despite the calls for an end to the captivity of these animals, marine parks and aquariums continue to keep them for entertainment purposes. This leads to the high-stress environment that captive dolphins often face, resulting in health problems and, in some cases, premature death. The death of Nico has sparked a conversation around the treatment of marine animals in captivity. For animal-lovers and activists, it is yet another example of why these creatures should be allowed to live in their natural habitats, free from the constraints of captivity. In conclusion, the sudden death of Nico has left many unanswered questions. While the results of the autopsy were inconclusive, his death has generated more interest in the treatment of marine animals in captivity. Captivity is, for many, not a suitable environment for these intelligent creatures, and the debate around this continues as we mourn the loss of one of the most beloved dolphins in the country.
