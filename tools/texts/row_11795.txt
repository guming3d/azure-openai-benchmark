article: The 'alcopop generation' are paying the price for growing up with widely available access to alcohol . The ‘alcopop generation’ is dying needlessly from liver disease fuelled by alcohol and obesity, a report warns. Experts say young Britons are paying the price of growing up with cheap drink available round the clock. A report by Public Health England today calls for tackling liver disease to be made a national priority because ‘young lives are being needlessly lost’. There are nearly 11,000 deaths from liver disease a year in England, including victims in their 20s. This rate has increased by 40 per cent in a little over a decade even though it is falling everywhere else in Europe. The report warns that in some areas of the country the death rate for men is four times higher than others due to differing levels of alcohol and obesity. Blackpool and Manchester have the highest rates at 58.4 per 100,000 people and 54.9 per 100,000 respectively. At the other end of the scale Central Bedfordshire has just 13 per 100,000 and Hertfordshire has 13.6 per 100,000. Professor Julia Verne, Lead for Liver Disease at Public Health England, said: ‘Liver disease is a public health priority because young lives are being needlessly lost. ‘Liver disease is needlessly killing young people, people of working age. ‘We must do more to raise awareness, nationally and locally, and this is why it is so important for the public and health professionals to understand their local picture.’ Scroll down for video . Emily Robinson, Deputy Chief Executive of Alcohol Concern said: ‘The country is in danger of losing the battle against liver disease, which goes against the trend in much of the rest of Europe where many of our neighbours are actually making progress. ‘It’s a tragedy that we’re actually seeing cases of young people in their twenties dying of alcoholic liver disease, when this can be prevented. ‘The so called ‘alcopops generation’ have grown up in a society where alcohol is available at almost anytime, anywhere, at incredibly cheap prices and promoted nonstop.’ A report found there are nearly 11,000 deaths from liver disease a year in England, including victims in their 20s . The report shows that areas with the highest death rate have the most pubs for their population. In Blackpool there is one pub to 72 people compared to one pub for 281 people in Hertfordshire. Figures show that the number of people who died from liver disease in England rose from 7,841 in 2001 to 10,948 in 2012. Andrew Langford, Chief Executive of The British Liver Trust, said: ‘These profiles, which were urgently needed, will begin to address the devastating rise of poor liver health throughout the country and reduce unnecessary deaths of increasingly younger people from liver disease.’

chatgpt: Young people in the UK are paying the price for growing up in a society where cheap alcohol is widely available, with figures showing nearly 11,000 deaths from liver disease every year. In some areas of the country, the death rate for men is four times higher than the national average. According to a report by Public Health England, tackling liver disease should be a national priority, as it warns that "young lives are needlessly being lost" with victims even in their 20s. The report highlights the devastating impact of alcohol on the liver, with excessive drinking leading to a range of illnesses including cirrhosis and liver cancer. It also warns that liver disease is often a silent killer, with many people not recognising the symptoms until it's too late. Experts are calling for urgent action to address the issue, including measures to encourage responsible drinking and increase awareness of the dangers of excessive alcohol consumption. Some areas of the country have already taken steps to tackle liver disease, with Liverpool leading the way in terms of prevention and treatment. The city has implemented a range of initiatives, including a programme to screen people for early signs of liver damage and targeted support for those who have been diagnosed with the condition. Other areas of the country are also taking action, with a number of local authorities introducing minimum unit pricing for alcohol and investing in alcohol treatment and support services. However, there are concerns that not enough is being done to address the issue nationally. The report calls for a coordinated approach to tackling liver disease, with a focus on prevention and early diagnosis. Commenting on the report, Dr. John Middleton, President of the Faculty of Public Health, said: "We have known for a long time that alcohol is a major cause of liver disease, yet we continue to see young lives needlessly lost as a result. It's time for action to be taken at a national level to address this issue and ensure that young people are not paying the price for our failure to address the harm caused by alcohol." The report also highlights the need for better data on liver disease, citing a lack of information about the prevalence of the condition and the effectiveness of different treatment options. Overall, the report serves as a stark reminder of the devastating impact of alcohol on the liver and the urgent need for action to address this critical public health issue. With young lives needlessly being lost, it's time for the UK to take a more strategic and coordinated approach to tackling liver disease, with a focus on prevention, early diagnosis, and effective treatment and support services.
