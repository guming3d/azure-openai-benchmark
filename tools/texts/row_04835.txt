The woman, 23, and the young man, 25 - who have not yet been identified - were both fatally wounded, while the older man, believed to be the man's grandfather, is still fighting for his life in critical condition. According to police reports, the victims were shot outside the family's home.

Authorities are currently searching for a 2006 silver Pontiac G6, believed to be the getaway vehicle used by the suspect. With little information available at this time, authorities are asking the public for any information that could lead to an arrest. Neighbors are understandably shaken by the news, with many expressing disbelief that such a violent crime could occur in their quiet community. "It's a tragedy. It's just awful," said one long-time resident who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "I can't believe someone could do something like this, especially outside of a family's home. It's just awful." Police have not yet identified a motive for the attack, but are investigating all leads. Detectives are currently canvassing the neighborhood for any additional information and are reviewing security footage from nearby homes. The tragedy has left the community reeling, with many expressing shock and sadness at the loss of two young lives.
