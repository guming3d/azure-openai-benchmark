article: The Justice Department is collecting data from thousands of cellphones through high-tech gear deployed on airplanes that mimics communications towers, . The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that the hunt for information about criminal suspects is also collecting data from many innocent Americans. Citing sources familiar with the operations, the newspaper said the U.S. Marshal's Service program, which became fully operational in 2007, operates Cessna aircraft from at least five metropolitan-area airports, selected as they cover most of the American population, to collect the data. Operation: According to sources, the U.S. Marshal's Service program operates Cessna aircraft from at least five metropolitan-area airports, selected as they cover most of the American population, to collect the data . The airports were not identified in the Journal story. The planes are equipped with devices called 'dirtboxes,' that mimic cell towers of large telecommunications firms and trick cellphones into reporting unique registration information. The two-foot-square devices allow investigators to collect data from thousands of cellphones in a single flight, the Journal reported. The devices collect their identifying information and general location. The Justice Department would neither confirm nor deny the existence of such a program to the Journal. An official told the newspaper that discussion of such matters would allow criminal suspects of foreign powers to determine U.S. surveillance capabilities, adding that Justice Department agencies comply with federal law, including by seeking court approval. Calling it 'a dragnet surveillance program,' Christopher Soghoian, chief technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union, said: 'It's inexcusable and it's likely — to the extent judges are authorizing it — they have no idea of the scale of it.' No comment: The Justice Department would neither confirm nor deny the existence of such a program . The device being used by the Marshals Service identifies itself as having the closest, strongest signal — though it doesn't — and causes all the cellphones that can detect its signal to send in their unique registration information. Cellphones are programmed to connect automatically to the strongest cell tower signal. Phone companies are cut out in the search for suspects. Law enforcement has found that asking a company for cell-tower information to help locate a suspect can be slow and inaccurate. This program allows the government to get that information itself. People familiar with the program told the Journal they do get court orders to search for phones, but it isn't clear whether those orders describe the methods used because the orders are sealed.

chatgpt: In 2007, the U.S Marshal Service rolled out a program to collect data from individuals across the United States. The program, which operates using Cessna aircrafts based in five major airports, is intended to cover the majority of the American population. The data collection is carried out using devices known as "dirtboxes," which are used to trick cellphones into reporting their unique registration information. The Marshal Service has been using this program for several years, and the use of "dirtboxes" has been a contentious issue since their initial deployment. Critics have raised concerns that the devices infringe on the privacy rights of individuals whose data is collected, as well as their First Amendment rights to free speech. Despite these concerns, the Marshal Service has continued to use the "dirtboxes" in their data collection efforts. The devices are equipped with technology that allows them to scan for and collect unique registration information from cellphones within a given area. This information can then be used to identify and track individuals, which is one of the primary objectives of the program. The program has been successful in collecting large amounts of data from individuals across the country. However, the use of "dirtboxes" has drawn criticism from many quarters. Privacy advocates have been particularly vocal in their opposition to the program, pointing out that the collection of such data without a warrant or court order violates the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Despite these concerns, the Marshal Service has continued to operate the program. The agency believes that the data collected is necessary for their work in tracking down fugitives and locating individuals who may pose a threat to public safety. The use of "dirtboxes" has also raised concerns about the potential for abuse by law enforcement agencies. Critics argue that the devices could be used to track the movements of individuals who are not suspected of any crime, effectively turning the program into a mass surveillance effort. The Marshal Service has defended the use of "dirtboxes," arguing that the devices are necessary to track down fugitives and locate individuals who may pose a threat to public safety. The agency has also pointed out that the data collected is subject to strict protocols for handling and storage, with measures in place to prevent abuse or misuse. Overall, the U.S Marshal Service's data collection program using "dirtboxes" has been controversial from its inception. While the program has been effective in gathering intelligence, concerns about privacy and potential abuse by law enforcement agencies continue to be raised. It remains to be seen whether these concerns will result in changes to the program, or if the Marshal Service will be allowed to continue utilizing these devices in their ongoing efforts to ensure public safety.
