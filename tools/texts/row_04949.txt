article: (CNN) -- A Tuesday hearing was canceled in a battle between the New England Patriots and accused killer Aaron Hernandez over the former tight end's demand for his team records, including medical and psychological tests as well as his scouting report. Defense attorney Michael Fee told the court "the matter is resolved," without elaborating. Efforts to reach both Hernandez' attorneys were unsuccessful, and a Patriots' spokesman declined to comment. The defense had rejected an offer to receive what the Patriots called most of his records. The three-time Super Bowl champion team had flatly refused to turn over a scouting report citing "trade secrets" and said the team only had a summary of the psychological report done at the 2010 NFL Combine. The Patriots told the defense to go the people who administer the test for full results. A source close to the investigation told CNN that the defense likely will get what it wanted. Prosecutors said it is a defense matter and gave no further comment. The Patriots cut Hernandez on June 26, 2013, the same day he was arrested in the slaying of Odin Lloyd, who once dated a sister of Hernandez's fiancee. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to murder in that case and in another to the slayings of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado in 2012. Legal experts said the defense's attempt to look at Hernandez's team records may indicate an interest in pursuing a diminished capacity defense. Earlier this month, Fee argued the tests would be relevant to their case. "Any record bearing on a defendant's psychological function, illnesses or afflictions, addiction, cognitive ability, social interactions, behavior under stress, relationship with authority and other such factors are undeniably relevant to the defense of an individual charged with first degree murder," Fee wrote in a motion to a Massachusetts superior court judge. A tentative trial date has been set for January 9 in the Lloyd case. A judge set September 30 as the deadline when defense must advise court if it intends to ask for a change of venue.

chatgpt: A request for psychological and medical test results for former NFL player Aaron Hernandez has been settled without comment from Hernandez's legal team. During the hearing, Hernandez's defense attorney stated that the issue had been settled and declined to comment further. Hernandez is currently facing two separate murder trials, both of which he has pleaded not guilty to. The request for test results was made by Hernandez's defense team in relation to one of the trials. The former New England Patriots tight end is charged with the July 2012 murders of Safiro Furtado and Daniel de Abreu, who were shot while sitting in a car at a stoplight in Boston's South End. Hernandez has also been charged with the murder of Odin Lloyd, a semi-professional football player who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fianc√©e. According to court documents, Hernandez's defense team had requested access to psychological and medical test results related to Lloyd's death. The results were reportedly obtained by the prosecution during the investigation of Lloyd's murder. The request for test results was not the only recent development in Hernandez's case. Earlier this month, Hernandez's attorneys filed a motion to dismiss the charges related to the murders of Furtado and de Abreu. The motion argues that the prosecution's case is circumstantial and lacks sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Hernandez was involved in the murders. Hernandez's first murder trial for the killing of Lloyd ended in April 2015 with a conviction and a sentence of life in prison without parole. If convicted in the trials related to the murders of Furtado and de Abreu, Hernandez could face an additional life sentence. Despite the serious nature of the charges, Hernandez has maintained his innocence throughout both trials. His defense team has argued that Hernandez's association with individuals involved in criminal activity does not indicate that he was involved in any crimes. As the trials proceed, it is likely that more developments will arise in Hernandez's case. However, for now, the defense's request for test results has been settled, and Hernandez's legal team is remaining tight-lipped regarding the outcome.
