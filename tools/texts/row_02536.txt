People who write negative reviews on websites are often a retailer's most valuable and loyal customers, American research suggests. Retail specialists at MIT and Northwestern University found the harshest of critics may not have brought the product they were complaining about, but had strong feelings about a service or brand. The study, which is the first to take an in-depth look at the behaviour of customers who write negative reviews online, has disproved popular theories that peeved competitors or oddball customers make the harshest critics. Professor Eric Anderson of Northwestern University and Professor Duncan Simester of MIT, examined over 325,000 online reviews written by customers of a large clothing company and examined more than 7,219 book reviews on Amazon.com to produce their study,Â ABC News reported. They used data collected by the websites that made it possible to match reviews to purchases made. The experts concluded that a firm's most loyal customers are also their most negative reviewers, or to quote a French maxim, 'your best friends are also your harshest critics.' Professor Anderson said that no-one had previously looked at the behaviour of individual reviewers before and when they told the clothing company they were receiving negative reviews from their best customers, they were shocked. They also revealed that the harshest critics had not bought the product they were complaining about and around five per cent of product reviews were written by people who had not bought the item they disliked so much. The researchers found that these reviews . were also on average much more negative than the 95 per cent of genuine . reviews by customers who had purchased a product. After much hypothesising, the marketing . experts concluded that reviewers were acting like 'self-appointed brand . managers' who like the company and continue buying from it despite . penning a venomous review. Retail specialists at MIT and Northwestern University found the harshest of critics had often not brought the product they were complaining about but had strong feelings about a service or brand and were trying something new . They found that critics were often complaining about a new product that is slightly different from a company's core offering and want to tell a company if they suspect it is making a bad decision. Professor Simester believes that customers feel the need to lie about buying a product to review it as they are looking for credibility. He told ABC News that many people underestimate the importance of their reviews, which can have a harmful effect on a company's sales. He thinks the findings of the research might prompt companies to insist that reviewers have bought a specific product first before giving their opinion on it.

chatgpt: A new study conducted in the United States has shed light on the behaviour of customers who write bad reviews. The study, which is the first of its kind, reveals that the harshest critics may not have even purchased the product they were complaining about. Rather, they simply had strong feelings about a particular service or brand. According to the researchers, the findings disprove the prevailing theory that the harshest critics are either peeved competitors or oddball customers. In fact, the study shows that those who write the most scathing reviews are often passionate consumers who feel strongly about particular issues or brands. The research was conducted by a team at the University of California, Berkeley, who analyzed data from thousands of online reviews. They found that the most negative reviews were typically written by people who were not particularly engaged with a product or service, but who had a strong emotional reaction to it. The study also revealed that these passionate consumers were often more likely to share their opinions with others, whether through social media channels or in person. This can have a significant impact on a company's reputation, particularly given the widespread use of online reviews to inform purchasing decisions. The researchers believe that their findings could have important implications for businesses looking to manage their reputation online. They suggest that companies should engage with their customers to understand their opinions and address any concerns they may have. This could help to build a more positive relationship with customers and reduce the likelihood of negative reviews. One of the challenges for companies in this regard is identifying which reviews are genuine and which are not. The researchers say that it can be difficult to determine the motivations of reviewers, particularly given the prevalence of fake reviews and paid endorsements. Despite these challenges, the study provides valuable insights into the behaviour of customers who write bad reviews. It highlights the importance of understanding the emotional reactions that customers have to products and services, and the impact that their opinions can have on a company's reputation. In conclusion, the study conducted by the University of California, Berkeley, provides a unique perspective on the behaviour of customers who write bad reviews. It challenges the prevailing theory about who the harshest critics are and demonstrates the importance of understanding the emotional reactions of consumers. For businesses looking to manage their reputation online, the study provides valuable insights into how to engage with customers and address their concerns.
