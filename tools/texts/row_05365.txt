Sales of skincare products for men have risen by 20 per cent in the past five years, with particularly strong sales of prestige products . Many men may be making sacrifices amid the continuing economic gloom but looking good isn’t one of them. Sales of facial skincare products for men have risen by 20 per cent in the past five years, with particularly strong sales of prestige products. A study by market researchers Mintel found that total sales of men’s grooming products was now £58million, up 3.6 per cent on the year. Moisturiser was used by 42 per cent of men, while facial cleanser was used by almost a quarter (22 per cent). As many as 23 per cent of all men use lip balm, while 16 per cent use facial wipes. Eye cream and gels are used by seven per cent of men, while almost the same number use face masks and peels (six per cent). A further eight per cent use anti ageing products. Charlotte Libby, a Mintel analyst, said: ‘Prestige products have benefited from the “Lipstick Effect”, which has seen sales of luxury beauty products remain strong despite the economic downturn, as consumers treat themselves to small items. 'Additionally, increased and improved distribution channels will have no doubt buoyed the prestige sector.' Top of the range products have risen by almost 10 per cent with people treating themselves despite being strapped for cash. Meanwhile, overall, women are more sceptical about facial skincare claims than men. More than half (52 per cent) of women don’t always believe the claims made by facial skincare products compared to 32 per cent of men. A study by market researchers Mintel found that total sales of men's grooming products was now £58million, up 3.6 per cent on the year . Ms Libby said: 'While many of the nation’s men are adopting a regular skincare regime, it remains that a lower proportion of men use facial skincare products than women. 'Additionally, 19 per cent of men agree they only use facial skincare products when their skin visibly needs it. 'Men’s reactive approach to their skincare regime is the biggest challenge facing the industry. 'Encouraging men to adopt a more preventative approach to their skin’s needs could help drive sales in the category.' Soap is the biggest loser from the sales, with the proportion of female users falling from 58 per cent in 2012 to around a third (36 per cent) in 2013.

chatgpt: Market research firm, Mintel, has revealed that sales of grooming products have hit £58 million in the UK. This marks a major growth in the beauty industry, as men are now taking time to care for their skin, becoming more aware of their grooming habits. Mintel's research showed that moisturisers, facial wipes, eye creams, masks and peels were particularly favoured by men, indicating that they are investing more in their skin care routines. Market analysts predict that sales will only increase as more men become interested in personal grooming. The rise of male grooming has become more apparent in recent years, as men move away from preconceptions of only women wearing makeup or worrying about skincare. A recent survey conducted by Mintel found that 70% of men in the UK now use facial skincare products on a regular basis, with 12% of men saying they use such products every day. This shift in behaviour has encouraged brands to create a range of products specifically designed for male skin. This has helped to remove the stigma surrounding male grooming and has allowed men to be more confident in their routines. Mintel's report also highlights that the popularity of Korean skincare products has played a huge role in the growth of the male grooming industry. Korean products following the 'K-beauty' trend have been incorporated into the routines of many people, with their effectiveness being lauded. “The rise in popularity of Korean skincare for men is changing the male grooming market,” said Alex Fisher, Associate Director for Mintel Beauty & Personal Care. “Offering innovative, eye-catching packaging and an emphasis on the benefits of natural ingredients, the influence of K-beauty on UK brands and consumers is clear to see.” The increasing interest in personal grooming among men in the UK may also be linked to societal changes that saw men questioning typical gender roles. More men are now willing to invest in skincare believing that good grooming leads to a more professional and mature appearance. In conclusion, the market research firm, Mintel, has found that male grooming products are having a major moment in the UK beauty industry at a value of over £58 million. It is expected that this trend will continue as more men continue to realise the importance of personal grooming in their daily routines.
