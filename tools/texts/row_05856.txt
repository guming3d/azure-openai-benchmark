article: Americans are quitting their jobs at the fastest rate since before the economic crash. And analysts are overjoyed. The sharp spike in the 'quits rate' means workers feel more optimistic about finding a new job on the market. Other data on Thursday showed the number of new jobless claims rose last week but remained near a 14-year low, and the two readings suggested the U.S. labor market was moving toward full health. Good sign: Analysts say workers were afraid to leave their jobs but the recent spike will force employers to offer competitive wages to retain talent. Around 2.8 million workers left their jobs in September . Two percent of U.S. job-holders, or about 2.8 million workers, left their jobs under their own volition in September, the Labor Department said - a dramatic rise in comparison with recent months and years, as detailed in a graph by Vox. It means employers, who have not had to raise wages to retain talent, may be forced to boost salaries. Secondly, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has signaled the quits rate as an indicator she is following on her 'dashboard' for assessing progress in the labor market's recovery. The report follows figures last week that showed employers added 214,000 jobs in October after a 256,000 advance the prior month that was larger than first estimated. The unemployment rate fell to 5.8 percent, the lowest level since July 2008, from 5.9 percent the prior month. The October data lifted the monthly average employment gain so far in 2014 to 228,500, which would mark the strongest year since employers added an average 264,750 per month in 1999. Across the entire year, 5.03 million employees were added to staff, boosting the hiring rate to 3.6 percent and matching July's reading as the strongest since December 2007, the Labor Department reported today. 'The good news in this report is really the fact that there's more fluidity in the labor market, more activity there,' said Thomas Costerg, an economist at Standard Chartered Bank in New York. Optimism: Workers feel optimistic that they can leave their job and find another, the Labor Department says . 'People are ready to take more risks and seek jobs elsewhere.' In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 12,000 to 290,000 for the week ended Nov. 8. That was a bigger increase than expected, but claims have now been below 300,000 for nine straight weeks, suggesting firms are well past a cycle of elevated layoffs that began in the recession. 'This increase is nothing to worry about,' said Ian Shepherdson, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. 'Claims can remain close to their current trend for an extended period.' Yields on U.S. government debt were little changed following the publication of the two Labor Department reports.

chatgpt: According to a recent report from the U.S. Department of Labor, 2.8 million American workers voluntarily left their jobs in the month of September, marking the sharpest increase in the "quits rate" since 2008. The "quits rate" measures the percentage of employed individuals who voluntarily leave their jobs each month. This rate is seen as a key metric for measuring workers' confidence in the job market, as employees are more likely to leave their current job if they feel confident about finding a new one. Analysts say that the spike in the quits rate is a sign that American workers are increasingly optimistic about their job prospects. In recent years, the job market has improved significantly, with unemployment rates hitting historic lows and job creation remaining steady. As a result, workers may feel more comfortable leaving their current jobs in search of better opportunities elsewhere. This could force employers to boost wages and other benefits in order to retain top talent, as competition for skilled workers becomes more intense. "The quits rate is a key indicator of the health of the labor market," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. "It suggests that workers are confident in their ability to find higher-paying or more fulfilling jobs." The report also found that the number of job openings increased slightly in September, indicating that employers are still looking to fill positions despite the high quits rate. In addition, the number of Americans who were laid off or fired remained steady from the previous month. Overall, the latest data suggests that the U.S. job market remains strong, with workers feeling increasingly confident about their prospects. However, some analysts caution that a tight labor market could lead to wage inflation and other challenges for employers, who may struggle to find and retain skilled workers. "As the labor market continues to tighten, we could see upward pressure on wages, which could in turn contribute to higher inflation and interest rates," said David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. "Employers will need to be prepared to compete for workers in this environment." Despite these challenges, many analysts believe that the strong job market is a positive sign for the U.S. economy overall, as more Americans are able to find steady employment and contribute to economic growth. "The strength of the job market is one of the biggest drivers of economic growth in the U.S.," said Zandi. "As long as workers continue to feel confident and employers remain committed to hiring, we're likely to see continued positive momentum in the months ahead."
