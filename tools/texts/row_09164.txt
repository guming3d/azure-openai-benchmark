Both of the Tarpley boys were students at Poplar Springs Elementary School, with younger son Charlie in the special needs program, a spokesman for the school district confirmed. Neighbors who spoke with WXII said they didn't recall hearing gunshots. Another neighbor who lives across the street told the local Fox affiliate that she never sensed any marital problems and that the couple seemed dedicated to their special-needs son. 'Coleton revamped the whole inside of the house just to accommodate Charlie, you know; if there was something Charlie needed he would build it for him,' neighbor Amy Parsons said. According to Mrs Tarpley's Facebook, she worked as a stay-at-home mom. Despite Charlie's handicap, which appears to have left him wheelchair bound, photos posted to Facebook show the family living an active life - visiting amusement parks, ice skating and socializing at BBQs and other family events. The Stokes County Sheriff's Office and State Bureau of Investigation are currently investigating.
