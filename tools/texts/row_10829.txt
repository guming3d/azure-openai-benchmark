chatgpt: Stephen Graham, a 42-year-old man, has pleaded guilty to damaging four cars in Newcastle with polite phrases including "arbitrary" and "really wrong." Graham was caught on CCTV using a key to scratch and scrawl the offensive phrases on the cars. Newcastle University Professor, Andrea Samson, whose car was one of those damaged, claimed not to remember the vandalism taking place. Graham appeared at Newcastle Crown Court, where the judge heard how he had scribbled "really wrong" and "no trust" on Samson's car, and "arbitrary" and "all liars" on other cars nearby. He was arrested after police released CCTV footage of the incident, leading to a member of the public identifying him. In court, Graham admitted to the charges, saying he regretted his actions and was "embarrassed" by the matter. He apologized for his behavior and offered to pay for the damages caused to the vehicles. However, Newcastle University Professor, Andrea Samson, was not impressed with his apology, stating that she found it hard to believe that someone would want to damage her property with such phrases. "I find it hard to believe that someone would want to damage someone else's property in such a way, using polite phrases no less. However, Mr. Graham's apology is accepted, and I hope he learns from his actions and tries to become a better person going forward." The judge, who had presided over the case, said he was disappointed by the behavior exhibited by Graham, commenting that it was a "sad day" for Newcastle. "It's a sad day when polite phrases such as 'arbitrary' and 'really wrong' are used in such a way to damage someone else's property. It's not the time or the place to air grievances in this manner. I hope that Mr. Graham will learn from this experience and move on." Graham has now paid for the damages caused to the vehicles, and it is hoped that such incidents will not occur in the future.
