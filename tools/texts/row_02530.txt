article: Nairobi, Kenya (CNN)  -- Kenyan wildlife officials are ferrying thousands of zebras and wildebeest to a park in the country's south to feed starving lions and hyenas, and prevent a conflict with humans. The animals will be hauled from four locations to restock Amboseli National Park's population, which lost 80 percent of its herbivores in a recent drought, said Kentice Tikolo, spokeswoman for the Kenya Wildlife Service. "It was the worst drought in 26 years," Tikolo said. "The Amboseli ecosystem was severely affected. ... Lots of herbivores died, carnivores don't have anything to feed on, and have been attacking neighboring livestock." The imbalance has sparked a row with villagers who lost animals in the drought and have threatened to kill lions and hyenas preying on remaining livestock. Should the zebras be brought in to help the lions? "There are only 2,000 lions left nationwide, and we are concerned because the numbers are dropping," the spokeswoman said. "Maasais are getting angry and threatening to spear them -- the human versus wildlife conflict is getting out of hand -- and our carnivores are already greatly endangered." About 4,000 zebras and 3,000 wildebeest will be transferred to Amboseli. The zebras will go first. The wildebeest will follow, after calving season, Tikolo said. Once at Amboseli, they're expected to breed and sustain the lions over the long term. Shipping the animals from Soysambu Conservancy in the Rift Valley and three other nearby locations will cost about $ 1.4 million, according to Tikolo. The animals are herded into a funnel-shape enclosure using helicopters and loaded into trucks to Amboseli. From there, they are released into the wild, she said. Tourism is the second-largest source of foreign exchange in the east African nation. About 20 percent of the income comes from tourism, with Amboseli as the second -highest earner, Tikolo said . Lions are among the big five -- the list of top wildlife tourist attractions in the nation. Others are elephants, leopards, rhinos and buffalo.

chatgpt: In an effort to replenish the dwindling wildlife population in Amboseli National Park, authorities have brought in 4,000 zebras and 3,000 wildebeest to feed the park's lions. The park has been hit hard by an ongoing drought, which has claimed the lives of nearly 80 percent of the livestock in the area. The park is home to a wide variety of animals, including lions, elephants, giraffes, and zebras. However, the park's population has been severely impacted by the recent drought, which has left many animals without water and food. In response, park officials have decided to bring in large numbers of zebras and wildebeest from other areas, in hopes of boosting the park's population and providing food for the lions. The move has been praised by many conservationists, who see it as a necessary step in protecting the park's endangered species. "Amboseli National Park is a vital part of Kenya's ecosystem, and we need to do everything we can to protect its wildlife," said one wildlife expert. "Restocking the park with animals from other areas is a smart way to ensure that these species continue to thrive." Despite the positive response, there are concerns about the impact of introducing so many animals to the park at once. Some experts worry that the influx of new wildlife could disrupt the park's delicate ecosystem, leading to increased competition for resources and potential conflicts between the different species. Others believe that the animals may carry diseases or other threats that could harm the existing wildlife population. To mitigate these risks, park officials are carefully monitoring the animals and working to ensure that they are healthy and free from any potential threats. They are also working to gradually introduce the animals to the park's ecosystem, allowing them to adjust to their new environment and avoid any clashes with existing wildlife. Overall, the move to restock Amboseli National Park's population with 4,000 zebras and 3,000 wildebeest is a positive one, aimed at ensuring the survival of the park's endangered species. While there are risks involved, experts and officials are working to manage these risks and ensure that the animals are introduced to the park in a responsible and sustainable way.
