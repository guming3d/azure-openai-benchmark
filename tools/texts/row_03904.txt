Defeat: Holyhead Rugby Union XV's are pictured losing in spectacular fashion to Llanidloes on Saturday, with a final score of 181-0 . James Hart, Holyhead RUC spokesman, said: 'The lads were shell-shocked but we still had a giggle on the coach on the way home. 'The world record is 350-0 so we’re not there yet. 'Llanidloes is 120 miles from Holyhead and it takes three and a half hours to get there. 'A lot of the lads are self-employed or work in the morning, pre-match. 'So more than half of our team can miss away matches. 'On this occasion we only had five senior players and the rest were 18-year-old youth players. 'In the first 10 minutes, every time they came forward they had two players overlapping one of ours. 'The writing was on the wall. There was a big age difference and they were beefier. Their power drove us off the ball. 'But I was proud of our lads. It was boys against men. 'And afterwards, their coach and captain came over and praised the lads. They never stopped trying and competing.' Llanidloes vice chairman Simon Morgan said: 'It was a staggering result and our boys played exceptionally well - I think it’s a record scoreline.' In 2009, Midlands club Alcester thought they had earned a place in rugby union’s record books when they recorded a 194-3 win over Coventry Saracens. But the scoreline, a record winning margin for an English league game, has been wiped from the records after a ruling from local officials said Coventry Saracens who had only eight players - fell foul of the laws that insist scrums have a minimum of five players per side. The world record losing score of 350-0 was set by French Third Division . side Lavardac against Vergt in 1984.
