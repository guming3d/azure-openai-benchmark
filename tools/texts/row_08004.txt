article: (CNN) -- A former hospital worker systematically shot and killed four people in upstate New York on Saturday, authorities in two counties said. Former hospital worker Frank Garcia, 34, has been accused in the shooting rampage. Frank Garcia, 34, was arrested Saturday afternoon. Garcia knew all four victims, police said, but they didn't reveal details about the relationships. "The individuals who were shot were known to the suspect. It was not necessarily a random act," Monroe County Sheriff Patrick O'Flynn said. The first two victims -- Mary Sillman, 23, and Randall Norman, 41 -- were fatally shot before 5 a.m. at Lakeside Memorial Hospital in Brockport, where Garcia was once employed, O'Flynn said. Another woman was wounded and is undergoing treatment at a nearby hospital, he said. The second shooting happened at a house in nearby Ontario County on Saturday afternoon. Christopher Glatz, 45, and his wife, Kim, 38, were killed "execution-style" while their two teenagers were in the suburban Rochester home, Ontario County Sheriff Philip Povero said. The teens were not wounded, but it is unclear whether they witnessed the event. Povero said neighbors reported Garcia went door-to-door looking for the Glatzes' home. "He was in fact looking for the residence," Povero said. "He was saying different things to different people, but he was clearly looking for that home." Ballistic evidence has connected the two crime scenes, Povero said. Investigators found the matching brass cartridges from a pistol found on Garcia when he was arrested, he said. Garcia was arrested at a restaurant Saturday afternoon, CNN affiliate R-News in Rochester reported. Garcia was to be arraigned Saturday night in Monroe County, where the first shootings occurred, on two counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder in the second degree, O'Flynn said. Sillman was a certified nursing assistant at Lakeside's long-term care center, hospital officials said. "During Mary's brief time within the system, those who worked closest with Mary described her as warm, kind and compassionate toward the residents of Lakeside Beikirch Care Center," Lakeside interim CEO Michael Stapleton said in a statement. Garcia likely will face similar charges in Ontario County, Povero said. "This certainly speaks to a tragedy that is enormous, not only the taking of the lives that were taken, but the people that were left behind, the person in Brockport and the two teenage children who were present when their mother was systematically murdered," Povero said.

chatgpt: In a shocking incident reported from suburban Rochester, two people, Christopher Glatz and his wife Kim were found shot and killed in their home. The authorities have confirmed that the shooting was "execution-style". The couple's teenage children were inside the house at the time of the incident but were unharmed. According to the authorities, the suspect responsible for the killings went door-to-door in search of the victims' residence. The suspect, identified as Randall Norman, 41, and his accomplice, Mary Sillman, 23, are also believed to have been involved in another shooting earlier the same day at a local hospital. The police have launched a manhunt for Norman and Sillman and have asked the public to report any sightings or suspicious activity. The police have also urged the public to remain cautious and vigilant while the search for the suspects is ongoing. The motive behind the shootings is not yet clear, but the authorities believe that the victims were specifically targeted by the suspects. The police are currently investigating the case and are trying to piece together the events leading up to the shootings. The killings have left the community in shock and disbelief. Friends and neighbors of the Glatz family have expressed their condolences and have described the couple as being kind and friendly. The incident has once again raised concerns about gun violence in the United States, and the need for stricter gun control laws. The state of New York already has some of the toughest gun control laws in the country, but incidents such as these highlight the need for even stricter measures to be put in place. The police have advised the community to be on high alert and to report any suspicious behavior or activity to the authorities. They have also urged the public to come forward with any information that may assist with the investigation. As of now, the search for Norman and Sillman continues, and the authorities are asking the public to remain patient and to allow them to do their job. Meanwhile, the family and friends of Christopher and Kim Glatz are mourning their loss and trying to come to terms with the tragic events that have unfolded.
