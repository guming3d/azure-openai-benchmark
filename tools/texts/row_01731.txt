article: A pensioner branded a neighbour from hell has been warned that she must keep the peace for six months or face a fine after destroying a homeowner's flower bed - in an apparent row over a squirrel. Marion Webster, 78, has been reported to police at least 40 times by long-suffering neighbours for her anti-social behaviour. She was found guilty of criminal damage last October for tearing out £50 of flowers from a neighbour's flower beds at Solihull Magistrates Court. 'Neighbour from hell': Marion Webster has been warned by magistrates to keep the peace for six months after she was found guilty of criminal damage after ripping up a homeowner's flowerbeds . And yesterday she was ordered by magistrates to keep the peace for six months and warned she would be fined £50 if she continued to torment her neighbours. Neighbours say that the attack on the flowers came after Miss Webster became convinced that a resident had trained a squirrel to enter her garden. Kaya Ball, prosecuting, said police had been called to the pensioner's home numerous times over the past decade. She said: 'This isn't just an isolated incident of cutting some flowers. 'On the face of it, it seems trivial, but when it is presented as part of a long-standing neighbour dispute you can see there are several incidents.' But Sam Christopher, defending, said she was an elderly lady of 'previous good character.' Following sentencing, neighbours today branded Webster 'a neighbour from hell' and expressed anger at her lenient sentence. Row: Neighbours say that Miss Webster attacked a neighbour's flowers after a row over a squirrel that had been coming into her garden . One said: 'The last thing you expect to have when you move into a nice quiet neighbourhood like this one is an elderly woman acting like a yob. 'She is very proud of her garden and she got it into her head that someone had it in for her and was jealous of her flowers. 'She put up a big metal gate, extended the height of her fences and made the place into a fortress. 'Then she became convinced a resident had trained a squirrel to enter her garden after dark and tear up her flowers but everyone thought it was a joke. 'One night she cut someone's flowers up and tore up plants from the roots.' Another reported her to police for playing loud classical music at 3am. One claimed: 'She seems to enjoy causing a fuss and making everyone's life hell.' West Midlands Police confirmed they had been contacted more than 40 times since 2002 about alleged incidents including claims from Webster herself that she was a victim of flower vandals. A spokeswoman said: 'The force has been working in partnership with a vulnerable persons officer, social services and Solihull Community Housing to engage with everybody concerned and to resolve the problems in the area. 'There have been no complaints since October 2012.'

chatgpt: Marion Webster, a resident of a quiet suburban area in the North of England, has been found guilty of criminal damage by a magistrate's court. The 57-year-old woman had been accused of repeatedly vandalizing her neighbor's property, causing thousands of pounds in damage over the years. The court heard that Webster had been ordered to stay away from her neighbor's property, but she continued to cause damage, often in the dead of night. Her actions had led to police intervention on several occasions, and her neighbors had contacted the authorities a staggering 40 times in the past decade. Despite her claims of innocence, the evidence against Webster was overwhelming, and the magistrate's court had no choice but to find her guilty of the charges leveled against her. The presiding judge, in his ruling, noted that Webster's behavior was unacceptable, and that she needed to take responsibility for her actions. As part of Webster's sentencing, the court ordered her to keep the peace for the next six months, warning her that any further transgressions could result in a fine of up to £50. The sentence was designed to give Webster a chance to reflect on her actions and to prevent further damage to her neighbor's property. Speaking to reporters after the hearing, Webster expressed her regret over the damage she had caused, admitting that she had lost her temper on several occasions. She also expressed her gratitude to the court for giving her a chance to make amends and said that she would do everything in her power to keep the peace going forward. Despite Webster's contrition, her neighbors remain wary of her, with several expressing concern that she may resume her destructive behavior once the six-month sentence is up. Some have called for stricter penalties to be put in place, to deter others from similar behavior. The case of Marion Webster highlights the difficulties faced by neighbors in suburban areas, where disputes over property lines and noise violations can quickly spiral out of control. For many, the only recourse is to contact the authorities, who often struggle to contain the situation without resorting to heavy-handed tactics. As the authorities grapple with the issue of neighborhood disputes, some are calling for better education and communication between neighbors, to prevent misunderstandings and preventable conflicts from arising. Others are arguing for greater investment in community policing, as a means of building trust and diffusing potentially volatile situations. Whatever the solution may be, it is clear that the case of Marion Webster should serve as a warning to others who may be tempted to take matters into their own hands. The rule of law must be upheld, and individuals must be held accountable for their actions, no matter how personal or petty they may seem.
