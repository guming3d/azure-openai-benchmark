article: Think your commute is bad? Spare a thought for the small band of dedicated workers who live in Cornwall but work... in Shetland. Their gruelling 900-mile journey from one end of the UK to the other is revealed in analysis by the Office for National Statistics – which has found the most exhausting trips made by Britain’s 11.3million commuters. Some 175 Shetlanders work in other parts of Britain, with a further 494 journeying to their office in the remote northern isles from other parts of the country. A study into commutes by the Office for National Statistics found some people travel from their homes in Cornwall (pictured) to the Shetland Islands on a regular basis for work . This includes three people who regularly head to the islands from Cornwall – which is 700 miles as the crow flies and about 900 miles by the shortest commute. A handful travel to there from the South coast and London, with a further 195 people from across Britain regularly commuting to their workplace in Orkney. The lure of jobs in London also pulls in commuters from far and wide. Of the 867,630 who travel to the capital for work, 285 come from Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. Dozens even make the journey to London from the Highlands and Northern Ireland – plus two people from Orkney and one Shetlander. The distance from Cornwall to the Shetland Islands (pictured) is 700 miles as the crow flies but 900 miles for the shortest commute. The lengthy journey takes at least 24 hours by car . Previous analysis found that the average commute in England and Wales increased from 8.3 miles in 2001 to 9.3 miles in 2011. On average, workers in the East of England had the longest commute at 10.6 miles, while Londoners had the shortest commute at 6.8 miles. In both 2001 and 2011, men travelled further to work than women. This map shows the number of working residents in each local authority commuting to work in Greater London .

chatgpt: Three dedicated workers from Cornwall have been making a grueling commute to the Shetland Islands, covering a distance of over 700 miles as the crow flies. The journey, which involves ferry rides and long drives, is significantly longer, over 900 miles, as per the shortest commute. Despite the long commute, the workers have remained committed to their jobs and have been making the journey regularly. According to a recent report by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), their commute is one of the biggest on record. The workers, who have not been named, set off every Monday from their homes in Cornwall and make their way to the Shetland Islands, where they work. The journey involves a 200-mile drive from their homes in Cornwall to Aberdeen, followed by a 12-hour ferry ride to Lerwick, the capital of Shetland. The ONS report reveals that the average commute in the UK is 8.5 miles, while the average travel time is 27 minutes. In contrast, the intrepid Cornwall workers’ journey takes them more than 24 hours. Making such a long and arduous journey comes with many challenges. For the Cornwall trio, their journey involves spending the night on the ferry before disembarking in the morning and making a seven-hour drive to their place of work. This means they have to book accommodations every week during their 12-week shift. The Cornwall workers' journey is the latest example of the increasing lengths people are willing to go to find work or pursue their careers. With remote working becoming increasingly popular in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, people are showing that they are willing to travel long distances even if it means significant disruptions to their personal lives. Despite the challenges, the Cornwall workers remain committed to their jobs and continue to make the journey every week. Their dedication and determination serve as an inspiration to many, demonstrating that with the right mindset, people can achieve anything they set their minds to.
