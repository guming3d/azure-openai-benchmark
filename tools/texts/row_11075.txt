chatgpt: British television personality and former glamour model, Katie Price, 36, has opened up about her beauty regimen, revealing that she has never been one to wear make-up. The star, who first rose to prominence under the name Jordan, spoke to reporters about her thoughts on ageing, saying she believes dying your hair makes you look younger than opting for surgery. Price, who has been a tabloid fixture in the UK for over two decades, has always been known for experimenting with different looks. However, she maintains that the key to looking youthful is not to rely on cosmetic procedures. "I've never been one for wearing loads of make-up," Price said. "I think if you're naturally beautiful, then you don't need it. Plus, it takes ages to put on and it's expensive too. I'd rather just get up and go." Instead of relying on make-up, Price suggests that dyeing your hair can give you a more youthful appearance. She also recommends keeping up with regular exercise and maintaining a healthy diet to keep your body in shape. When asked about her plans for the future, Price shared that her main focus is on starting a family. "I can't wait to become a mother again," she said. "It's something I've always wanted and I'm excited to see what the future holds." In addition to expanding her family, Price also has several exciting projects in the works. She recently announced that she is launching her own line of clothing, which will be available online and in select stores. "I've always loved fashion and I'm really excited to be launching my own range," said Price. "It's going to be affordable and accessible to everyone, regardless of your size, shape or budget." Price is also set to star in a new reality show, which will follow her as she prepares to launch her fashion line and navigates the challenges of motherhood. "I'm excited to give viewers an inside look at my life," said Price. "It's not always easy balancing work and family, but I'm up for the challenge." Fans of the star are eagerly anticipating the release of her new ventures, with many expressing their support on social media. "Katie is a true inspiration," wrote one fan. "She's always been so real and down to earth. I can't wait to see what she has in store for us." While Price may be best known for her glamorous looks and over-the-top personality, it's clear that she has a lot more to offer than meets the eye. With her new clothing line and reality show, she's proving that she's a force to be reckoned with in the world of fashion and entertainment.
