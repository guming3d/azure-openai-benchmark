article: By . Mia De Graaf . Created: . 06:55 EST, 20 December 2013 . Banned: Paul Crick, 45, routinely called the emergency services and disturbed neighours by screaming and shouting . An alcoholic has been banned from swearing in his own home for five years after calling 999 over 170 times in 16 months - only to abuse them when they came to his aid. Paul Crick, 45, was finally arrested in August when his relentless calls to the emergency line, which started in April 2012, showed no sign of stopping. Neighbours in Waltham Abbey, Essex, also complained about Crick's constant shouting and swearing. Today, Essex Police revealed he has been given an ASBO that bars him from swearing anywhere - even in his own home. He is also banned from dialling 999 unless in a genuine emergency. An Essex Police spokesman said: 'The court heard how he makes regular unnecessary calls to the emergency services, causes a significant level of disturbance and distress to his neighbours. 'The ASBO was deemed necessary to prevent him from causing further harassment, alarm or distress to his neighbours. 'It was stated that Crick prevents the emergency services from dealing with cases of genuine emergency and appears to use any opportunity to abuse employees of Essex Police and the ambulance service.' Presiding magistrate Russell Pearson told Chelmsford Magistrate's Court: 'No shouting, even in your own home if you are heard by all your neighbours.' Crick, who told the court he is attending an alcohol support group and psychiatrist, did not object to the ruling and Â£200 costs. Crick was handed an ASBO that bars him from NHS premises and calling the emergency line for five years . The order states Crick must not contact the emergency services via 999 save when genuinely in need of assistance of those services or use foul language in a public place or in his home. He is also banned from acting in a threatening manner towards people not of his own household, and must leave NHS premises if ordered by a member of staff. The ASBO expires on December 16, 2018.

chatgpt: A man in Essex has been banned from swearing in public or in his home, following a series of abusive incidents. Paul Crick, aged 45, has a history of disturbing his neighbours with shouting and swearing, prompting emergency services to be called on multiple occasions. Crick's behaviour reached a new level last month, when he flooded the emergency line with calls and then verbally abused medics on their arrival. The incident earned him an Anti-Social Behaviour Order (ASBO) which will require him to control his language or face further consequences. Neighbours in the area have expressed relief that something has been done to address the problem. One local resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: "It's been a nightmare living next to Crick. He's just constantly shouting and swearing, and it's really unsettling. I'm glad that the authorities have finally taken action against him." The ASBO, which was granted by the court, also bans Crick from causing distress to his neighbours or making any noise that would be likely to cause a disturbance. It is hoped that this will help to improve the quality of life for those living close to him. Commenting on the case, a spokesperson for the local council said: "Anti-social behaviour is not acceptable in any form, and we take reports of such incidents very seriously. We hope that this ASBO serves as a warning to others who may be considering behaving in a similar way." This is not the first time that ASBOs have been used to address anti-social behaviour in the UK. In recent years, there has been a growing trend towards using legal measures to combat disruptive behaviour, with the aim of creating safer and more peaceful communities. While some critics argue that ASBOs are punitive and do not address the root causes of anti-social behaviour, many others believe that they are an effective means of dealing with the issue. It remains to be seen whether the ASBO granted to Crick will have a positive impact on his behaviour, but for now, his neighbours can breathe a little easier knowing that the authorities have taken action.
