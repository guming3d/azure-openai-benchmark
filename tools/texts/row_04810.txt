He said: 'I find their haunting melancholy completely absorbing; all of these photographs now torn out, disembodied and forgotten - they've now become fully and utterly the masks and phantoms they dragged up as, all those years ago.' Brown was fascinated by the creativity of people who were living in poverty, but still managed to create 'incredible and phantasmagorical apparitions'. David Lynch, who wrote the foreword of the book, said: 'All the clocks had stopped. A void out of time. And here they are – looking out and holding themselves still – holding still at that point where two worlds join – the familiar – and the other.'

chatgpt: British artist Ossian Brown has recently published a book titled "Haunted Air," which features a collection of spooky Halloween photographs. The book showcases a range of vintage photos, dating back to 1875, tracking the evolution of Halloween costumes and trends. From the earliest homemade costumes to commercial ones from shops, "Haunted Air" offers a rare glimpse into the spooky history of Halloween. A notable feature of the photos is the sinister appearance of the earliest handmade costumes when compared to the ones from shops. The earliest pictures show children and adults dressed in creepy attire, with masks and props that are sure to send a chill down anyone's spine. The homemade costumes were often made from scratch using whatever materials were at hand, so some of them look quite crude and frightening. The photographs feature a range of animals from the cute to the creepy. Some dressed up as rabbits or cats, while others chose to transform into bats or spiders. Of course, no Halloween collection would be complete without the classic creepy crawlies that make our skin crawl. In addition to different animals, devils, witches, and ghosts appear to be a top choice for dressing up in the early days of Halloween. These costumes often featured intricate designs and were often accessorized with props like brooms or cauldrons to complete the look. The photos depict a wide range of ages, from children to adults, all dressed up for the spooky season. Ossian Brown, the British artist behind "Haunted Air," is himself quite interested in the history of horror and the paranormal. He has worked on several art projects and books that explore these themes, and "Haunted Air" is just the latest offering. The book is more than just a collection of photographs; it's a historical record of Halloween costumes and trends from the late 19th century to the mid-20th century. The images not only provide a spooky glimpse into the past, but they also offer a valuable insight into the evolution of Halloween, from its origins as a pagan harvest festival to the commercialized holiday we know today. In a world where Halloween has become all about commercialism and plastic costumes, "Haunted Air" is a breath of fresh air. It takes us back to simpler times when Halloween was less about getting candy and more about scaring people. Brown's book shows us that the spirit of Halloween has always been about celebrating the spooky and eerie, and that's something we can all get behind.
