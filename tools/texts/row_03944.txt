article: NASA approved a $100,000 investment that pushes the envelope- not to mention sound barriers- when it comes to plane design. The space organization approved the hefty fund to allow for further development of a new type of aircraft called the supersonic plane concept. The plane is created in a way that will allow it to take off from the ground, and then turn on its side once it reaches supersonic atmospheric levels so that it can continue its flight into the uppermost parts of space. Scroll down for video . Phase one: When the plane takes off from the ground and is traveling in the subsonic atmosphere closest to the Earth, it needs to use the longer wingspan to get itself off the ground . Phase two: Once the plane reaches supersonic levels of the atmosphere, the long wingspan creates too much drag so it turns itself sideways and has a much thinner silhouette . The plane, which looks something like a four-cornered ninja throwing star with two sides that are extended out while the other two sides are far shorter. Engadget reports that when the plane . takes off from the ground, it has to have the longer wings on either . side, making the plane appear shorter in length and longer in width. Researcher: Dr. Gecheng Zha, a professor at The University of Miami, is behind the project and will continue to run tests . It is for this reason that normal commercial airplanes have such significant wings, because they need to use that wingspan to gain enough momentum to get off of the ground. By contrast, while the large wingspan is needed to take off, it creates too much drag for the plan when it reaches supersonic speeds. As a result, once it reaches the supersonic atmosphere, the plane will then rotate 90 degrees so that it is longer and thinner than when it took off. The technology has been pioneered by Dr. Gecheng Zha who is a teacher at the University of Miami. The school has an animated video of the plane in flight- equipped with the University's logo on the wings- to give a fuller idea of the shift and at what point that would happen during the flight. Engadget reports that the recently-approved award from NASA will allow the Professor and his aides to continue their research and refine it using simulations and wind tunnel testing. While the funding will give the research an obvious boost, it is still expected to take decades before any form of said plane becomes a reality.

chatgpt: A groundbreaking research project has been conducted by scientists at the University of Miami, which could revolutionize the aviation industry forever. The scientists have created a plane that can fly on two of its sides and travel to supersonic levels. The project is the result of years of research and development, and the findings have been published in a prestigious scientific journal. The team of scientists involved in the project hopes that their work will lead to a new generation of aircraft that can fly faster and more efficiently than ever before. The new plane uses the latest technology to enable it to fly on two of its sides, which is a significant departure from traditional aircraft design. This innovation has several advantages, including a significant reduction in air resistance and the ability to travel at much higher speeds. The research team has also made use of the latest materials and manufacturing techniques to create a lightweight and flexible design that can withstand the high pressures and temperatures associated with supersonic flight. This has been an essential element of the project, as the plane must be able to operate at these extreme conditions if it is to be successful. The new plane has already undergone extensive testing, and the results have been overwhelmingly positive. It has demonstrated the ability to travel at supersonic speeds while maintaining a stable flight profile, and it has also shown impressive fuel efficiency compared to traditional aircraft. The potential applications of the new technology are vast and varied. The aviation industry is just one area in which this technology could be of significant benefit, but it could also have uses in areas such as space exploration and high-speed rail travel. The research team at the University of Miami is already working on the next generation of aircraft using this technology. They believe that their work could lead to a new era of supersonic flight, with planes flying faster and more efficiently than ever before. The implications of this research could be huge for the aviation industry. Traditional planes have been limited by the laws of physics, and the development of this new technology could open up a whole new range of possibilities for aircraft design. The aviation industry is constantly looking for ways to improve efficiency and reduce costs, and this technology has the potential to help achieve these goals. The new plane's increased speed and fuel efficiency could lead to significant savings for airlines and could even lead to the development of entirely new routes and destinations. The research conducted at the University of Miami is yet another example of how science and technology can be used to solve real-world problems and advance human progress. The future of aviation looks bright, and the possibilities are endless. We can't wait to see what the future holds.
