article: (CNN) -- A giant cross that has stood on a Southern California mountain for decades must be removed because it violates the constitutional separation of church and state, a judge ordered this week. The order Thursday by U.S. District Judge Larry Burns continues a long legal battle about the 43-foot cross atop Mt. Soledad in San Diego. Burns ordered that the cross would have to be removed within 90 days. But the cross may be able to stay if the case is appealed, the judge ordered. "Of course we are disappointed in what the ruling is -- that is to take the cross down," Bruce Bailey, president of the Mount Soledad Memorial Association told CNN affiliate KGTV. Bailey said his organization plans to appeal, which would mean the cross would stay as the decades-long legal battle continued. Long legal battle . The cross was erected in 1954 in honor of Korean War veterans and has been the subject of near constant judicial back and forth since 1989, when two Vietnam War veterans filed suit saying it violated the California Constitution's "No Preference" clause. Since the first lawsuit in 1989, the city of San Diego twice tried selling the property beneath the cross to the Mount Soledad Memorial Association, only to be stopped by the courts. In 2004, the parties involved reached an agreement that would have moved the cross to a nearby church, but two congressmen intervened and inserted a rider into the 2005 omnibus budget bill that designated the property a national veterans memorial and authorized the federal government to accept the donation of the property. This led to more fights and more court filings. In 2006, three congressmen pushed through a bill calling for the government to seize the property by eminent domain -- calling it "a historically significant war memorial." The federal government took possession in August of that year. A lawsuit was filed challenging that transfer almost immediately and that has led to Thursday's ruling.

chatgpt: After decades of controversy, a judge has finally ruled that the giant cross in San Diego must be removed within 90 days. The legal battle surrounding the 29-foot Latin cross atop Mount Soledad has been ongoing since the 1980s, with various parties arguing over whether it represents a religious symbol or a secular war memorial. The most recent case was brought by the Freedom From Religion Foundation in 2016, which argued that the cross violated the Establishment Clause of the Constitution. The judge ultimately agreed, finding that the cross sends a message that the government endorses Christianity and therefore is unconstitutional. However, that is not the end of the story. While the judge ordered the cross to be removed within 90 days, he also issued a stay that would allow it to remain if the case is appealed. This means that the cross could potentially stay in place for several more years if the defendants choose to challenge the ruling. The Mount Soledad cross has been a point of contention in San Diego for decades. It was originally erected in 1913 as a private memorial, but was later donated to the city and moved to its current location on public land in the 1950s. Over the years, various groups have sought to have the cross removed or replaced with a secular symbol. Advocates for the cross argue that it is an important part of the city's history and represents the sacrifices made by American soldiers in wartime. They also maintain that it is not a specifically religious symbol, but rather a cultural icon that holds significance for many people. Opponents, however, contend that the cross is explicitly religious and therefore violates the separation of church and state. They also argue that the city should not be using public land to promote one particular religion over others. The judge's ruling is a significant victory for those who believe in the strict separation of church and state. However, the fate of the Mount Soledad cross remains uncertain as the legal battle continues.
