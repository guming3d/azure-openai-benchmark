Britain’s smallest man has been fitted with the world’s smallest hearing aid, it has been claimed. Michael Henbury, the 2ft 11in actor best known as a Harry Potter goblin, has a pair of invisible devices that fit inside the ear canal. He apparently needed a small device because he has tiny eardrums. Mr Henbury, 51, who played an Ewok in Return of the Jedi, as well as his role in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, said he is delighted with the results. He said: 'I suddenly noticed I couldn’t hear very well and in busy rooms I was unable to join in on conversations. Until this point my hearing was fine.' He has been using the Starkey hearing aids, which claim to be the world’s first invisible-in-the-canal instruments, for about a year. 'Nobody even knows I have them in,' said Mr Henbury. 'Once I tell people they are amazed as they can’t even tell. 'I even have to remind myself to take them out at night, they are just fantastic and have made such a difference to my life. 'I couldn’t have anything too complex or big and bulky and I had already been told to rule out any surgery as it would be too risky and difficult. “My height has never really been a huge issue but when I started to experience hearing loss it really began to affect my life and I needed to do something about it. 'It’s ironic as I’m the smallest man in Britain and I’m now wearing the smallest hearing aids available - it’s like they have been designed especially for me!' said Michael. Mr Henbury, who also played an Ewok in Return of the Jedi, said hearing loss had really affected his life . Neil Pottinger from Starkey said: 'Invisible hearing aids have revolutionised the way hearing loss is perceived by millions of people. Hearing aid technology has advanced so much, even if you have a hearing defect nobody even know. For many people these discreet hearing devices are the perfect solution.' Mr Henbury added: 'Without the hearing aids my life would be so different, I would almost definitely have a reduced quality of life and would be unable to hear anything.' Around 2 million people own a hearing aid in the UK, but only 1.4 million people actually use one on a regular basis. Embarrassment of wearing hearing aids is thought to deter some from wearing them.
