chatgpt: Chelsea secured their place in the Capital One Cup final after a dramatic extra-time victory over Liverpool at Stamford Bridge. The Blues were made to work hard for their place in the final by a determined Liverpool side, but it was Branislav Ivanovic who proved to be the hero for the home side with a late goal. The game had been a tense and closely fought affair, with both sides having chances to take the lead. Liverpool had the better of the first half, with Raheem Sterling and Lazar Markovic causing all sorts of problems for the Chelsea defence. The home side, though, were able to hold firm and went into half-time with the score still goalless. Chelsea came out strongly in the second half and began to take control of the game, with Eden Hazard and Willian both looking dangerous on the break. Despite this, the Blues were unable to find the breakthrough, and the game went into extra-time. It was in the second period of extra-time that Ivanovic proved to be the hero for Chelsea. The Serbian defender rose highest from a corner to head home the winner and send the Stamford Bridge faithful into delirium. It was a fitting end to a hard-fought and intense cup tie, and one that will live long in the memory of Blues fans. After the match, Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho was full of praise for his players, particularly Ivanovic. Speaking to the media, Mourinho said, "Branislav Ivanovic is a great player, a great professional, and a man with a huge heart. His blood filled boot should be shown to the academy players to inspire them. He is a true example of what it means to be a Chelsea player." The win means that Chelsea will now play either Sheffield United or Tottenham in the Capital One Cup final, which will take place at Wembley Stadium on March 1st. The Blues will be strong favourites to lift the trophy, and will no doubt be looking to add to their impressive trophy haul under the guidance of Mourinho. The win also keeps Chelsea firmly in the hunt for a domestic treble. The Blues currently sit top of the Premier League table, and are still involved in both the FA Cup and the Champions League. With such a strong squad and a talented manager in charge, Chelsea will be confident that they can achieve success on all fronts this season. In conclusion, Chelsea secured their place in the Capital One Cup final with a thrilling victory over Liverpool at Stamford Bridge.
