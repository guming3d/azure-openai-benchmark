article: (CNN)We all know that every baby is special, but Silas Philips pulled off a rare feat right out of the womb. Days before he's scheduled to leave the hospital, he's already gone viral on social media because he was born 'en caul.' Silas was completely encased in his amniotic sac, said Los Angeles' Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in a Facebook post. That's so rare, that even doctors delivering babies hardly see it. So Silas' doctor snapped a photo with his cell phone. It looked like the baby was trapped in a big water bubble. "Even though it's a cliche -- we caught our breath," neonatologist William Binder told CNN affiliate KCAL. "It really felt like a moment of awe." Then Binder got to work helping Silas to breathe - and giving him special care, because Silas was born three months before his due date via Caesarean section. Later, Silas' grandmother showed the cell phone photo to his mother, Chelsea Philips. "It was definitely like a clear film, where you could definitely make out his head and his hair," Philips told the affiliate. Silas was curled up in fetal position inside. The amniotic sac is an opaque bubble that covers all babies in the womb from right after conception. As the baby grows, it fills with fluid, including the baby's urine. The sac cushions the baby from bumps and jostles during mom's daily ups and downs. Normally, during a birth, it breaks, and the fluid rushes out, which is where the term 'breaking water' comes from. But sometimes, the sac can get stuck around part of the baby, according to Dr. Amos Grunebaum, an obstetrician and gynecologist, who publishes a website on birth and baby care. It can, for example, get stuck on the baby's head, which makes it look like its wearing a glass space helmet. That's also where the term caul comes from -- it derives from Latin words that refer to a helmet. After IVF shock, mom gives birth to two sets of identical twins . Such amniotic sac helmet births are rare enough, but to have the entire baby inside the sac, or 'en caul,' occurs in less than one in 80,000 births, Cedars-Sinai said. When Philips heard how rare her Baby's birth was, she was flabbergasted. "I was like, oh my gosh, Silas, you're a little special baby," she told KCAL. It's particularly surprising in a C-section, because the scalpel usually pierces the amniotic sac. The doctors must have missed Silas's. Florida woman gives birth to 14.1-pound baby boy .

chatgpt: A baby boy born "en caul," where the infant is completely surrounded by the amniotic sac, has captured the attention of medical professionals and social media users alike. Silas Philips, born on Thursday, May 19th at California's Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, has received widespread recognition for being an extremely rare case, with fewer than one in 80,000 births resulting in such an occurrence. When Silas entered the world, he appeared already cradled in a protective bubble, a sight that left the medical team stunned. Doctors at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center quickly broke the membrane to allow the baby to breathe, but the rare phenomenon was captured in breathtaking photos which have since gone viral on social media. While being born en caul is a rarity, some cultures consider it to be a lucky sign, often associated with good luck, protection, or even supernatural powers. In the past, the birth of a child en caul was believed to be a sign of a child's or family's future success. In some cultures, women who gave birth en caul were believed to have an easier delivery the next time around. According to medical professionals, babies born en caul usually experience a normal delivery, and the membrane can be quickly and safely removed, allowing the infant to breathe normally. Silas, who weighed in at just over 6 pounds and measured 19 inches long, is healthy and already on his way home with his parents, who added that they were delighted to have a happy and healthy son. Silas's birth has also spurred discussions about childbirth practices, highlighting the ongoing debate between natural and medicalised childbirth. While natural childbirth is often viewed as a more holistic and healthy option for expecting parents, modern medical practices and technological advancements have created a safer environment for both mother and baby.  Though many believe in the good luck and fortune of being born en caul, doctors stress that childbirth remains an unpredictable and often dangerous process for both mother and child. Many mothers worldwide continue to give birth in unsterile or culturally specific conditions, increasing the risk of complications, infections, and even maternal and neonatal mortality. Silas's birth, while unique, serves as a reminder of the importance of safe and informed birthing practices, and the need for proper medical attention and care for both mothers and babies. Though rare occurrences such as his may capture the public's attention, it is crucial for expectant parents to remember that childbirth can be complicated, and their priority should be the health and safety of their child, above any cultural or superstitious beliefs.
