article: By . Wills Robinson . Major commercial airlines have created a virtual 'no fly' zone' over Ukraine after cancelling or redirecting flights in the wake of the attack on flight MH17. British Airways, KLM and Virgin Atlantic are among the international operators who have altered their journeys after the Malaysia Airlines aircraft was shot down  near the Russia-Ukraine border. The traffic control body Eurocontrol has also advised airlines to avoid the area as a safety precaution. Scroll down for video . Avoiding the area: A map from airline tracker FlightRadar24, shows that a large number of planes (highlighted in yellow) have been diverted away from Ukrainian airspace . Airliner tracking sites, including FlightRadar24, are indicating that traffic is now steering clear of Ukrainian airspace. Air France, KLM, Turkish Airlines, Alitalia and Delta have also diverted their services while German providers Lufthansa said they were taking a 'wide detour' around the region. A Â spokesman for the UK Civil Aviation Authority said: 'The Ukrainian authorities are responsible for managing their airspace and the UK or other countries cannot enforce airspace restrictions in the area. 'However, the CAA has previously issued advice to UK airlines on operating in this area and following this incident, Eurocontrol (the European air traffic control body) has issued advice to airlines to plan routes that avoid the area.' A British Airways spokesman said the only flight that would be flying in the area was the daily service between Heathrow and Kiev. 'The safety and security of our customers is always our top priority.' they said. 'Our flights are not using Ukrainian airspace with the exception of our once-a-day service between Heathrow and Kiev. We are keeping this service under review but Kiev is several hundred kilometres from the incident site.' A spokesman for Virgin Atlantic said: 'Our thoughts are with all involved in the recent Malaysian Airlines incident. We are closely monitoring the situation and as a precautionary measure are re-routing a small number of flights this evening.' Doomed journey: A picture shows Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 taking off from Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam . The flights are the Heathrow to Dubai route and the Mumbai to Heathrow route. Budget airlines Ryaniar and Easyjet have not been affected as they do not use Ukrainian air space. Delta tweeted: 'Out of an abundance of caution, Delta is not routing flights through Ukrainian airspace.' Many airlines had continued to use the route despite warnings not to because of the fighting, said Norman Shanks, former head of group security at airports group BAA and professor of aviation security at Coventry University in England. 'It is a busy aviation route and there have been suggestions that a notice was given to aviators telling airlines to avoid that particular area,' Shanks said. 'But Malaysia Airlines, like a number of other carriers, have been continuing to use it because it is a shorter route, which means less fuel and therefore less money.'

chatgpt: Multiple major airlines have made the decision to redirect their services away from the Iranian airspace. British Airways, KLM, Emirates, and Virgin have all taken this decision. German airline Lufthansa has also made the decision to take a "wide detour" of the region. The decision was prompted by increasing tensions between the US and Iran. On Friday, a US drone was shot down by Iran, with both countries stating different reasons for the action. The US claims that the drone was in international airspace whilst Iran claims that the drone had entered their airspace. This action by Iran has led to a warning from the European air traffic control body, Eurocontrol, who have advised airlines to use other routes. Eurocontrol states that the warning is due to the potential for "misidentification" of civil aircraft in the region. This warning has led to several airlines deciding to take action to ensure the safety of their passengers. British Airways, for example, has stated that all services traveling to and from India, and certain other countries in the Middle East, will avoid the Iranian airspace. KLM has made a similar decision affecting flights to and from Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta. Virgin has stated that they have re-routed a small number of flights away from Iran and Emirates has yet to make a formal statement on the matter. However, the most dramatic decision thus far has been from Lufthansa, who have stated that all services to and from Asia will take a "wide detour" of the region. This decision will have a significant impact on the airline's operations, but they have taken this decision in light of the potential risk to their passengers. The tensions between the US and Iran are not a new issue. There have been numerous diplomatic and military incidents between the two countries over several decades. However, this latest incident has brought the issue back to the forefront, with many concerned about the potential for a military conflict between the two nations. The decision by these major airlines to avoid the Iranian airspace is not unexpected, and it is likely that other airlines will follow suit. The safety of the passengers should always be the top priority for any airline, and in light of the current situation, it is clear that this decision is necessary. The impact of this decision on the affected airlines will be significant, with many having to change their operations at short notice. However, it is clear that the safety of the passengers must always come first, and these airlines have made the decision to take action to ensure this. In conclusion, the decision by British Airways, KLM, Emirates, Virgin, and Lufthansa to avoid the Iranian airspace is a necessary one. The tensions between the US and Iran are a concern for many, and the potential for a military conflict is a real one. The safety of passengers must always be the top priority for any airline, and these airlines have taken the appropriate action to ensure this. It remains to be seen how long this situation will continue, but for now, these airlines have made the right decision.
