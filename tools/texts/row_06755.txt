article: Illustrated is the 1215 sealing of the Magna Carta - a document that ushered in the basic rights that underpin British democracy . It was the tree beneath which King John sealed the Magna Carta – the document that first ushered in the basic rights that underpin British democracy to this day. Now, exactly eight centuries after that historic event, experts have preserved the yew tree for eternity. Saplings grown from cuttings of the tree have been planted in a hedge in Edinburgh’s Botanic Gardens, added to those of other historic yews as part of a conservation project. The Ankerwycke yew, which has a girth of 26ft and stands in a water meadow on the flood plain of the Thames, is now approximately 2,000 years old. Scientists at the gardens have created the hedge to preserve their genetic material amid fears that Britain’s historic trees are threatened by a variety of diseases. Famed for the signing of the document at Runnymede in 1215 – although the exact site is still disputed by historians – the Ankerwycke yew is also said to be the site of the first meeting between Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. It is named after the manor of Ankerwycke, part of the estate of Richard de Montfichet, one of the 25 barons who were present as King John gave his seal to the Magna Carta. Martin Gardner, who leads the gardens scheme in Edinburgh, said: ‘We are losing ancient yews all the time, to climate change, development and vandalism. These are the most iconic trees in the world. We have to conserve every single one.’ The initiative comes as celebrations of the 800th anniversary of the signing of the document move to Parliament, with an exhibition of all four existing copies of the Charter opening there this week. The manuscripts, two held by the British Library and one each by Lincoln and Salisbury Cathedrals, laid the foundations of the rule of law. The Ankerwycke yew was named as one of Britain’s 50 great trees in 2002 to mark the Queen’s Golden Jubilee. Cuttings in the hedge also come from a yew said to have featured in William Wordsworth’s 1803 poem Yew Trees, set in Yorkshire, and from the Fortingall Yew in Perthshire, reputed to be 4,000 years old. The Ankerwycke yew, under which the Magna Carter was sealed in 1215, will now be preserved forever .

chatgpt: A historic yew tree in Runnymede, called the Ankerwycke yew, is set to be preserved forever under a new initiative that aims to keep it alive and thriving for future generations. This ancient tree has witnessed many significant events in British history. One such event was the signing of the Magna Carter by King John in 1215, which paved the way for democracy and human rights. The Magna Carter is one of the most important legal documents in world history. It is considered by many to be the foundation of democracy, and it established the rights of the individual and the principle of the rule of law. It is no surprise that King John chose to seal this important document under the shadow of the Ankerwycke yew, which is one of the oldest trees in Britain, believed to be around 2,500 years old. The Ankerwycke yew is also famous for another reason. It was here that Henry VIII met Anne Boleyn for the first time in 1526. The couple is said to have strolled under the ancient yew, which stood as a silent witness to the beginning of one of the most turbulent periods in British history. Today, the Ankerwycke yew is showing signs of age, and there is a concern that it may not survive for much longer. In response to this, a new initiative has been launched, with the aim of preserving the tree for future generations. The initiative involves taking cuttings from the yew and planting them in other locations. One such location is Edinburgh, where a hedge has been planted with saplings grown from the cuttings. The new initiative has been welcomed by conservation experts, who believe that it is essential to protect the Ankerwycke yew, as it is not only a historic icon but also a unique living organism. Yew trees are exceptionally long-lived trees and can often survive for thousands of years. They are also considered to be ecosystems in their own right, hosting a vast array of flora and fauna. This new initiative is not only about preserving the Ankerwycke yew but also about raising awareness of the essential role that trees play in our environment. Trees are often undervalued, but they are crucial in mitigating the effects of climate change, providing oxygen, and sustaining biodiversity. In conclusion, the Ankerwycke yew may be ancient, but it is still very relevant to the present day. Its preservation under the new initiative is not only important for its historical significance but also for its role in sustaining life as we know it. As we move forward, we must continue to value and protect our natural heritage, including the mighty Ankerwycke yew.
