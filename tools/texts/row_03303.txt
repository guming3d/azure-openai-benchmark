article: The kidnapped father of Chelsea footballer John Obi Mikel has been released alive by his captors in the Nigerian city of Kano. Michael Obi went missing from Jos -- the main city in Plateau State in central Nigeria -- on August 12 and had not been seen or heard of since. Mikel was informed of the kidnap just hours before Chelsea's opening game of the English Premier League season at Stoke but decided to play. He also played the full 90 minutes in Saturday's 2-1 victory over West Brom. A statement released by Mikel's management company, Sport Entertainment & Media Group, confirmed the news. "SEM are delighted to confirm, that earlier today Michael Obi called his family to advise them that he had been released by his abductors. "SEM have waited until now to release this information, to ensure that Michael was safe. "John Obi Mikel would like to thank everyone in Nigeria, his family & friends, Chelsea FC & their fans & his agents for their total support during this terrible time. "A full statement of the situation will be released by SEM tomorrow (Tuesday) morning." According to AFP, five men have been arrested in connection with Michael's kidnapping. They quoted Michael explaining his abduction: "I was taken right deep into the bush, in an isolated area in Jos (in central Nigeria). I started begging them, yet they beat me mercilessly, kicking me with their boots. "There are five of them and they were dressed in military uniforms. They pushed me into a vehicle painted in military colors and began to drive very fast. I never knew a vehicle can fly like that." Chelsea released their own statement on Monday, that read: "All at Chelsea Football Club are delighted that John Mikel Obi's father, Michael, has been found safe in Nigeria. "Mikel has shown outstanding commitment and professionalism during this most difficult of times, and the club will continue to offer its full support to him and his family."

chatgpt: Michael Obi, the father of Chelsea footballer John Obi Mikel, who was kidnapped in the city of Jos on August 12 has been released alive. The news has been confirmed by both Mikel's management company and Chelsea Football Club. The 74-year-old was abducted by unknown gunmen while he was travelling in his car. His kidnappers had reportedly demanded a ransom of around N10m ($28,000) for his release. The incident had caused great distress to Mikel, who was playing for Chelsea at the time. However, the midfielder continued to play in both of Chelsea's Premier League games this season despite the ongoing crisis. The news of his father's safe release has brought joy to both Mikel and his family. A spokesperson from Mikel's management company stated that "Michael Obi has been released by his abductors. He is now safe, healthy and reunited with his family." Chelsea Football Club also released a statement, saying that "We are pleased to confirm that Michael Obi, father of Mikel, has been released unhurt following his abduction." The incident had also brought attention to the issue of kidnapping in Nigeria, a country where such incidents have become increasingly common. Jos, in particular, has been a hotbed of violence due to disputes over land and resources. Many Nigerians took to social media to express their relief and joy at the news of Michael Obi's release. Ibrahim Maikudi, a resident of Jos, said "This is great news. I hope this sends a message to those who think they can get away with such heinous crimes." Mikel, who has played for Chelsea since 2006, is regarded as one of the best midfielders in the Premier League. His father's release will undoubtedly come as a huge relief to the footballer, who will now be able to focus on his game without any further distractions.
