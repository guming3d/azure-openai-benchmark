chatgpt: A US Airways plane was forced to make an emergency landing at Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston on Monday evening. The pilot was forced to make the emergency landing after realizing that the landing gear was not functioning properly. The landing gear did not come down as expected, and the cabin quickly began to fill up with smoke. Upon realizing the severity of the situation, the pilot immediately followed emergency procedures and contacted the control tower to prepare for the crash landing. Passengers were instructed to assume the "brace" position, and as the aircraft touched down, the cabin crew deployed the emergency slides, allowing passengers to evacuate the aircraft. The passengers were forced to slide down the inflatable chutes located on either side of the plane, and officials say everyone on board was able to exit the plane safely. However, one passenger was sent to a local hospital with unknown injuries. According to reports, the plane was en route to Houston from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Passengers described the scene inside the cabin as terrifying, with many praising the pilot for his quick thinking in the face of the emergency.
