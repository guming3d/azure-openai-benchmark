She answered six questions about her experience on iReport.com: . Top not-to-be-missed experience. Why? Riding the bus from Puerto Princesa up through the heart of the island to El Nido, at the northern shore ... it's the ultimate Filipino experience: crowded into a small dirty bus with open windows and beautiful people of all ages and stories. Plus you have time to marvel at the rugged beauty, squalor, and everything in between. First impression, and did it change?

I walked out of the bathroom and looked out the huge windows of the airport, across the runway to the green hills and palms beyond. And I knew that this would be a life-changing adventure. My impression didn't change, and I consider my time in Palawan a very worthwhile education. Share your trips on iReport.com: Just back from . Lasting memory .
