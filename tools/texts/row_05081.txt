chatgpt: A group of three tourists visiting Zimbabwe had a close encounter with a seven-tonne bull elephant while posing for pictures at the Imire: Rhino and Wildlife Conservation park. Jane Burnett, Nicky Walker, and Sarah Daly were sitting for a photo when the elephant crept up behind them, waving its trunk. The women had been enjoying a tour of the park, which is renowned for its efforts to conserve rhinos and other wild animals. As they posed for the photo, they were unaware of the elephant's presence behind them. Suddenly, the elephant made its presence known by waving its trunk and coming up behind the three women. It was an alarming moment for the tourists, who had not expected to be so close to such a huge wild animal. Despite the initial shock, the three women managed to stay calm and still, allowing the elephant to pass by without incident. They later described the experience as "amazing" and "unforgettable." Park officials stressed that the incident was a rare occurrence, and that visitors to the park should always be aware of their surroundings and follow the guidelines set out by the park. They also reminded visitors not to approach wild animals, and to keep a safe distance at all times.
