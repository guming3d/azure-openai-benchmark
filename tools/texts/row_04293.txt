A Florida woman who climbed on top of a manatee and rode the creature while swimming at a Florida beach on Sunday has turned herself in - and she may be charged with a crime. Manatees - large, underwater mammals also known as sea cows - are protected in the state and it is a crime to 'intentionally annoy, harass or disturb' the animals. But that didn't stop Ana Gloria Garcia Gutierrez - dressed in a black and white bikini top, red boardshorts and a white cap - from catching a ride on one of the creatures at Fort DeSoto Park. Molestation: Police are on the hunt for the woman, pictured, who was snapped riding a manatee on Sunday . Pinellas County Sheriff's deputies rushed to the beach at about 1pm after receiving reports of a woman 'riding' the animal. But when they arrived, the culprit had disappeared. However, a quick-thinking onlooker . managed to take photographs of the woman's joy ride. After the photos of were released by the Pinellas County Sheriff's Department, the 52-year-old Gutierrez turned herself in yesterday. She reportedly claimed that she was new in town and did not know she had done anything wrong. Florida's Manatee Sanctuary Act forbids 'activities may not, either intentionally or negligently, molest, harass, collide with, injure or harm manatees.' On the run: When Pinellas County Sheriff's deputies arrived at the scene, the woman, pictured, had disappeared . Illegal: Under Florida law, it is illegal to 'annoy, molest, harass, or disturb or attempt to molest, harass, or disturb any manatee' Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said the manatee-molestation was 'outrageous' and warned people to leave the animals alone. 'This is manatee mating season and there are a lot of manatees around but people need to just leave them alone and not molest them and certainly not try to ride them,' he said during a news conference. 'It's pretty outrageous when somebody does that.' But the sheriff's office told the Orlando Sun-Sentinel that she was not arrested because the crime did not take place in a deputyâ€™s presence. Deputies told the paper that charges would be referred to the Florida State Attorney's Office. Manatee: A manatee, pictured, is a large, herbivorous aquatic mammal also known as a sea cow (stock photo) 'It's clear from the photographs that's what she was doing,' Gualtieri added. 'We are asking for the public's help in identifying this woman so that the deputies can place the appropriate criminal charges against her.' The unlucky sea cow wasn't believed to have been hurt in the incident. But the woman, if caught, will likely face a second degree misdemeanor charge for disturbing the mammal and possibly even prison time.

chatgpt: In a surprising turn of events, a woman who had been sought by authorities for weeks has finally turned herself in. Ana Gloria Garcia Gutierrez, 52, was wanted in connection with a hit and run accident that occurred in the small town of Millersville.  Garcia Gutierrez, who had been living in Millersville for only a short time, reportedly told authorities that she was not aware of the laws regarding hit-and-run accidents in the area. She claimed that she had never been involved in a car accident before and did not understand the seriousness of the situation.

They believe that she is genuinely remorseful and is cooperating fully with the investigation. The hit-and-run accident that Garcia Gutierrez was wanted for occurred on a quiet residential street in Millersville on a Sunday afternoon. Witnesses reported seeing a car collide with a pedestrian and then flee the scene. The victim, a 65-year-old man, was rushed to the hospital with serious injuries. After the accident, authorities launched a search for the driver of the car, which they identified as a white SUV.
