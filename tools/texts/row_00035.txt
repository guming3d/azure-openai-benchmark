chatgpt: Last week, 10 people fell ill after an incident at the McDonald's location in Pooler, Georgia. Among those affected was Anne Felton, who was enjoying a meal at the fast-food restaurant when the incident occurred. According to reports, the incident was caused by a leaky gas line, which allowed gas to build up in the restaurant. Unfortunately, this led to 10 people falling ill, including Felton. The incident occurred at around dinner time, and there were approximately 30 people in the restaurant at the time. Witnesses reported a strong smell of gas, and many people began to feel sick. Emergency services were called to the scene, and the restaurant was immediately evacuated. Felton and the other affected individuals were taken to a nearby hospital for treatment. Fortunately, all of the individuals affected by the incident are expected to make a full recovery. However, the incident has raised questions about safety measures at the fast-food restaurant. The McDonald's location in Pooler has issued a statement regarding the incident, expressing their concern for those affected and confirming that they are conducting an investigation to determine what caused the gas leak. "We are deeply concerned about the incident that occurred at our Pooler location last week," the statement read. "We are working closely with authorities to determine the cause of the gas leak, and we are committed to taking all necessary measures to ensure that our customers and employees are safe." The incident has also sparked conversations about the dangers of gas leaks and the importance of being aware of the warning signs. Experts recommend that individuals take steps to protect themselves by installing gas detectors in their homes and workplaces, and by being aware of the symptoms of gas poisoning, which can include headaches, nausea, dizziness, and confusion. For Anne Felton and the other nine individuals affected by the incident at McDonald's, the road to recovery is expected to be a lengthy one. However, with proper care and attention, they should all make a full recovery and be able to return to their daily lives. In the meantime, local authorities and McDonald's officials continue to investigate the cause of the gas leak, and are working to ensure that such an incident does not occur again in the future.
