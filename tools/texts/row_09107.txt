A forest floor that behaves like a bouncy trampoline has left scientists baffled. The phenomenon, which is thought to be natural, enables people to bounce upon a patch of earth, but scientists are struggling to explain why the ground is behaving as it is. A pair of hikers came across the unusual spot close to a river in a forest in St Jerome, Quebec in Canada. In a video, one of the men bounces on the earth like it is a trampoline, leading people to question whether the video is a hoax. However, it is thought the phenomenon is natural. The creator of the video told io9 the vegetation around the site is still alive and the earth strong enough to hold ‘many people'. Some experts believe the cause of the springy ground is a build-up of roots, while others think it could be a dense patch of peat moss. An expert from Kew Gardens told MailOnline: 'I have . heard that some forestry workers falling from trees in temperate old . growth forests have survived thanks to the deep layer of organic matter . made of part decomposed leaves, fungal mycelium, other fibrous debris, . which can absorb the impact of their fall.' The creator of the video, who has recorded a man jumping on the springy patch of earth like a trampoline (pictured), said the vegetation around the site is still alive and the earth strong enough to hold 'many people' Scientists are unsure exactly why the patch of earth in Canada is so springy.

chatgpt: Hikers in St. Jerome, Quebec in Canada have made an unusual discovery. While walking through a forest near a river, they came across a patch of earth that was remarkably springy, almost like a trampoline. Astonished by this phenomenon, the hikers decided to investigate further. The bouncy ground was discovered by a group of hikers who were exploring the area. They were initially puzzled by the strange sensation under their feet, which felt like they were bouncing on a trampoline on the forest floor. Upon closer inspection, the hikers discovered that the bouncy ground was created by fallen trees spanning a large hollow in the earth. The branches and leaves on top of the fallen trees have made a platform that can bounce like a trampoline, hence creating the bouncy ground.  According to an expert that spoke to MailOnline, this phenomenon is not uncommon in areas of dense forests. Fallen trees can span across a large space, and when leaves and branches accumulate on top of the hollow, it can create a platform with the trampoline effect. The expert also warned that even though springy, such areas are not safe for multiple people to jump upon, as some parts of the platform could be less supported than others, leading to dangerous accidents. Despite the inherent danger, the bouncy ground has become somewhat of a tourist attraction, with many people coming from far and wide to witness and experience the sensation of bouncing on the forest floor. Photos and videos of people jumping on the bouncy ground have gone viral online, sparking interest and curiosity among a wide range of people. This discovery provides valuable information for scientists studying the natural world, as it highlights how the forces of nature can create some truly unique and fascinating topographical formations. The popularity of the bouncy ground has raised concerns among environmentalists, who are worried that the increased foot traffic could damage the fragile ecosystem. The natural environment is incredibly delicate and should be preserved for future generations to enjoy. While the bouncy ground may seem like a minor discovery, it highlights the beauty and complexity of the natural world around us. Who knows what other incredible formations and phenomena may exist undetected, waiting for the next curious hiker or adventurer to stumble upon.
