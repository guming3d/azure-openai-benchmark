chatgpt: Arsenal fans have been eagerly waiting for the club to find defensive cover after the departure of Thomas Vermaelen to Barcelona. Now, reports suggest that Arsene Wenger may target the Greek defender Kostas Manolas for a fee of £6.5m. Manolas was surprisingly left out of Olympiakos' squad for their first league match of the season against Niki Volou. This sparked rumors of a possible move away from the Greek club. Arsenal's draw against Everton on Saturday highlighted the need for defensive reinforcements. The Gunners conceded two goals due to a lack of depth in their backline. However, Wenger made it clear that he would only bring in new players if they could strengthen the squad. Manolas would add much-needed depth to Arsenal's defense, which is currently comprised of Per Mertesacker, Laurent Koscielny, and Calum Chambers. The Greek defender played every minute of Greece's World Cup campaign in Brazil, where they reached the Round of 16. The addition of Manolas would bring competition for places, which could only benefit Arsenal. The Greek international's defensive abilities are highly renowned, and his physical presence would be valuable in the Premier League. It is believed that discussions are ongoing between Arsenal and Olympiakos, and a deal could soon be reached. Manolas is a highly sought-after player, with other clubs also rumored to be interested in his services. Arsenal fans will be hoping that the Gunners can secure Manolas' signature before the end of the transfer window. With the new Premier League season underway, time is running out for Wenger to add to his squad. Overall, the arrival of Kostas Manolas would be a significant addition to Arsenal's squad, adding depth and competition to their defense. The Gunners' faithful will be eagerly watching to see if the reported transfer comes to fruition.
