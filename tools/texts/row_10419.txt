article: (CNN) -- The leader of a group representing 9/11 victims' families on Friday criticized the National September 11 Memorial Museum's decision to charge a $24 admission for visitors when it opens this spring. "It was never intended to be a revenue-generating tourist attraction with a prohibitive budget and entrance fee," Sally Regenhard, assistant chairwoman of the group 9/11 Parents and Families of Firefighters and World Trade Center Victims, said in a prepared statement. She calls on government officials "to stop this outrageous fee and bring costs under control." "The rich will visit the museum, but the poor and middle-class families won't be able to afford it," she said. But the ticket price, which was approved Thursday, will "ensure the organization's financial health" and "help fund the necessary operational costs," said a statement from Joe Daniels, the 9/11 memorial president. And the fee will help balance a $63 million operating budget for 2014, said Anthony Guido, communications manager at the 9/11 memorial. "The 9/11 Memorial does not yet receive government support for ongoing operations as many other important museums of our national history do," Daniels said. The memorial is seeking federal funding which would enable the expansion of education programming, Guido said. Relatives of 9/11 victims are exempt from all fees and charges. Discounts will be offered to students, seniors and other groups, and the museum will offer free general admission between 5 and 8 p.m. each Tuesday. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio spoke out against charging an admission fee Wednesday. "This is a nationally important site. It's something that people come to from all over the country, all over the world, and we need the federal government to join with us," he said. The underground museum at the World Trade Center is scheduled to open in mid-May. The above-ground memorial plaza, which has had 11.5 million visitors since opening two years ago, will continue to be free. The memorial preserves the history of September 11, 2001. "The stories and the lives of the nearly 3,000 innocent people lost that day will be forever honored at the Museum through artifacts, exhibitions and first-person accounts," Daniels said. CNN's Lorenzo Ferrigno contributed to this report.

chatgpt: The National September 11 Memorial Museum will begin charging visitors $24 for admission, 9/11 Memorial President Joe Daniels announced. The fee is necessary to help balance the museum's $63 million operating budget. Despite being a national memorial, the museum does not receive any government funding. With annual operating costs ranging between $50 million and $60 million, the museum had been forced to rely on donations to keep its doors open. Daniels explained that the museum's funding structure is unique because it was built largely with private donations, and its operating budget is entirely funded by the museum itself. He said that the admission fee is crucial to keeping the museum running, ensuring that it will be preserved for future generations to see and experience. However, the museum plans to offer discounts and exemptions to help ensure that everyone has access to the museum. Relatives of 9/11 victims, for example, will not have to pay the admission fee. Other discounts will be available, including free admission for active-duty military personnel. There will also be special accommodations for school groups and other organizations. The museum's website explains that it offers a variety of programs and resources for educators, including lesson plans and information on how to plan a visit. The decision to charge admission has been controversial, with some critics arguing that it's inappropriate to charge people to visit a memorial. Others argue that the fee is necessary to maintain the museum and ensure it continues to be a world-class destination for visitors from around the world. "Visiting the 9/11 Memorial Museum is a powerful and emotional experience, and we want to ensure that everyone who wants to visit can do so," Daniels said. "We believe that by offering discounts and exemptions, we can make the museum accessible to everyone while also ensuring that we can continue to maintain and improve this important memorial."  The museum has already attracted millions of visitors since it opened in May 2014. It features exhibits that tell the story of the World Trade Center attacks and the aftermath, including artifacts such as steel beams from the Twin Towers and personal items recovered from the site. The museum also includes a section dedicated to the victims of the attacks and their families, as well as an education center and commemorative art installations.
