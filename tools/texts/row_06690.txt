article: Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli President Shimon Peres committed themselves to the quest for peace Sunday during a meeting of key figures in the Middle East peace process. But unlike previous attempts to achieve a resolution to the region's turmoil through traditional means, there would be no negotiating nor any political talks at Sunday's summit. This appeal would be made to a higher calling: Abbas and Peres prayed for peace together Sunday at the Vatican home of Pope Francis. The meeting comes two weeks after the Pope invited the two leaders to do so during his visit to the Holy Land. "In this, the birthplace of the Prince of Peace" the Pope said in Bethlehem's Manger Square following a May 25 Mass, " I wish to invite you, President Mahmoud Abbas, together with President Shimon Peres, to join me in heartfelt prayer to God for the gift of peace." Sunday's meeting was a first for the Vatican, which had never hosted a prayer gathering of two leaders engaged in conflict. However pious the agenda, the day wasn't totally free of political subtext. After prayers read in Arabic, Hebrew and Italian by figures from different religions, each leader offered his own invocation. "Without peace, we are not complete. We have yet to achieve this mission of humanity," Peres said. "Even when peace seems distant, we must pursue it to bring it closer." "We ask you, Lord, for peace in the Holy Land, Palestine and Jerusalem," said Abbas, according to a CNN translator. "Together with its people, we call on you to make Palestine and Jerusalem, in particular, a secure land for all believers, a place of prayer and worship." The Pope said the meeting is the response to people who want to live as brothers and sisters and not as enemies. "I hope that this meeting will be a journey toward what joins us, to overcome what divides us," Francis said. The groundbreaking meeting -- which was the result of the Pope offering an olive branch two weeks ago -- concluded with the two men exchanging kisses on the cheek before they broke ground themselves for the planting of an olive tree. Only time will tell if today's prayers will go answered. "The metric that Pope Francis would be using to measure the success of this event is much longer term. I don't think anyone is expecting an immediate result," said CNN senior Vatican analyst John L. Allen Jr. "Now that said, you could also argue that the success of tonight could be measured by the simple fact that it happened."

chatgpt: The leaders of Israel and Palestine met in Vatican City on Sunday for a prayer meeting with Pope Francis. The event, which followed the pope's surprise invitation to the two leaders in May, was intended to promote peace between the two warring nations. During the meeting, Pope Francis called on the Israeli and Palestinian leaders to set aside their differences and stop seeing each other as enemies. He emphasized that "the way of peace requires patience, dialogue, and a willingness to be open to each other." The Israeli President Shimon Peres echoed the pope's sentiments and emphasized the importance of pursuing peace, even when it seemed distant. "We must pursue peace, no matter how far away it may seem," he said. "We cannot give up on it, no matter how much effort it requires." Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, meanwhile, called for divine intervention to bring peace to the region. "We pray to God for peace and security in the Holy Land," he said. The prayer meeting was an unprecedented event for these leaders, who have been at odds for decades. The Vatican has long been involved in peace initiatives between Israel and Palestine, but this was the first time that the pope invited the two leaders to pray together. The event was seen as a symbolic act of reconciliation and a sign of hope for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. The pope, who recently visited the Holy Land, has made peace a top priority of his papacy. He has called on Israelis and Palestinians to recognize each other's rights and to work together to end the violence and hostility that has plagued the region for decades. The meeting was not without controversy, however. The Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, did not attend the prayer meeting, citing scheduling conflicts. In addition, some criticized the event as a mere photo-op, arguing that it would not lead to substantive change. Despite the criticisms, the prayer meeting was a rare moment of unity and peaceful discourse in a conflict-ridden region. It demonstrated the power of faith and prayer to bring people together and to promote understanding and compassion. It also served as a reminder that peace is possible, even in the most challenging of circumstances.
