article: Designers from Dolce & Gabbana to Ghost have sent dresses reminiscent of nightwear down the catwalk, and some stars have even worn nighties out on the town. So was Loose Women presenter Andrea McLean, 45, able to tell dress from nightie? 1. This must be a dress — it has lining, a zip and smoothed over all my lumps and bumps. It was comfortable and I would happily wear it to dinner with a simple three-quarter-length jacket. When I found it was a nightie, I was shocked. I’d feel very overdressed if I wore this in bed. Nightdress, Agent Provocateur, £295, harrods.com; heels, £65, office.co.uk . 2. A nightie if ever I saw one! I wouldn’t be brave enough to wear it out and about, because the colour is so unforgiving. The cut would only work for the very brave: one twirl on the dancefloor and everyone would see every bit of my tummy. So imagine my surprise when I discovered it was actually a dress!

It felt secure, comfortable and I’d happily go out for a meal in it. It’s not my usual style, but is surprisingly flattering. Also, unlike a real nightie, which is usually lighter and gathers around all the bits you don’t want it to, this is weighty so hangs off my curves well. My favourite.

I love the colour, the fit and the shawl back, and it slims in all the right places. I felt a little bit exposed, though, and I’m really not sure I’d be confident enough to wear it in public. It’s elegant and looks like a dress from the back. With the right underwear, it could look lovely. Silk chemise, £95, figleaves.com; glitter heels, £195, lucychoilondon.com . 5. I expected to be surprised by this one, but due to the lining I decided it was almost certainly a dress — and I was right. It felt very soft and the material was gorgeous — it also had lots of movement, which I love. And, unlike the others, I wouldn’t need a bra, thanks to its internal boning. This was my second favourite: I felt dressed-up and sophisticated. Dress, £225, ghost.co.uk .

chatgpt: Slink, lace-edged dresses have been making a splash on the fashion scene this year. They have been showcased on catwalks around the world and have even been daringly worn by some celebrities out on the town. But can the average person tell the difference between an elegant evening dress and a piece of alluring nightwear? Andrea McLean, co-presenter of the popular UK daytime show Loose Women, put her skills to the test with FEMAIL to find out. McLean, who is well known for her fashion sense, was given a range of garments to assess. She was initially shown a selection of evening dresses, ranging from floor-length gowns to shorter cocktail numbers. With her trained eye, she was quick to spot the details that set these pieces apart from other styles of dress. She commented on the quality of the fabric, the way it draped on the body and the intricate details of the embroidery and beading. But the real challenge came when McLean was shown a range of slink, lace-edged nightwear. These pieces were certainly eye-catching, with their delicate lace and sheer fabrics. McLean was tasked with deciding whether they were intended to be worn in the bedroom or if they could be styled into a fashionable outfit for a night out. At first, the task seemed easy. McLean was able to correctly identify a few of the more distinct pieces as nightwear. However, as the garments became more elaborate and luxurious, the lines began to blur. McLean found herself struggling to confidently decide whether a garment was lingerie or a dress. There were times when she would admit that only by looking at the label on the back of the garment could she be sure. Overall, the challenge demonstrated the difficulty in differentiating between these two types of garments. With the current trend of daring styles that blur the lines between nightwear and dresses, it is becoming increasingly challenging to identify what category a piece of clothing falls into. McLean acknowledged that while there may not be a definitive answer, it ultimately comes down to personal preference and perception. Whether someone chooses to style a slink, lace-edged garment as an evening dress or nightwear is up to them. What was clear from the challenge was that the slinky, feminine styles of these garments are certainly making an impact on the fashion world. In conclusion, the popularity of slink, lace-edged garments this year is undeniable. From the catwalks to celebrities to the everyday person, these pieces have captured the attention of the fashion world. The challenge of differentiating between nightwear and dresses is a testament to the innovative and daring styles that are currently in vogue. As McLean noted, personal preference and creative styling is key when it comes to these types of garments.
