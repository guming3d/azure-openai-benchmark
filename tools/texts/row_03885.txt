article: Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- Dozens of people were injured in Bangladesh as riot police clashed with thousands of Islamists protesting women's rights, authorities and witnesses said. The protesters damaged buses and cars Monday, setting several on fire, while police used clubs and tear gas to disperse the Islamists, who were wearing skullcaps and burial cloths. "We'll die for the cause of Islam, but (will) not allow the government to disrespect (the) Quran," one protester shouted during the demonstration near the national mosque in downtown Dhaka. The government recently announced its National Women Development Policy 2011, which ensures women expanded rights in property and education. The protesters said the policy is against the Quran. Fazlul Huq Amini, leader of a coalition of Islamic groups called the Islami Oikya Jote, asked his followers to take to the streets to protest the policy. Amini said the Quran defines how much property a woman should inherit, and the government should not allow women more than that. "It's against the principle of the Quran, and we'll resist it at any cost," Amini said. Thousands of students in madrassas, or Islamic schools, carried sticks and logs as they marched the streets. Protests also took place in the southern port city of Chittagong and several other areas. Business activities ceased, and schools remained closed because of fears of violence. "We had sufficient security measures to avert any violent incidents," said Benazir Ahmed, Dhaka's police chief. The government said it had done nothing against the Quran. "Amini is misleading the people," said government spokesman Mohammad Shahjahan Miah. Earlier on Monday, a madrassa student was shot to death in western Jessore district when police opened fire on the protesters. Amini, a former lawmaker, said the protests will continue until the policy is scrapped. The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party lent support to the protests.

chatgpt: Dozens of people have been reported injured in Bangladesh as riot police clashed with protesters who opposed the expanded rights in property and education. The demonstrations took place in various cities across the country, including the southern port city of Chittagong. The protesters took to streets, expressing their discontent over the supposed government move to expand the rights of women in property and education. However, the government denied any such action and maintained that it has not acted against the principles of the Quran. Nonetheless, the protesters were not convinced and continued to demonstrate for their cause. In Dhaka, the capital of the country, the police had to use tear gas and water cannons to disperse the crowds, leading to chaos and widespread violence. The situation worsened as the protesters threw stones and lit fires in the streets, leading the police to take a harsher stance. Similar scenes were reported from Chittagong and other cities as well. According to eyewitnesses, the protesters were mostly students and young people who took to the streets to voice their opposition to the supposed government action. They believe that the expansion of women's rights in property and education goes against the traditional Islamic values of the country. The clashes between the police and the protesters have resulted in several injuries on both sides. Dozens of people were reported injured, with some of them being critical. The authorities have warned the protesters to maintain peace and order, and to refrain from violence. The situation in Bangladesh is tense, with the government trying to assure the people that it has not acted against the Quran and the protesters continuing to demand their rights. The expanded rights in education and property for women have been a contentious issue in the country for a while now, and it remains to be seen how the situation will develop in the coming days.
