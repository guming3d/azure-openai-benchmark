article: (CNN) -- Guinea international Lass Bangoura pulled out of a key African Cup of Nations match against Ghana Saturday because his club teammates were worried he could contract Ebola. Bangoura, who plays for Rayo Vallecano in Spain, told the La Liga side's official website that he had been told of their fears in a phone call while training for the Group E qualifier. With Guinea one of the worst affected countries by the deadly virus, the international match had already been moved to the Moroccan city of Casablanca, but that apparently did not satisfy his fellow Rayo squad members. "My teammates were afraid and at the end of practice I spoke with the (Guinea) coach Michel Dussuyer and said there was a problem, because of Ebola. "I asked him if I could be excused because I didn't want any problems with the club, because they are the ones who pay my salary," he said. Bangoura has now returned to his club, who are based in the Spanish capital Madrid where earlier this week a nurse became the first person in Europe to contract Ebola outside of West Africa. She remains critically ill in hospital. "My Rayo teammates welcomed me back," Bangoura said. "They have confidence in me, but what people need to understand is that when you are summoned for the national team, you have to see a doctor and get tested. "Every national team has its own doctor who takes care of these issues. I am fine, there is no problem (with my health)," he added. The 22-year-old Bangoura is a regular in the Rayo first team and has also established himself in his national squad. He was concerned that his withdrawal could lead to problems for his family back home in Guinea. "I just spoke to my mother, we have been talking. It is the first time I have left the national team and I am scared that there could be some crazy person who harms my family. "This afternoon I'll be speaking on my country's radio to say I have no issue with the national team and to say I'm sorry." The spread of the Ebola virus has had a serious impact on football in affected countries, with all competitive games stopped in Sierra Leona. African Cup of Nations qualifiers involving its national team, Guinea and Liberia have also been relocated by the Confederation of African Football.

chatgpt: Guinea's national team suffered a blow as its star midfielder, Alhassane "Lass" Bangoura, withdrew from the squad ahead of crucial matches against Ghana. Bangoura cited concerns over the Ebola virus as the reason for his withdrawal, particularly concerns from his club teammates at Rayo Vallecano in Spain.  The Guinean Football Federation announced the withdrawal of Bangoura, who had been expected to play a key role in upcoming matches against Ghana. Guinea is due to play Ghana in Morocco in a two-legged playoff to determine which team will qualify for the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations to be held in Equatorial Guinea. Despite the withdrawal, Bangoura maintained that he was in good health. “I am fine,” he said when asked about his health. The player expressed his regret at not being able to represent his country at this critical time, but noted that he has to "respect the fear" of his club teammates. Rayo Vallecano had previously expressed its concerns about allowing Bangoura to travel to Guinea to play for the national team. The club said that it would have been willing to let Bangoura play with the team, but raised the issue about the possible transmission of the Ebola virus, which has been ravaging West Africa. The Ebola virus, which is transmitted through the contact of bodily fluids, has already claimed the lives of thousands of people in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea. There are fears that the virus could spread outside of West Africa, particularly through air travel. Guinea has been hit particularly hard by the Ebola outbreak, with the country having reported over 2,000 cases of the virus as of November 2014. The government has imposed strict measures to try to stop the spread of the virus, including the banning of public gatherings, the closure of schools and universities, and the quarantine of affected areas. Despite the challenges, the national team is determined to continue with its preparations for the crucial matches against Ghana. Guinea's coach, Michel Dussuyer, has said that the team is deeply saddened by Bangoura's absence, but that it is trying to focus on the task at hand. The Guinean government has also announced that it will do everything possible to ensure the team's safety during its stay in Morocco. It has said that it has put in place measures to make sure that the team receives the medical attention and support it needs, particularly in light of the Ebola crisis. The injury of Bangoura from the Guinean national team is seen as a serious setback, as the midfielder is considered one of the key players in the team. Nevertheless, the team is expected to put up a strong fight against Ghana and try to overcome the odds to qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations.
