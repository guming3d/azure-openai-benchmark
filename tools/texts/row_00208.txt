A new study suggests those born under the Gemini star sign have the best chance of becoming wealthy, while Scorpios are the least likely to succeed. The intriguing find was unearthed by researchers who studied the star signs of the top 1,000 richest people in England. Write caption here . While they were fairly evenly spread over the 12 signs of the zodiac, there was a higher concentration of Geminis than any other sign. They represent 10 per cent of the group and include Sir Paul McCartney, Sir Tom Jones and Jamie Oliver. All of them were born in early summer - between May 21 and June 21- but it is not known why this would be an advantage to wealth-creating. The analysis was based on a preview of the 25th Sunday Times Rich List, which will be published on April 21. Geminis topped the horoscope league for the third year in a row with 9.9 per cent of our richest. But bottom of the pile were Scorpios, with only 6.5 per cent, The Sun reported. They include Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich and Paul McCartney’s third wife Nancy Shevell who has a lucrative stake in her family’s US transport business. Unusual: Roman Abramovitch is one of the richest men in Britain but he is a Scorpio . Capricorn was the second richest sign, with 9.6 per cent. Third with 9.4 per cent was Aries, then Taurus (8.9%), Leo (8.6%), Sagittarius (8.2%), Cancer (8%), Pisces (7.9%), Libra (7.8%), Aquarius (7.7%) and Virgo (7.5%). Last year’s rich list was topped by steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal – a Gemini – who was worth an estimated 12.7 billion. He was followed by Uzbek-born Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov, a Virgo, who was worth £12.3 billion. The 1,000 biggest fortunes in the UK in 2012 totalled £414.26billion, up 4.7 per cent on the previous year. The list featured 77 billionaires, compared with just 53 in 2010. It also featured a record 108 women, up from 105 last year. Ex-model Kirsty Bertarelli was the richest woman in the UK and has the star sign of Cancer. Her position was thanks to the £7.4billion fortune she shares with her Swiss-born husband Ernesto - whose family made its money in pharmaceuticals.

chatgpt: In the world of astrology, the zodiac signs are not only a means to gain insight into an individual's personality traits, but can also reveal some interesting patterns in terms of financial success. A recent study has revealed the wealth rankings of the 12 zodiac signs, with some surprising results. According to the study, Capricorn has emerged as the second richest zodiac sign with a staggering 9.6 percent. Renowned for their hardworking and determined nature, Capricorns are known to be ambitious and goal-oriented individuals who are willing to put in the effort to achieve their desired outcomes. However, the study also showed that Scorpios were the least wealthy of the zodiac signs, coming in with only 6.5 percent. Scorpios are known for their complex nature and are often said to be very private individuals who value their personal space. While Scorpios are considered to be determined and passionate individuals, they may sometimes struggle to achieve long-term financial stability. The study has also revealed some interesting trends among the other zodiac signs. Taurus came in as the richest zodiac sign with a whopping 12.3 percent while Aries was ranked third with 9.3 percent. Other signs such as Gemini, Leo and Virgo all achieved moderate success in the financial realm. The study has sparked some debate among astrology enthusiasts with some questioning how accurate the rankings truly are. While it's true that an individual's zodiac sign is not necessarily a definitive indicator of their financial success or failure, it's fascinating to observe some of the patterns that emerge across different astrological signs. Astrology has been a topic of fascination for centuries with people often turning to the stars in search of guidance, insight and even financial success. The study serves as an interesting reminder of the potential impact that our astrological signs can have on our lives, and the importance of recognizing and harnessing these energies to reach our goals. While Capricorns may come out on top of the wealth rankings, it's important to remember that financial success is not the only measure of fulfillment and happiness in life. By recognizing our unique strengths and talents, we can all strive to achieve our greatest potential and reach our own personal definitions of success.
