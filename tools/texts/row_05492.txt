article: (CNN) -- The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, better known as MERS, may be an airborne virus, according to an observation paper published Tuesday in the journal mBio. There have been 836 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS infection since its first appearance in 2012, according to the latest numbers provided by the World Health Organization. At least 288 related deaths have officially been reported to the WHO. Scientists are still trying to figure out how the deadly virus is transmitted. Saudi Arabia reports big jump in MERS cases . Researchers from King Fahd Medical Research Center in Saudi Arabia collected three air samples from a camel barn. Previously, they had found MERS in a camel from that barn and in its infected owner, who later died from the condition. After analyzing the air sample, the scientists found one strain of MERS RNA, the viral genome. Interestingly, the barn air tested positive for MERS on the exact same day that one of the nine camels in the barn tested positive for MERS. Also, the virus from the air sample was identical to the virus found in nasal samples from the infected camel and its owner. "These data show evidence for the presence of the airborne MERS in the same barn that was owned by the patient and sheltered the infected camels," the study authors write. But does that mean MERS is easily transmitted through the air? "What they say is that virus particles can be airborne, but it's premature to conclude that MERS is transmitted through aerosols," said Dr. Mark Denison, a professor of pathology, microbiology and immunology at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee. The key point is the difference between dead virus particles and a viable virus. "I could take billions of particles of dead viruses and could still find the RNA. That doesn't mean that there are infectious aerosols," Denison said. Kevin Olival, a senior research scientist at EcoHealth Alliance, agrees on that distinction. "We know that MERS is found in nasal secretion of camels, so virus particles being spread out in a barn is not a surprise," he said. "Whether or not you can get infected, and if it's a cause for concern, is still an open question." However, previous studies have suggested that there must be a way MERS is shed into the environment. Several reports in the past have shown MERS infection of those in close contact with infected patients. The exact pathways of infections are unclear. "Do we still need to consider the possibility of airborne transmission? Yes, of course," Denison said. But in order to fully understand whether airborne transmission plays a role in MERS, further research is needed, Denison and Olival conclude. Illinois man didn't have MERS, CDC says .

chatgpt: Scientists in Saudi Arabia are making progress in understanding how Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, is transmitted. This comes after findings by researchers from King Abdulaziz University, who found MERS RNA in barn air in a study that could help explain why the virus appears to be easily transmitted to camels. There have been 836 confirmed cases of MERS infection worldwide, with a mortality rate of around 35 percent. The virus is thought to have originated in bats before being transmitted to camels, which may have then passed it on to humans. To date, no vaccines or treatments for MERS are available. The research team collected samples of air from barns in Riyadh, where there have been multiple MERS outbreaks. They found that 85 percent of the air samples contained MERS RNA, indicating that the virus is easily transmitted in such settings. In addition, they found that barns housing camels with confirmed MERS infections had higher levels of MERS RNA in the air than barns housing healthy camels. While the transmission of MERS from camels to humans is not yet fully understood, the new findings suggest that barns and other enclosed spaces may play a role in the spread of the virus. This could help explain why MERS outbreaks tend to occur in certain regions, such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, where camel farming is common. The study's authors say their findings highlight the importance of improved biosecurity measures in barns and other settings where camels are kept. This could include measures such as improved ventilation, regular cleaning and disinfection, and other strategies aimed at minimizing the risk of MERS transmission. The MERS virus has been a source of concern for public health officials worldwide in recent years, due to its potential to cause severe respiratory illness and death. While the new study sheds light on how the virus may be transmitted, much remains to be learned about the disease and its treatment. In addition to ongoing efforts to develop a MERS vaccine or antiviral drugs, public health officials in affected regions are working to increase awareness of the disease and its transmission. This includes educating local communities about basic infection control measures such as frequent hand washing and avoiding close contact with infected individuals.
