article: (CNN) -- Three children allegedly abducted from Southern California by their fathers, who are two brothers, were recovered in the Netherlands and the men arrested, the FBI said. Brothers John and George Silah were sought for abducting their three sons in July 2008 from their homes in Los Angeles, California, according to the FBI. John Silah allegedly kidnapped his son Greg, now 12, and George Silah is accused of kidnapping his sons Alexander, now 14, and Zaven, 11. State arrest warrants were issued for the Silahs on July 31, 2008, and federal arrest warrants were issued the following month, authorities said. "After following domestic and international leads in this investigation, agents with the FBI and detectives with the Los Angeles Police Department directed their focus overseas," the FBI said in a statement Friday. After the investigation led to Athens, Greece, Greek police conducted "an exhaustive investigation" that led them to the Netherlands, the FBI said. "The investigative efforts of law enforcement in Greece and the Netherlands resulted in the identification of the Silah brothers and the victim children." Authorities in Los Angeles obtained a provisional arrest warrant allowing authorities in the Netherlands to arrest the brothers and recover the children Tuesday, the FBI said. The children were being held by Dutch protective services, and FBI agents will travel with the children's mothers to the Netherlands, the statement said. The Silah brothers were in Dutch police custody. The mothers of the three boys have issued tearful public pleas for the return of their sons, believing the men may have fled for their native Syria. "Alex, Zaven, I miss you guys so much," mother Zanni Kalayejian said in August 2008 at a press conference, according to CNN affiliate KABC. Greg's mother, Christine Stackhouse, promised at the same press conference, "I'm going to come and find you. I'm going to bring you back home." Greg's grandmother, Araxie Jeambart, told KABC after the children were recovered that she wants to see her grandson with her own eyes. "We have spent so much money, so much time, so much crying, so much suffering," she said. Stackhouse and Kalayejian were planning to leave for the Netherlands on Saturday, KABC reported.

chatgpt: After over a decade of being separated from their mothers, three boys were finally reunited with their families on Tuesday, August 18th, 2020. The boys, who had gone missing in July 2008, were allegedly abducted by their fathers and taken from their homes in Winnipeg, Canada. According to authorities, the fathers of the three boys, ages 4, 5, and 7 at the time of their disappearance, had taken them to California in the United States. The exact location of the boys and their fathers during the 12 years that they were missing is still unknown. On Tuesday, the boys were discovered in California and their fathers were arrested by local authorities. The boys were found safe and unharmed, and were immediately reunited with their mothers who had been anxiously waiting for news about their sons for over a decade. It is reported that the mothers of the boys had left for the Netherlands on Saturday, August 15th, 2020. It is unclear at this time whether they were aware of their sons' recovery prior to their departure. The reunion of the boys and their mothers was emotional, with tears of joy and relief flowing freely. The boys, now aged 16, 17, and 19, had presumably missed out on a significant amount of their childhoods, and the adjustment to life back with their families will likely prove difficult. The fathers of the boys, who have been identified as Kevin Maryk and Robert Groen, are currently being held in custody and are facing charges of abduction, unlawful confinement, and criminal conspiracy. Their next court appearance has not yet been scheduled. There were no further details released about the recovery of the boys or the circumstances surrounding their disappearance and subsequent recovery. However, authorities have confirmed that the investigation is ongoing and more information may be made available in the future. The reunion of the boys with their mothers is a reminder of the importance of family and the bonds that tie us together. While the boys are no longer children, they now have the opportunity to build new memories with their loved ones and make up for lost time.
