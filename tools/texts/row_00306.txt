article: MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- The driver of a fire truck died Thursday while racing to fight a raging forest fire in eastern Spain, the fifth fatality among firefighters this week, authorities said. A firefighter walks around the area where a fire burns in Andorra early on July 23, near Teruel. The 44-year-old firefighter died while heading toward a fire in Teruel province, the regional Aragon government said on its Web site. Four firefighters died Tuesday while battling a forest fire in the eastern Catalonia region, not far from Teruel, CNN partner station CNN+ reported, citing local authorities. Those authorities said the fire, in Horta de Sant Joan in Tarragona province, had been under control at midday Tuesday, but winds revived it, trapping the four firefighters, CNN+ reported. By Thursday, the Catalan fire at Horta de Sant Joan remained out of control, a regional official said, while in neighboring Aragon region, six fires still blazed out of control. Some 8,000 hectares (nearly 20,000 acres) have already burned in Aragon, forcing the evacuation of more than 1,600 people. A dozen other fires in the region have been brought under control, the Aragon government said. Aircraft, including planes and helicopters, were being used in Aragon and Catalonia to battle the fires, along with hundreds of firefighters in the hilly terrain, much of it with difficult access. More than 800 Spanish troops are fighting numerous forest fires across Spain, the Environment Ministry said. Other forest fires in Spain on Wednesday afternoon forced an interruption of service of the bullet train between Madrid and Barcelona, affecting more than 6,000 passengers, the state railway authority said. By Thursday morning, service had been resumed on the route, used by many business travelers. Spain is plagued by forest and brush fires every summer, when extremely dry weather sets in along with high temperatures. In 2005, 11 people were killed when they were trapped by a fast-moving fire in Guadalajara province, east of Madrid. CNN's Al Goodman and Patrick Sung-Cuadrado contributed to this report.

chatgpt: The wildfires that have been ravaging across Spain this summer have been causing widespread destruction and devastation. Despite the best efforts of firefighters who are giving their all to bring the flames under control, the fires continue to rage on, destroying everything in their path. Aircraft are being deployed in Aragon and Catalonia to fight the wildfire as this is seen as the most effective way of bringing the fires under control. These aircraft are equipped with water tanks that help douse the flames with precision from above. This allows firefighters on the ground to get into the thick of the blaze and try to contain it. However, the risks involved in such a dangerous line of work were brought into sharp focus this week when a 44-year-old firefighter tragically lost his life while heading towards a fire in the Teruel province. The news was met with great sadness and grief as the firefighter’s colleagues and loved ones mourned his passing. But this wasn’t the only tragedy that struck the firefighting community in Spain this week. Four firefighters also lost their lives while battling the fires in eastern Catalonia, an area not too far from Teruel. The loss of life has been a stark reminder of the dangers that these brave men and women are facing on a daily basis in their efforts to protect their fellow citizens and tame the fires Spain is plagued by wildfires every year, and the summer months are particularly challenging for emergency services. The country is also known for its dry weather and high temperatures at this time, which can exacerbate the wildfire outbreak. Efforts to contain the fires are ongoing, and the firefighting community is working tirelessly to bring the blazes under control. Despite the difficulties faced, Spain remains committed to protecting its citizens and the natural beauty of its countryside. The loss of life is a tragic reminder of the bravery and devotion of those who put their lives on the line to keep others safe.
