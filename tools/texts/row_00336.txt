article: Apple charges you £15 for a 'Lightning' charger cable for the new iPhone - or £30 for an adapter so that you can use your older accessories. Fans might be hoping they could bypass this additional cost with the help of third-party manufacturers creating cheaper versions of the cables. But it appears Apple has locked down its cables - adding an authentication chip which is likely to stop any other cables working with the £529 device. No entry: Apple appears to employ a chip within the Lightning cable, to stop unauthorised cables being used with the new iPhone . The Double Helix cable team took apart a Lightning cable in order to find the chip inside . Apple has come in for criticism before for shunning the rest of the industry's EU-directed move towards a standard micro-USB connection. And fans were left angry by the move to the Lightning connector which, while smaller and thinner, makes old accessories obsolete without the £30 adapter. The discovery of an authentication chip within the cable was revealed on AppleInsider, a website dedicated to the iPhone manufacturer. The site spoke to 'Peter', from the company Double Helix Cables, who pulled apart the cable which came with the new phone. From his investigation, the site warns iPhone owners not to purchase the cheap third-party Lightning chargers now appearing on eBay and other sites. Peter dismantled the Lightning connector and found what appear to be an authentication chip inside, located directly between the data cable and the power pin. Pricey cable: Apple sells its own propriety adapters on its website for £30 . Break from the past: Apple's senior vice president of marketing Phil Schiller announcing the new lightning port two weeks ago . The new Apple iPhone 5 has had record-breaking sales, selling five million devices in the first weekend . The inclusion of a chip tallies with the reported increase in cost to produce the cable, costing an estimated $3.50 to Apple. AppleInsider said this was a 775 per cent increase on the costs of producing the previous cable. While some of that increase will be down to the new design and economies of scale, the addition of a chip will have sent the production price upwards. Peter said:'There is basically no way those are functional cables. 'You can't just build a Lightning cable by making something with the same shape and connectivity, and my teardown proves that. 'The chip has to be there, and it is directly in the signal path of the V+ wire.' He added that users would not be able to make a cable, or adapt an existing one - 'at least not without a precise dissection of an Apple-branded Lightning cable.'

chatgpt: Apple has released a new firmware update that prevents third-party cables from being used to connect to iPhones. The update affects owners of the iPhone 5 and later models, and prevents unauthorized cables, which are often cheaper than Apple's own products, from being used with the devices. The new update includes a security feature that blocks the use of these unauthorized cables. The security feature is built into an authentication chip, which can tell the difference between an authorized and unauthorized cable. This chip only works with the original Apple Lightning cables, meaning that third-party cables will no longer work. Apple has warned iPhone 5 owners not to purchase cheaper cables, as these cables are not likely to work after installing the firmware update. The company also states that unauthorized cables can damage the device and may cause it to malfunction. Many users have expressed their disappointment over this move by Apple, stating that they are being forced to buy Apple's more expensive cables instead of cheaper third-party alternatives. However, Apple has defended its decision, stating that the unauthorized cables could pose a security risk to the user and device. The decision by Apple to block third-party cables has also sparked concerns among consumer protection groups, who argue that it gives the company a monopoly over the market. The groups claim that by blocking third-party cables, Apple is forcing consumers to pay a premium for its products, rather than being able to choose from a variety of cheaper, and potentially safer, alternatives. Technicians have advised users to purchase the original Apple Lightning cables, as these have been designed to work with the authentication chip in the firmware update. The Apple cables are also backed by a warranty, meaning that users can get a replacement if their cable malfunctions. In conclusion, iPhone 5 and later model users are being advised to steer clear of using unauthorized cables to connect their devices to other devices or charging stations. The new firmware update from Apple blocks third-party cables, which can pose a security risk or cause a malfunction. In the interest of maintaining their devices, users should buy only Apple cables, which have a warranty, thus ensuring their protection in the end.
