chatgpt: Tragedy struck a Long Island family on Wednesday when a bus plowed into their front room, leaving one child pinned against the wall and another covered in cuts from shattered glass. David Granados, only six years old, was trapped against the wall as the bus smashed through the front of their home. His older brother, seven-year-old Michael, was cut by the shards of glass that flew everywhere as the vehicle made impact. A family friend who witnessed the terrifying event described it as "loud and horrifying." There was blood everywhere, and the front of the house was torn down. The incident occurred after the bus lost control when it struck a pedestrian. The driver was reportedly attempting to avoid hitting the pedestrian when the bus went careening into the Granados' home. Several passengers on board the bus were also injured. Emergency responders were quickly on the scene, working frantically to extricate young David from the wall. Eventually, they were able to free him, and he was rushed to the hospital. It is unclear at this point the extent of David's injuries, but he is currently listed as being in critical condition. Michael is also receiving treatment for his injuries but is expected to recover fully. The bus driver has not yet been identified, and it's unclear if any charges will be filed. The incident is still under investigation. Neighbors and community members have rallied around the Granados family, offering support and assistance during this difficult time. Many are calling for increased safety measures around the area, citing similar incidents that have happened in the past. This is not the first time that a vehicle has crashed into a Long Island home - in recent years, there have been several notable incidents. In 2015, an SUV crashed into a home in Valley Stream, killing a mother and injuring her two children. And earlier this year, a car crashed into a home in Lynbrook, causing extensive damage. Some are calling on lawmakers to re-evaluate the regulations surrounding public transportation to prevent similar incidents in the future. Others are urging drivers to exercise caution and remain alert, especially in residential areas. Despite the outpouring of support from the community, the Granados family is still reeling from the shock of what happened. It's a reminder that accidents can happen at any time and that everyone needs to take responsibility for keeping themselves and others safe. As the investigation continues into what caused this tragic incident, our thoughts are with the Granados family and all those affected by this devastating event.
