The Florida State Boxing Commission has been reviewing Fox's license to determine whether she'll be able to keep fighting against women in the CFA's female tournament. Mitrone, who played defensive line in the NFL with the Giants in 2002 and the Vikings in 2005 before switching to fighting, called her a liar because Fox failed to flag up that she was transgender to the commission or her opponents before entering the ring. She has, however, been cleared to fight, the New York Post reported. 'That is a lying, sick, sociopathic, disgusting freak,' Mitrione said on the program. 'And I mean that. Because you lied on your license to beat up women. That's disgusting. You should be embarrassed yourself. And the fact that Florida licensed him because California licensed him or whoever the hell did it, it's an embarrassment to us as fighters, as a sport, and we all should protest that.

'The woman that's fighting him, props to you. I hope you beat his ass, and I hope he gets blackballed and never fights again, because that's disgusting and I'm appalled by that.' In the midst of the tirade, the show's host Ariel Helwani questioned why Mitrione kept calling Fox a 'he.' 'She's not a he. He's a he,' Mitrione argued. 'He's chromosomally a man. He had a gender change, not a sex change. He's still a man. He was a man for 31 years. Thirty-one years. That's a couple years younger than I am. He's a man. Six years of taking performance de-hancing drugs, you think is going to change all that? That's ridiculous.' It took the UFC a matter of hours before they suspended Mitrione until further notice claiming they were 'appalled by the transphobic comments' that were 'offensive and wholly unacceptable.' They also launched an investigation into the remarks.

chatgpt: Controversy has erupted in the mixed martial arts (MMA) world after heavyweight fighter Matt Mitrione made transphobic comments about fellow fighter Fallon Fox on the MMAFighting.com show 'The MMA Hour'. Fox, born a man, underwent hormone therapy and gender reassignment surgery in 2006 to transition to female. However, Mitrione referred to her as a "lying, sick, sociopathic, disgusting freak" during the show, while also stating that he would beat up any transgender fighter. The comments immediately sparked outrage, with the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) denouncing Mitrione's remarks as "unacceptable and offensive" in a statement released on Tuesday. The statement further added that the UFC is "committed to a culture of tolerance, diversity, and respect for all." Fox has been open about her transition and has fought in various MMA promotions, including the UFC. While some have raised concerns about her fighting against women, others argue that her hormone therapy levels meet the specific requirements for an individual in transition to compete in MMA. Nevertheless, Mitrione's comments have drawn widespread criticism from the sporting community and beyond, with many taking to social media to express their disgust. "Matt Mitrione's comments are disgusting and have no place in our sport," said Megan Anderson, a professional MMA fighter. Transgender athletes have faced discrimination in sports for decades, and this incident highlights the urgent need for greater understanding and acceptance. The issue of transgender athletes competing in sports has been a matter of debate, with some arguing that the advantage conferred by male puberty gives trans female athletes an unfair advantage over cisgender women. However, sports authorities have been seeking to address this issue, with the International Olympic Committee introducing guidelines in 2015 stipulating that athletes must maintain a serum testosterone level below a certain threshold for at least 12 months prior to competition. As for Mitrione, he has since apologized for his comments, stating that his words were "hurtful and inappropriate". Nevertheless, the incident serves as a reminder of the ongoing discrimination faced by trans athletes in sports, and the need for greater education and acceptance in the sporting community.  In a statement, Fox said the following: "Itâ€™s unfortunate that Matt Mitrione feels the need to use such hateful language about a member of our community who has done absolutely nothing wrong, especially when the rest of the world is moving forward, becoming more inclusive and accepting." In a world where an individual's gender identity remains a source of significant controversy, it is essential that sports organizations and athletes work towards greater understanding and inclusion for all. Despite setbacks, the fight for acceptance continues, and it is hoped that incidents such as these will serve as a catalyst for change in the world of sports.
