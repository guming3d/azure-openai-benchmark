article: Roberto Mancini was flattened by one of his own players on Sunday as his Inter Milan side continued their resurgence in Serie A with a 3-1 win over Genoa. With the score at 2-0, Genoa tried to unlock Inter's defence with a quick counter attack that was abruptly halted by defender Marco Andreolli.

chatgpt: In a bizarre incident during Inter Milan's 3-1 triumph over Lugano in a preseason friendly, their head coach Roberto Mancini was struck by a clearance from one of his players - Marco Andreolli. The ball cannoned off Andreolli's foot and hit Mancini square in the face, knocking him to the ground. The incident occurred in the closing stages of the match, with Inter already comfortable and heading towards a comfortable win. The match was played behind closed doors at the club's training ground in Appiano Gentile. Despite being taken by surprise, Mancini quickly regained his composure and laughed off the incident. He said after the match, "I didn't see it well, but it's nothing serious, only a bit of pain. Now I'll have a swollen face for a few days."  Mancini even managed to see the funny side of the whole situation when asked about the clearance. "It was a very good shot, but unfortunately not at the goal," he joked. "I think he needs to work on his accuracy." The incident may have overshadowed what was an impressive performance by Inter Milan in their preseason match against Lugano. They took the lead through Mauro Icardi's first-half goal before Stevan Jovetic added a second shortly after the break. Nemanja Vidic, who has struggled for game time since joining Inter last season, scored their third goal with a header from a corner in the 84th minute. It was a positive result for Inter as they gear up for the start of the Serie A season. Mancini's side had a disappointing campaign last year, finishing eighth in the league, but they will be hoping to push for a Champions League place this time around. The incident involving Mancini and Andreolli serves as a reminder that football can be unpredictable at times. It is also a testament to the camaraderie and humor within the Inter Milan camp that Mancini was able to see the funny side of being hit in the face by a football. As the season approaches, Mancini will be hoping that his players can execute their passes and clearances with a bit more accuracy than Andreolli did. However, the incident has not dampened Inter's spirits, and they will be looking to build on their solid preseason performances as they aim to challenge for silverware this year.
