The 10-year-old girl was kept in a police cell overnight after her family complained that she had been raped by a neighbour (file picture) A 10-year-old Indian girl who was allegedly raped by a neighbour was locked in a cell overnight by police when her family tried to report the crime. The girl was reportedly found barely conscious following the attack close to her home in a village a two hour drive from Delhi last weekend. Her family are now facing death threats and being told to withdraw the complaint. Mother of ten Saroj sent two of her six daughters - the younger of the two aged five - to buy vegetables for the family's evening meal on Sunday, according to The Times. When the pair were on their way home, the older sister was abducted by a man who was following them. The younger of the two girls is said to have run home to tell her parents who found the ten-year-old 100 yards from home. The girl's detention by police has led to an outcry over police oversensitivity and officers have arrested a 29-year-old man from a higher caste on suspicion of rape in response to media pressure. But since the man's arrest the family, who are one of four classed as Dalit, a group of people regarded as 'untouchable', have been threatened by members of the higher Rajput class. Saroj told the Indian Express: 'They are blaming us saying why did we let her go out alone. 'They have been threatening to kill us, burn down our home and stone my daughter to death if we do not withdraw the rape case.' The family now hopes that the media attention their case has attracted will force the police to protect the girl.

chatgpt: In an unfortunate incident, a girl from a lower caste was allegedly raped by a member of a higher caste in India. According to reports, the incident took place when the girl had been sent out to purchase food with her younger sister. The accused, whom the girl had known previously, allegedly lured her to a secluded area and raped her.  As soon as the girl shared the harrowing incident with her family, they took the matter to the local authorities and filed a case against the accused. However, the family's struggle for justice has now been compounded further with threats from the accused's family. The victim and her family have allegedly been threatened to drop the case, with dire consequences if they choose to pursue the matter. The incident has yet again highlighted the deeply ingrained caste system in certain parts of India, which often results in social and economic disparities and discrimination. The caste divide often becomes the root cause of many heinous crimes, such as rape, in the country. The victim's family has appealed to the government and human rights organizations to ensure their safety and urge them to continue the legal fight for justice. The incident has also sparked widespread outrage, and people have taken to social media to express their anger and frustration over the issue. Activists and civil society organizations have demanded stringent action against the accused and his family, as well as measures to ensure the safety of the victim and her family. Moreover, many have criticized the lack of progress in addressing rape cases in India, with many cases remaining unresolved due to a lack of evidence, delayed judicial proceedings, and societal pressures. Experts have suggested that, in many cases, rape survivors continue to face stigmatization, harassment, and violence, which further impede their ability to seek justice. In conclusion, cases such as this once again bring to the fore the need for comprehensive measures to address the deeply-rooted social and economic inequalities in India, as well as improving the safety and security of women, especially those from lower caste backgrounds. The government must also take immediate steps to provide adequate legal and social support to survivors of rape and other sexual crimes so that they can fight without fear of retaliation.
