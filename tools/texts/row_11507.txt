Former Finland President Martii Ahtisaari twice worked to find a solution in Kosovo. "Ahtisaari is an outstanding international mediator," said Ole Danbolt Mjoes, chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. "Through his untiring efforts and good results, he has shown what role mediation of various kinds can play in the resolution of international conflicts." The committee cited Ahtisaari's "significant" part in establishing Namibia's independence and his "central" role in solving the question of the Indonesian province of Aceh in 2005.

He also worked with others this year to find a peaceful solution to the problems in Iraq, the committee said. Ahtisaari and his group, Crisis Management Initiative, also contributed to resolving other conflicts in Northern Ireland, Central Asia, and the Horn of Africa, the committee said. "The Norwegian Nobel Committee wishes to express the hope that others may be inspired by his efforts and his achievements," Mjoes said. The committee awards the peace prize annually according to guidelines laid down in the will of its founder, Alfred Nobel. He specified the prize should go to whoever "shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses." The prestigious prize includes a medal, a personal diploma, and 10 million Swedish crowns ($1.4 million) in prize money. Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore shared last year's prize with the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change. The committee plans to award the prize to Ahtisaari on December 10 at Oslo City Hall in Norway. The peace prize is one of five Nobel prizes awarded annually. The others -- for physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, and literature -- were announced this week and will be awarded in Stockholm, Sweden later this year.

chatgpt: The Norwegian Nobel Committee announced today that it has awarded the 2008 Nobel Peace Prize to Martti Ahtisaari. Ahtisaari was recognized for his long-standing commitment to conflict resolution and peacemaking efforts in many parts of the world. The committee cited Ahtisaari's "significant" role in helping Namibia gain independence from South Africa in the 1980s, as well as his more recent efforts to broker peace in Iraq and the Indonesian province of Aceh. Ahtisaari served as a UN special envoy to both areas, working tirelessly to find peaceful solutions to ongoing conflicts. In Iraq, Ahtisaari worked alongside other UN representatives to encourage dialogue among political parties and to promote respect for human rights. The result was a peaceful transfer of power and the establishment of a new government. Ahtisaari's efforts in Iraq were particularly commendable, given the difficulties and complexities of the situation on the ground. In Aceh, Ahtisaari played a key role in negotiating a peace agreement between the Indonesian government and Islamist rebels. The region had been plagued by decades of violence and instability, but Ahtisaari's efforts paved the way for a lasting peace. Although Ahtisaari left his role as UN special envoy in 2001, he remained deeply committed to peacebuilding and conflict resolution. He established the Crisis Management Initiative, an independent organization dedicated to preventing and resolving conflicts around the world. In a statement released today, the Nobel committee praised Ahtisaari's "unwavering commitment to peace and justice." The committee added that Ahtisaari's work had "made a profound difference in the lives of countless people." The Nobel Peace Prize, established in 1895 by the Swedish inventor and entrepreneur, Alfred Nobel, is awarded annually to individuals or organizations that have made an outstanding contribution to peace. Ahtisaari is the latest in a long line of distinguished recipients, including Nelson Mandela, Mother Teresa, and the International Campaign to Ban Landmines. Ahtisaari expressed his gratitude and said he hoped the award would help to inspire others to work towards a more peaceful and just world. "We must never stop striving for peace," he said. "It is the only way to ensure a better future for all."
