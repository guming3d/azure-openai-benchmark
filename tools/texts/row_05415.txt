One in four children who try to get around parental controls on internet use are looking for pornography, research reveals. The data lays bare the scale of the problem of freely available pornography, as campaigners call for a greater understanding of the damage it can have on children. Web security firm Kaspersky said 23 per cent of searches its software blocked in the UK in the first five months of this year were for pornography. A quarter of children who try to get around parental controls on the internet are looking for porn (picture posed by model) The parent-installed software sends data to the company each time it blocks access to a malicious site if the customer has not opted out of supplying such information. Of nearly 30,000 blocked searches, 23.3 per cent were for porn sites, 19.6 per cent for online stores and 16.1 per cent for social networking sites. It also blocked online gaming sites (5.9 per cent), gambling sites (3.0 per cent) and information about weapons (2.9 per cent). The research, also carried out by Kaspersky on its international customer base, recorded more than 25million attempts to access online porn globally in the last month alone. Other subjects blocked included online gaming sites, gambling sites and information about weapons . The Mail is campaigning for internet providers to automatically block access to porn, with an optional opt-in, rather than parents having to rely on software such as Kaspersky to limit access. At a debate organised by think tank the Policy Exchange in London yesterday, politicians and medical professionals discussed the increasing harm unbridled access to porn is having on teenagers. John Woods, a consultant psychotherapist at the NHS Portman Clinic in London who treats young men and women addicted to porn, told the audience about a 16-year-old patient who sexually assaulted his younger next-door neighbour after becoming addicted to porn. ‘All day he was thinking about the imagery,’ he said. ‘He felt he was losing touch with reality. The relief only came when he switched his computer back on again.’ Gail Dines, professor of sociology and women’s studies at Wheelock College in Boston, said: ‘Asking a family to deal with the porn use of their child is like telling a mother that their children should not breathe in pollution.’

chatgpt: Web security firm Kaspersky has released a report stating that 23% of blocked search requests in the UK are for pornography. The same report details that there have been roughly 25 million failed attempts globally to access pornographic content in the past year. These attempts are part of a broader trend of blocked pages that includes gaming, gambling, and social networking services. The report also shows that almost 3% of blocked searches were for information about weapons. This alarming statistic could be attributed to a recent rise in domestic violence and gang violence. Some experts suspect that the rise in violence is due to the global pandemic forcing many people to remain at home, leading to increased tension and anxiety. Pornography has long been a subject of controversy, with some critics arguing that it can lead to addiction, reduced productivity, and even mental health problems. There is a growing consensus among experts that the rise of technology has made pornography more accessible than ever before. As a result, many people have developed unhealthy habits around their consumption of porn. Web security firms like Kaspersky are essential in the fight against harmful content on the internet. They use advanced algorithms to scan for potentially malicious websites and automatically block them before they can cause harm. However, the difficulty of finding and blocking these sites means that many may still be slipping through undetected. To help address this issue, Kaspersky advises that parents take a proactive role in monitoring their children's online activities. They suggest using parental control software to block access to adult content and educate children on the risks associated with pornography. In conclusion, the Kaspersky report highlights the need for increased vigilance when it comes to protecting our online safety. While many internet users may be unaware of the risks associated with accessing pornography, it's important to be proactive in protecting ourselves and our loved ones from potentially harmful content. With advancements in technology and the ongoing efforts of web security firms, we can all work together to create a safer online environment.
