chatgpt: A family in The Patch, east of Melbourne, has been left devastated after a 30-metre tree fell on their home late on Saturday night. The tragedy has led to the death of one-year-old Eli Marnock, who was sleeping in his cot at the time of the incident. According to reports, there were seven family members inside the house when the tree fell. The sound of the falling tree was described as a loud bang, which woke up the occupants of the house. Sadly, it was too late for little Eli, who was fatally injured in the incident. Neighbours have reported that they had warned the council about the dangerous state of the tree, and had made several requests for it to be cut down. However, their warnings were apparently ignored. One neighbour said, "It's tragic that a life had to be lost for the council to pay attention." The tragedy has left the community in shock and mourning. The local council has expressed their condolences and has promised to investigate the cause of the incident. They have also promised to take action to ensure that such a tragedy does not happen again. The family has released a statement expressing their grief and thanking the community for their support. They said, "We are heartbroken at the loss of our beautiful boy, Eli. He brought so much joy to our lives, and we will miss him dearly. We would like to thank the community for their love and support during this difficult time." The incident has also raised questions about the safety of homes and the responsibility of local councils to ensure that trees and other structures in public spaces are safe. Authorities have reminded the public to remain vigilant and report any safety concerns to their local council. The tragedy in The Patch has served as a reminder that we must always be aware of our surroundings and take steps to ensure our safety and the safety of those around us. Our thoughts and prayers are with the family during this difficult time.
