chatgpt: Former Pakistan cricket team captain Saeed Ajmal has been reported by match officials following Pakistan's defeat by Sri Lanka in a T20 match. Ajmal, who is now 36 years old and serves as a spin bowling coach for the Pakistani cricket team, may face additional scrutiny after being reported for a suspected illegal bowling action. The match in question occurred on October 5, 2021, in Lahore, Pakistan, where Sri Lanka won the T20 match by seven wickets. During the match, Ajmal was observed and flagged by match officials due to concerns that he was bowling with an illegal action, which violates the International Cricket Council's (ICC) regulations. All bowlers in cricket must adhere to these regulations which set limits on how much they can bend their elbows when bowling. According to recent reports, Ajmal will have to undergo testing of his bowling action within the next twenty-one days. However, the spinner is free to continue playing international cricket during this testing period. If the testing reveals an illegal action, Ajmal will be barred from playing for a certain period. Ajmal has had a controversial career since becoming a professional cricketer. In 2014, he was banned from bowling in international cricket for having an illegal action. He then underwent remedial work on his bowling action to have his ban lifted. However, he retired from international cricket in 2017 after experiencing a lack of success on his return to the game. Ajmal has been serving as a spin bowling coach for the Pakistani cricket team for several years now. He has recently been called upon to assist with the national team's preparations for the upcoming T20 World Cup, which begins in the United Arab Emirates on October 17, 2021. It remains to be seen what impact, if any, Ajmal's reported illegal action will have on the Pakistani cricket team's campaign in the T20 World Cup. However, Ajmal and his supporters can take comfort in the fact that he is still free to coach and play during the upcoming testing period.
