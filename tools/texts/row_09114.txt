If you're hoping to lose a few pounds before you hit the beach in a bikini this summer then you might want to ditch regular trips to High Street coffee chains. Many shop bought coffees have the equivalent calories to a fast food feast, with Starbucks in particular a repeat offender against dieters. And while many may now be up to speed with how calorific hot drinks such as full fat lattes are, they may find they're not doing their waistlines any favours by instead opting for a cold drink from coffee shop summer menus. A sensible swap? Ditching a full fat latte, left, for a strawberry frappuccino with cream won't make you slimmer this summer . It may appear healthy because it contains fruit in the title but a large Starbucks strawberry frappuccino contains  a massive  459 calories because of its cream and full-fat milk content. That's almost as many calories as a McDonald's Big Mac. The Starbucks peppermint mocha frappuccino in verdi with whole milk and whipped cream is 540 calories. Costa's strawberry cooler is an even worse offender - a large size with cream and full fat milk is 653 calories -  that's the same as having a MacDonald's burger and fries. Meanwhile, Caffe Nero's whole milk caramel frappe latte is 455 calories, the equivalent to two large glasses of white wine and some pretzels. Sales rising: More people are now turning to herbal teas as a healthier alternative to coffee shop drinks . Now that brands are under more pressure to display nutritional information on their products, consumers are becoming more savvy to the hidden calories in shop bought coffees. As a result, sales of herbal tea is on the rise as people see them as a healthier alternative for a hot drink. Herbal tea brand Higher Living has reported an increase in sales of 36 per cent in recent months, with customers citing that they were keen to embrace the low calorie benefits of teas. Most herbal teas only have a trace amount of calories while some flavours rarely exceed 35 calories. A Higher Living spokesman said: 'It's clear that ordering your favourite coffee can have a significant . impact on your waistline. 'Herbal teas bridge this gap between calories . and taste. There's nothing wrong with the occasional coffee shop splurge, but keep . calories low by mixing things up once in a while.' A study by Mintel found that herbal tea drinkers believed they gained numerous health benefits from their choice of refreshment over coffee consumers. More than half (57 per cent) said that drinking herbal tea helped them to relax while 64 per cent believe in their health benefits.

chatgpt: Calories have become a buzzword in the world of health and wellness in recent years. The calorie content of food and beverages is now one of the primary factors that people consider when making decisions about what to consume. Understanding the calorie content of different drinks and edibles is a big part of maintaining a healthy diet. For those who enjoy cold and refreshing beverages, summer is a great time to explore different options. Starbucks and Caffe Nero are two of the most popular coffee chains in the world, known for their range of drinks and snacks. It's no surprise that they have a wide selection of summer drinks to choose from, which include cold frappes and iced lattes. One of Starbucks' most popular summer drinks is the Strawberry Frappuccino, which contains 459 calories. This delicious drink is a blend of icy milk and strawberry syrup, topped with whipped cream and drizzled with strawberry sauce. It's a favorite among coffee and non-coffee drinkers alike, thanks to its creamy and refreshing taste. Caffe Nero's Whole Milk Caramel Frappe Latte is yet another beverage that is popular with caffeine lovers. This drink is a combination of espresso shots, caramel syrup, and whipped cream, topped with ice cold milk. It packs a whopping 455 calories, making it a drink that is best consumed in moderation. However, these popular drinks pale in comparison to the calorie content of the Large Costa Strawberry Cooler, which contains a staggering 653 calories. This drink is a mix of strawberry puree, lemonade, and ice, topped with whipped cream and more strawberry sauce. With its high calorie count, it's a drink that should be treated like a meal rather than a refreshing beverage. To put these calorie counts into perspective, a McDonald's Big Mac, which is often considered the guilty pleasure of fast food lovers, contains 490 calories. This means that the Costa Strawberry Cooler has more calories than a Big Mac! It's important to note that calorie content is not the only factor to consider when making food and drink choices. Many nutritionists recommend looking at the nutritional value and ingredients of a beverage when making decisions about what to consume. In conclusion, when it comes to summer drinks, it's important to be aware of the calorie content of different options. While Starbucks' Strawberry Frappuccino and Caffe Nero's Whole Milk Caramel Frappe Latte are popular choices, they should be consumed in moderation. The high calorie count of the Large Costa Strawberry Cooler is a reminder that some beverages can be just as calorie-dense as a Big Mac. Don't let the calorie content of these drinks deter you from enjoying them, but be mindful of how often you indulge in them.
