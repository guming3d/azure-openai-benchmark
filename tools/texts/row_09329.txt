article: By . Sara Malm for MailOnline . A pair of brothers have come up with a way to have a high-flying holiday on a budget – by building a human catapult . Johannes and Daniel Schrieber had been looking for a cheap alternative to flying, so constructed a 1,100lb catapult out of wood and old bicycle tubes. As you do. Despite the device raising several health and safety issues, the brothers claim they have taken precautions, by getting clarification from the German Aerospace Centre. Scroll down for video . Safety last: The 1,100lbs human catapult build by Johannes and Daniel Schrieber is seen in action at a lake in Frankfurt . Johannes, 26, and Daniel, 28, from Frankfurt, raised more than £700 through crowdfunding to make their 'budget flight' dream come true. Johannes, an engineering student, and Daniel, a maths graduate, then spent ten months constructing the mammoth machine in their grandmother’s barn, using old bicycle tubes as the spring. The contraption fires a person of average height and weight a distance of 40 feet, sending them about 16ft into the air. Johannes said: ‘Daniel and I wanted to give people the chance to fly - without the need for a plane. ‘You might not get as far, but it will certainly be hell of a lot of fun.' Safety first: The home-made human catapult sends a person into a 16ft high arch, and into a lake . Brothers in arms: Johannes Schrieber, 26, and brother Daniel, 28, from Frankfurt constructed the human catapult out of wood and old bicycle tubes . Spare-time fun: The brothers spent ten months in their grandmother's barn, constructing the human catapult . Come fly with me: Engineering student Johannes, gives a thumbs up before being launched into the lake . Up, up and away: To make sure their device was safe, the brothers had their catapult certified by the German Aerospace Centre . Mr Shrieber added: ‘All the research and funding was boring - but necessary - but now it's finished, the catapult is nothing but fun! ‘People can't really control what they do mid-air but more often than not they end up doing a somersault.’ To make sure nobody passed out from the G forces, the pair contacted the Institute of Aerodynamics and Flow Technology for clarification. Johannes said: ‘Our grand uncle told us people passed out in war planes from acceleration and we didn't want that happening. ‘Fortunately everything's alright and nobody has died yet!’ Great success: Johannes and Daniel are pleased with their human catapult as no one has died yet! Holidaying on a budget: The brothers say that the aim of the catapult was to offer everyone a chance to fly .

chatgpt: Two brothers from Brighton, Johannes and Daniel Schrieber, have built a 1,100lb catapult that can fling a person 40ft into an adjacent lake with a 16ft high arc. The machine, which the brothers constructed themselves, was funded using crowdfunding and raised £700 towards its creation. The brothers started the project several months ago after being inspired by a television show they saw about large contraptions. They spent their free time designing and building the catapult, and after months of hard work, they were finally able to unveil it to the public. The catapult, which they named "Project TwoPointOh", has become a sensation among the locals in Brighton. Although the brothers were initially nervous about trying it out themselves, they eventually decided to take the plunge and try it out. Daniel Schrieber, one half of the duo behind the creation, said that it was a nerve-wracking experience: "It was definitely scary, especially when I was perched on the edge of the platform looking down into the lake. But once the catapult fired and I was soaring through the air, it was an incredible experience." The catapult works by using a counterweight system to fling a person into the air. The user climbs onto a platform at the end of the catapult arm, and a team of assistants load counterweights onto the opposite side of the machine. When the user is ready, the counterweights are released, sending the person flying through the air. Despite the risks involved in using such a machine without professional supervision, the brothers say that they are confident in their creation. They have taken great care in designing and testing the contraption to make sure that it is as safe as possible for users. Johannes Schrieber, the other half of the duo, said that they have plans to continue improving the catapult and exploring new ways to use it: "We're always thinking of ways to push the limits of what our machine can do. We're thinking about adding more counterweights to increase the height and distance of the launch." The brothers have inspired many with their project, and have shown that with a little creativity, determination, and crowdfunding, anything is possible. They hope that their catapult will continue to bring joy and excitement to those who use it, and that it will inspire others to create their own contraptions. In conclusion, Johannes and Daniel Schrieber have built a remarkable device that captures the imaginations of those who experience it. With its crowdfunding success, they can continue to innovate and enhance the catapult. The brothers’ project has brought a thrill and excitement to locals in Brighton, and they have proven that with dedication and hard work, anyone can achieve their goals.
