chatgpt: Former model Kristina Liliana Matthaus, 26, found herself in legal trouble as she was charged with third-degree grand larceny for allegedly stealing financier Michael Hadjedj's American Express card. Matthaus, who was previously married to former captain of West Germany's soccer team Lothar Matthaus, has raised eyebrows before when rumors of infidelity circulated during the couple's 2010 separation. According to Matthaus' lawyer, she was given permission to use the card, but her boyfriend became angry and reported the alleged theft after Matthaus broke up with him. The stolen amount remains undisclosed. Matthaus appeared in court on Wednesday, where she pleaded not guilty to the charges. She is currently being held on $10,000 bail. The former model has been in the public eye for years, making headlines for her past relationships with high-profile men, including soccer players and politicians. However, her most recent scandal has put her on a different kind of stage. Grand larceny is considered a felony in New York, carrying a maximum prison sentence of seven years. Matthaus has retained lawyer Jeremy Saland to help defend her against these charges. Saland told reporters that his client had every right to use the American Express card, as she had been given permission to do so. He also alleged that the theft allegations were a result of a bitter breakup between Matthaus and her now-ex-boyfriend. "Unfortunately, this is a classic tale of sour grapes," Saland said. "My client had a relationship with another person who became upset after it ended. As a result, she is now accused of a crime which she had every right to commit." Matthaus' case will be heard again on January 13. Until then, she remains behind bars. This latest scandal is just the latest in a series of legal woes for the former model, who was previously arrested for shoplifting in 2018. She was also involved in a hit-and-run accident in 2015, which resulted in a civil lawsuit against her. It remains to be seen how this latest criminal charge will affect her future, but one thing is for sure: Matthaus' past will continue to follow her as she faces the legal system once again.
