chatgpt: Italian midfielder Daniele de Rossi has been handed a three-game ban by the Italian Football Federation for a "deliberate" punch on Inter Milan forward Mauro Icardi during Roma's 1-1 Serie A draw on Sunday. De Rossi was shown a straight red card in the 40th minute of the match after video replays showed him punching Icardi in the stomach. The 35-year-old will now miss crucial fixtures against Sampdoria, Milan and Udinese.  In addition to this, Inter Milan defender Juan Jesus has also been banned for two games by the disciplinary panel for punching Roma's Lorenzo Pellegrini during the same match. The Brazilian was not shown a red card during the match, but the panel decided to take retrospective action based on video evidence. The punishments have resulted in Italy manager Cesare Prandelli being forced to make changes to his squad for upcoming fixtures against Portugal and the United States. De Rossi, who has earned 117 caps for Italy, and striker Mario Balotelli, who has also been excluded from the squad, will not be available for selection. The news of De Rossi's ban has sparked widespread debate in the football community, with some experts questioning the severity of the punishment. Many have argued that the Italian's punch was not malicious and did not deserve such a lengthy ban. However, others have pointed out that the rulebook is clear on violent conduct and that de Rossi's action was a clear breach of the regulations. This is not the first time that de Rossi has been involved in disciplinary action during his career. The midfielder has a reputation for being a combative presence on the pitch and has previously been involved in spats with opponents. However, he also enjoys a good reputation as a skilled and experienced player who brings leadership and intensity to his team. The ban will be a blow to Roma, who are currently fourth in Serie A and fighting for a Champions League spot. The Giallorossi will have to adjust their tactics and personnel for the upcoming games, with coach Claudio Ranieri likely to opt for a more defensive approach in midfield. Overall, the incident serves as a reminder of the importance of fair play and sportsmanship in football. Whilst it is understandable that players can and will become frustrated on the pitch, it is important that they do not resort to violent or unsporting behaviour. Ultimately, the game should be about skill, technique and teamwork, not about physical altercations or individual ego trips.
