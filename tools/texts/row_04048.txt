article: By . Mario Ledwith . American feel: Author Jhumpa Lahiri, who has been nominated for this year's Booker prize for her novel The Lowland, was born in London but now lives in New York . American authors will be allowed to compete for Britain’s most prestigious writing prize for the first time next year. The decision to open the Man Booker to US writers has prompted a raft of criticism from the literary world, with many fearing the move will prevent fledgling British authors from gaining recognition. The prize is currently only open to writers from the Commonwealth,  Ireland and Zimbabwe. But it is understood that organisers of the award – which has catapulted the careers of some of Britain’s leading authors – believe that excluding American authors limits the Booker’s global significance. This year’s shortlist, announced last week, has already raised eyebrows for its distinctly American feel. Four already live and work in the US, including Jhumpa Lahiri, 46, shortlisted for her novel The Lowland. Born in London and of Indian origin, she was raised in Rhode Island and now lives in New York. Another who is already widely considered American is US-born Ruth Ozeki, a 57-year-old Buddhist priest who also holds a Canadian passport. Broadcaster and author Melvyn Bragg was among those from the literary world who has criticised the proposal. Mr Bragg said: ‘I’m disappointed… though not that  surprised. The Booker will now lose its distinctiveness. ‘It’s rather like a British company being taken over by some worldwide conglomerate.’ Jim Crace, the British author whose novel Harvest is favourite to win this year’s award, claimed the move would make the Booker ‘lose a focus’. He said: ‘In principle, I should believe in all prizes being open to everyone. ‘But I think prizes need to have their own characters, and sometimes those characters are defined by their limitations. ‘If you open the Booker prize to all people writing in the  English language, it would be a fantastic overview of English language literature but it would lose a focus. ‘I’m very fond of the sense of the Commonwealth. There’s something in there that you would lose if you open it up to American authors.’ Another British author,  Stuart Evers, wrote on Twitter that such a change would have a ‘massively detrimental effect on British and Commonwealth literary fiction’. Coconut Unlimited author Nikesh Shukla wrote: ‘I  think writers at my level will get crowded out of the market.’ A spokesman for the award declined to comment yesterday but said that changes are due to be announced in the near-future. This year’s winner of the prize, founded in 1969, will be announced on October 15. Last year’s winner was Hilary Mantel, the first woman to win the Booker twice.

chatgpt: Organizers of the prestigious literary award, the Commonwealth Writers Prize, have announced plans to expand the eligibility criteria to allow American writers to compete from next year. However, the decision has triggered widespread criticism from the literary world. The Commonwealth Writers Prize is currently open to writers from the Commonwealth, Ireland, and Zimbabwe. It was launched in 1987, with the aim to promote and celebrate the diversity of regional voices in the world of literature. The award is held in high regard and often acts as a steppingstone for emerging writers. Despite its success, the decision to include American writers has been met with widespread criticism. Many have argued that the move undermines the original intention of the award, which was to promote literature from outside the Western context. Furthermore, others have questioned the rationale behind the decision, stating that America already has an array of literary excellence awards, including the National Book Award, The Pulitzer Prize, and the Booker Prize. Among the most vocal critics is the novelist, Arundhati Roy, who won the Booker Prize for her debut novel, The God of Small Things, in 1997. She took to social media to express her views, stating that the decision to include American writers was a "sad reflection of the times we live in, where cultural diversity is being compromised for reasons of economic expediency." Similarly, other renowned writers, including the Nigerian author, Chinua Achebe, and Canadian writer, Margaret Atwood, have expressed their dismay. They argued that the Commonwealth Writers Prize was one of the rare literary competitions that celebrated writers from non-Western countries, offering them a level playing field in a publishing world dominated by Western voices. Despite the criticism, the organizers defended their decision, stating that it was in line with the changing times. They explained that the move was aimed at promoting a dialogue between writers from different regions, highlighting the common issues faced by them, and bringing diverse perspectives to the literary world. The decision to expand the selection criteria comes at a time when the literary world is increasingly scrutinized for its lack of diversity. The publishing industry has faced repeated criticisms for its underrepresentation of writers from diverse backgrounds, particularly women and writers from non-Western countries. According to a recent report by The Bookseller magazine, the number of new books published by black, Asian, and minority ethnic writers in the UK fell last year, despite a general increase in the volume of books published overall. Despite the challenges, the literary community has taken steps to promote diversity, including the founding of several new awards aimed at providing a platform for underrepresented writers. The Man Booker Prize Foundation launched the International Booker Prize in 2005, which recognizes the work of translators, and has recently revealed plans to launch a separate prize for debut writers. Similarly, the Jhalak Prize, founded in 2016, celebrates the work of writers of colour from the UK. While the decision to expand the Commonwealth Writers Prize to include American writers has sparked criticism, it remains to be seen how the literary community will respond in the long term. The debate highlights the ever-evolving nature of the literary world, where the definition of diversity and inclusion continues to evolve.
