article: Call it Yelp for moving vans. Unpakt, a comparison site that lets visitors find reputable moving companies and book them online, announced Monday that it's expanding its services, adding the ability to get free, instant price quotes through the site and a tool to help calculate the total cost of a move from various services. "My goal in founding Unpakt was to bring transparency to the moving industry while taking the hassle out of the booking process for consumers," Sharone Ben-Harosh, founder and CEO of Unpakt, said in a media release. Ben-Harosh has worked in the moving industry for more than two decades and started his own company in 1991. Part of Unpakt's mission is to eliminate what he says is a common practice among movers -- quoting a price to customers, then adding fees for what are presented as unanticipated costs. Movers booked through the site agree to a flat rate for a job instead of providing an estimate. Unpakt takes a percentage of the fee for jobs booked through the site. Headquartered in New York City, Unpakt is currently available in 45 states and in over 280 cities. Most recently, the site has added moving companies in Denver, Colorado; Santa Fe, New Mexico; Raleigh, North Carolina; Cheyenne, Wyoming and Davenport, Iowa. With the new Quick Quotes feature, users will get price quotes from Unpakt's pre-approved companies in less than one minute. They can select an offer immediately, locking in the offered price. The Moving Cost Calculator is a widget that can be installed on other websites. It uses the user's basic moving information, like home size and moving address, and then provides three quotes from local moving companies. Unpakt has approved more than 500 moving companies for its site.

chatgpt: Unpakt, the popular online moving platform, has announced the launch of two new tools aimed at making the process of moving even easier for its users. With its reputation for providing instant quotes from reliable and trustworthy moving companies, Unpakt has been revolutionizing the way people move their homes and businesses. Now, with the addition of the new tools, Unpakt hopes to take things to the next level. The first tool, known as the "Lock-In Price" feature, enables users to secure a guaranteed price for their move, rather than just an estimate. This is a significant development, as it provides greater clarity and transparency for users, eliminating the worry of hidden fees or unexpected costs. The second tool is the "Visual Inventory" feature, which allows users to create a virtual inventory of their belongings. This is incredibly useful for both customers and moving companies, as it makes packing and logistics much easier. By uploading images of their belongings, users can get more accurate quotes and ensure that their items are packed and transported safely. "We're thrilled to be launching these two features," said Matt Corgan, Unpakt's CEO. "They're going to make the already-easy process of booking moving services even more transparent and user-friendly. We think our customers will love them." Unpakt has earned a reputation for being a go-to platform for anyone who needs to move. With its easy-to-use interface and comprehensive list of moving companies, it has quickly become one of the best ways to book moving services. The addition of the two new features is just the latest example of Unpakt's commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction. In conclusion, Unpakt's latest two tools are set to make a substantial impact on the moving industry. The Lock-In Price feature and Visual Inventory will take the stress out of the moving process, providing customers with a clear understanding of the costs and logistics involved. Unpakt has once again demonstrated its ability to innovate and deliver tools that make life easier for its users.
