article: (CNN) -- Calling attention to a logjam of stalled diplomatic nominations in the Senate, Secretary of State John Kerry said the delay is harming U.S. national security. In direct public commentary on an issue crossing politics and diplomacy, Kerry called for swift approval of the nominees, many of whom are career diplomats. Some were selected for difficult jobs in global hotspots. "Make no mistake: Vacancies in so many world capitals send a dangerous message to allies and adversaries alike about America's engagement," Kerry said in an opinion piece for Politico on Tuesday. "This perception makes it much more difficult to do the nonpartisan work at the heart of U.S. foreign policy â€” defending the security of our nation, promoting our values and helping our businesses compete to create American jobs back home," he added. Fifty-three State Department nominees await confirmation. Nearly two thirds are uncontroversial career diplomats who are caught up in a partisan standoff that has nothing to do with them or the jobs they've been tapped to undertake. Democrats lead the chamber and accuse Republicans of delaying confirmation votes as payback for new rules aimed at making it easier to break Republican filibusters on nominations. Republicans require separate votes for each nominee, rather than the customary practice of allowing votes on multiple names at once. White House spokesman Josh Earnest urged Senate Republicans to, "stop playing political games and let these individuals get to work on behalf of the American people." But Republicans blame the other side. In an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper, Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio said the GOP has no choice but to take the slow approach. "The leaderships on the Democratic side of the aisle has chosen, for the first time ever, at least in modern history, to say, 'You know, Republicans are not going to have a voice in these nominees,'" Portman said of the rules change. Now, Kerry is urging members of both parties to cooperate and act swiftly. Some 40 countries are awaiting permanent ambassadors, including Qatar and Kuwait, Gulf allies whose cooperation is critical to the fight against extremists in Iraq. Embassies in Honduras and Guatemala are also waiting for new ambassadors at a time when unaccompanied minors from Central America are surging across the southern border, creating what the White House calls a humanitarian crisis. And in Africa, nearly a quarter of U.S. missions are awaiting permanent ambassadors. Those include Cameroon and Niger, where the State Department insists the lack of American leadership has hampered efforts to recover hundreds of schoolgirls abducted by the Boko Haram extremist group in neighboring Nigeria this year. "Ambassadors are there for a reason," Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Linda Thomas-Greenfield told CNN. "They speak for the President. They speak for the administration. Not having those voices on the ground has made a difference in our ability to convey the messages we need to convey to these governments."

chatgpt: The confirmation of dozens of US government nominees has been held up by political wrangling in the Senate, according to sources close to the matter. Among those awaiting Senate approval are several career diplomats, who are highly qualified for the positions they have been nominated for, but face delays due to partisan politics. Many of the nominees awaiting confirmation are being appointed to key diplomatic positions around the world, including some of the world's most volatile regions. According to Secretary of State John Kerry, some of these nominees are destined for hotspots where US leadership is urgently needed to manage and stabilize fragile situations. Despite their qualifications and the urgency of their appointments, these nominees have been made targets by politicians who are using the confirmation process as a tool to advance their own political agendas. The delay is not only frustrating for the nominees and their families, but it is also creating a void in America's international presence. The role of US Ambassador is a critical one when it comes to fostering good relationships with foreign governments and promoting American interests abroad. For this reason, past Administrations have often appointed donors and political friends to these positions. However, the Obama Administration has sought to change this by appointing more qualified candidates, especially those who are experienced diplomats. Career diplomats are better positioned to navigate complex diplomatic terrain and are able to build the long-term relationships that are crucial for promoting American interests. They are able to work through difficult cultural and linguistic barriers, which helps them to create stronger and more meaningful relationships with their foreign counterparts. What is most concerning is that the Senate's inaction has left some of the world's most dangerous hotspots without experienced diplomats in place to manage difficult situations. For example, the high-profile nomination of Nancy Powell to become Ambassador to India has been stalled for months, leaving the US without a key representative in this critical region. Similarly, no ambassador is currently posted to Syria or Libya, exposing America's lack of diplomatic engagement in two key conflict zones. The Senate's continued stalling tactics are impacting the broader operations of US government, as it is also leaving vacancies in key administrative positions. Many are worried that this paralysis will limit the government's ability to function at a time when the country is facing both domestic and international pressures. Secretary Kerry has made it clear that he believes these delays are simply unacceptable. The Secretary has called for a swift resolution to these issues, stating that these nominees have been thoroughly vetted and that they are the best possible candidates for the job. He believes that it is essential to get qualified individuals in place as soon as possible to enable the US to fully engage with the international community. Some experts suggest that the delay is due to partisan politics and the upcoming mid-term elections, as Senators are reluctant to make decisions that may negatively impact their chances of re-election. Whatever the underlying cause, it is clear that the failure to confirm these key appointments is having a serious impact on America's international profile. In closing, it is hoped that the Senate will recognize the urgency of these appointments and move quickly to confirm the nominees without further delays. With so many key positions currently vacant, the US government must take action now to ensure that it can continue to operate effectively around the world, and to maintain its leadership and international prestige.
