chatgpt: Former basketball star Dennis Rodman has checked himself into rehab in New Jersey, following his controversial trip to North Korea, where he blamed an outburst during a CNN interview on alcohol. Rodman, who is 52 years old, has struggled with addiction to alcohol for many years, and has undergone treatment three times before. This latest stint in rehab suggests that his problems with alcohol continue to be a major issue for the former NBA star. Rodman's recent visit to North Korea was his second in just a few months, and caused widespread controversy due to his close relationship with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. During an interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo, Rodman became increasingly defensive and belligerent, ultimately yelling at Cuomo and defending Kim's regime. After the interview, Rodman apologized for his behavior, telling TMZ that he had been drinking before the interview and was not in a good state of mind. In an official statement released by his publicist, Rodman said that he was "sorry for the hurt I caused" and that he "denounced the actions" of Kim Jong-un. Despite his apology, Rodman's behavior during the North Korea trip drew widespread criticism, particularly given the country's poor human rights record and its recent nuclear weapons tests. Many observers felt that Rodman was giving undue legitimacy to a dangerous and oppressive regime. Rodman's check-in to rehab is a sign that the former basketball star is serious about addressing his addiction issues. However, it remains to be seen whether he will be able to stay sober and avoid future incidents like the one in North Korea. According to his publicist, Rodman is currently undergoing "intensive therapy" at a rehab facility in New Jersey. The statement also said that Rodman "has a long history of alcoholism" and that he is "committed to sobriety and a healthy lifestyle." Rodman's struggles with addiction have been well-documented over the years. In addition to his three stints in rehab, he has been arrested multiple times for DUI and public intoxication. Despite his troubles, Rodman remains a popular figure in many circles, particularly among NBA fans who remember his glory days with the Chicago Bulls and Detroit Pistons. He has also become something of a celebrity in recent years thanks to his appearances on reality TV shows like Celebrity Apprentice and Celebrity Big Brother. For now, however, Rodman's focus will be on getting better and addressing his addiction issues. Whether he can successfully overcome his demons remains to be seen.
