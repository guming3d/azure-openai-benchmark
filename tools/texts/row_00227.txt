It's not the ideal situation. We know how things get blown up very quickly at this level and particularly when powerful people in the game give big opinions on situations, the media run with it. 'It's an interesting part of his learning curve. It's not something that's come his way before, I'm pretty sure of that, but he's a steady lad, he's been doing tremendously for us. 'The lads obviously are all round that situation, as are the staff, so onwards and upwards for him. 'I hope that he just plays with the freedom he has been. That's it in a nutshell.'

chatgpt: Manchester United midfielder Nemanja Matic has been suspended for two matches after his red card for reacting angrily to a tackle from Burnley's Ashley Barnes. However, Barnes managed to escape punishment for the tackle which led to the Serbian midfielder's dismissal.
The incident occurred during the second half of United's 2-0 defeat at Turf Moor on Saturday. Matic appeared to kick out at Barnes after a late challenge from the Burnley striker, prompting referee Jonathan Moss to brandish the red card. Following the match, Burnley manager Sean Dyche spoke out in defense of Barnes, saying that the players have rallied around him. "It's not easy when something like that happens to one of your own," said Dyche. "But the players have come together and shown a great deal of character to lift Ashley up and keep him focused on his game." The incident has sparked debate about the consistency of the Football Association (FA) in dealing with violent conduct. While Matic has been handed a two-match ban, Barnes has faced no further action from the FA. Some have argued that the FA's disciplinary system is flawed, with punishments often seeming arbitrary and inconsistent. United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has criticized Moss's decision to send off Matic, calling it "a joke." However, he also acknowledged that his player's reaction was "unacceptable." "We can't react like this," said Solskjaer. "We have to stay focused and play the game the right way." This is not the first time that the FA's disciplinary system has come under fire. In recent years, there have been a number of high-profile incidents where players have received harsh punishments for relatively minor offenses, while others have got away with similar actions without any repercussions. Despite the controversy surrounding the incident, Burnley fans will be pleased with the way their team responded to the setback. The Clarets put in a resolute defensive performance to secure the win and climb further away from the relegation zone. For United, the defeat is a blow to their hopes of finishing in the top four this season, as they remain three points behind fourth-placed Chelsea in the Premier League table.
