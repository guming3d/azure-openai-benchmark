A report by the Safer Harlow Partnership revealed he had threatened to kill her two months earlier . Two months before her death, McLernon squeezed her by the throat until she could no longer breathe while threatening 'he would kill her'. Essex Police asked the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for advice on whether he could be charged with an offence at the time. The CPS decided there was not enough evidence but later admitted the had made the wrong decision. The report also revealed McLernon had a history with mental health service providers.

'In our hearts, we feel had action been taken at that point, it would have made a difference.' The report’s author, Jackie Sully, said no one could be sure if charging McLernon would have changed the course of events leading to Miss Blunnie’s death. She was concerned that agencies involved in domestic violence cases did not share information internally or with other organisations. She said: 'If nobody is getting the bigger picture, how on earth can you take steps to prevent what sometimes seems inevitable?' A Essex Police spokesman said: 'We acknowledge the findings of this review and we have worked hard to address the recommendations that have been made. 'We are committed to improving the police and partnership working that underpins the effective combating of domestic abuse.' The CPS have been contacted for comment.

According to the Safer Harlow Partnership, McLernon had threatened to kill Blunnie before. He also squeezed the mother-to-be's throat two months prior to her death.

He was sentenced to life in prison and will serve a minimum of 21 years. Speaking after the trial, Detective Chief Inspector Daniel Stoten praised the hard work of the police and prosecution team in securing justice for Blunnie and her family.

If you or someone you know is experiencing domestic violence, it is important to seek help as soon as possible. There are a number of charities and support services available that can provide advice, support and assistance to those in need.
