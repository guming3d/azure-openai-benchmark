Probe: Inaki Urdangarin will not take part in official royal engagements in Spain because he is under investigation for siphoning off funds . King Juan Carlos' son-in-law will stop taking part in official ceremonies because his business dealings are under investigation, Spain's Royal Palace said today. Inaki Urdangarin, 43, is suspected of siphoning away funds from public contracts awarded from 2004 to 2006 to a non-profit foundation he then headed. The allegation looks terrible for the royal family at a time of acute hardship and economic crisis in Spain, where unemployment stands at 21.5 per cent. Mr Urdangarin, husband of the monarch's daughter Princess Cristina, made the decision mutually with the Royal Palace, according to its chief of staff. He has not been charged with a crime and issued a statement on Saturday saying he regrets the 'damage' the case is causing the royal family, but admitted no wrongdoing. Rafael Spottorno, chief of staff at the palace, said Mr Urdangarin will be removed from the royal family's agenda and will no longer attend official ceremonies involving it. He said it was not yet known if Princess Cristina would also stay away from activities.

Duties: Princess Cristina at the World Swimming Championships in Barcelona in 2003. She lives with her husband in Washington D.C. The couple and their four children now live in Washington, D.C., where Mr Urdangarin works for Spanish telecommunications company Telefonica. Spanish newspapers, quoting investigators, have reported that he is suspected of taking part of around €6million the foundation received from regional governments in Valencia and the Balearic Islands for organising events such as sports seminars. The money is said to have gone to for-profit companies he ran. The case is part of a broader, long-running corruption probe involving the regional government in the Balearic Islands, the capital of which is Palma on the island of Mallorca. News of the scandal has made the front page of Spanish newspapers for the past two weeks and forced the Royal Palace to take the rare step of addressing publicly the activities of one of its members. Mr Spottorno said that by the end of December, the Royal Palace website will publish a breakdown of the money earmarked for the family in the government budget. In 2011, it was €8.43million. King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia have three children. Crown Prince Felipe is the youngest, Princess Cristina in the middle child and the eldest is Princess Elena.

chatgpt: Former professional handball player, 43-year-old Inaki Urdangarin, is currently on trial for embezzling public funds from contracts awarded to the foundation he once led. Urdangarin was married to Princess Cristina, the sister of King Felipe VI, and had been a member of Spain's royal family until 2012 when he was forced to step away from public engagements.  The trial began in January 2016, and came to an end in February 2017, with Urdangarin being sentenced to six years and three months in prison. During the trial, Urdangarin was accused of using his position to secure contracts for the Noos foundation, which he headed, and then siphoning off the money for personal gain. The foundation was established to promote sports and cultural events, however, it was found that more than €6m ($6.4m) of public money had been misused according to the court. Reports suggest that Urdangarin had access to the highest levels of the Spanish government and that he was able to secure significant public contracts due to his connections with the royal family. It was alleged that the funds siphoned away from the Noos foundation were used to pay for personal expenses and also went towards paying off a mortgage on a luxurious property which Urdangarin owned in Spain. Urdangarin has always maintained his innocence and in a statement issued through his lawyer, he expressed his "regret at the damage this case has caused to the royal family and to the people of Spain." However, he admitted to no wrongdoing. The case was seen as a major blow to the Spanish royal family, which traditionally enjoyed a high level of public support. The decision to step away from public engagements was reportedly made mutually with the Royal Palace in order to protect the reputation of the Spanish monarchy. The case had a significant impact on the wider Spanish public, with many seeing it as representative of the country's wider problems with corruption. The trial also came at a time when Spain was still recovering from the financial crisis, which had affected the nation deeply. In conclusion, the case against Inaki Urdangarin represents one of the most high-profile corruption cases in recent Spanish history. The sentencing of Urdangarin to more than six years in prison also demonstrated the growing intolerance of the Spanish public towards such cases. Despite Urdangarin's protestations of innocence, the guilty verdict and sentencing demonstrate a significant advance in Spain's ongoing efforts to combat corruption.
