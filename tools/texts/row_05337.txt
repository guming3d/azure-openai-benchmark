After the 2010 election Mr Boulton had asked him whether it was in the ‘national interest’ for Gordon Brown to spend four more years ‘limping on’ as Prime Minister. Mr Campbell retorted that Mr Boulton was obviously ‘upset’ that David Cameron had not been elected Prime Minister. An angry Mr Boulton then starting yelling: ‘I am not upset. I’m fed up with you telling me what I think'.
