article: By . Emma Glanfield . One in four office workers keep an eye on their emails as they eat, according to a new study by O2 . Half of office workers now eat lunch at their desks and one in four keep an eye on their emails as they eat, according to a new study. Researchers also found office workers spend an average of just 15 minutes eating their lunch with 15.8million workers failing to take a full lunch hour. The poll, by O2 Priority to launch its £1 Lunch, found the most commonly stated excuse for workers failing to take a proper lunch break was being ‘too busy’ - with one in six people even feeling guilty about leaving their desk. It also found that time pressures are not the only thing stopping people from enjoying a lunch break. More than a third said the cost of food was the biggest factor affecting their decision of what to buy for lunch and more than one in four workers opt to take a packed lunch to work to save cash, according to the research. In what is perhaps a reflection of ever-busier lives, the lunch break is increasingly used as admin time for workers’ personal lives. The most common admin tasks performed by workers during their lunch break are internet banking (40 per cent), personal phone calls (39 per cent), booking appointments (29 per cent), shopping online (28 per cent) and paying bills (21 per cent). Food psychologist Doctor Christy Fergusson said workers who eat at their desks could be in danger of overeating.

chatgpt: A new study by O2 has found that millions of workers across the country are failing to take a proper lunch break, with most taking just 15 minutes away from their desks. The report reveals that a staggering 15.8 million people are not taking their full lunch break, with many opting to eat at their desks, or not taking a break at all. The poll found that one in four workers keep an eye on their emails while eating, with many feeling pressure to remain connected to work at all times. This phenomenon is known as ‘presenteeism’, where employees feel the need to be seen to be working, or being available, even when they are supposed to be on a break. In addition to this, the poll found that one in four workers are now taking a packed lunch to save money, rather than eating out. Many cited the high cost of food and drinks at work as a major factor in their decision to bring their own lunch. The study corresponds to previous research which found that taking a proper lunch break is important for maintaining productivity and reducing stress levels. According to the research, breaks are important for allowing people to recharge their batteries and return to work with renewed focus. However, the trend of not taking a proper lunch break has become increasingly common in recent years, with many employees feeling pressure to work longer hours and show greater commitment to their jobs. Commenting on the results of the study, a spokesperson for O2 said: “It’s worrying to see so many workers not taking their full lunch break. It’s important for people to take time away from their desks and relax, whether that means going for a walk, eating lunch away from their workstation, or simply taking a few minutes to clear their heads.” The research also highlights the need for employers to ensure their employees feel comfortable taking a break and disconnecting from work. Measures such as providing comfortable break rooms and encouraging staff to take time off can help to promote a healthier work-life balance, and ultimately improve job satisfaction and productivity. Overall, the study serves as a timely reminder of the importance of taking a proper lunch break, and the potential negative consequences of not doing so. Whether it’s catching up with friends, taking a walk or simply enjoying a good meal, taking the time to switch off from work can have a positive impact on both our physical and mental health.
