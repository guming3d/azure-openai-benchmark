article: The Department of Justice announced on Thursday it has reached an agreement with the city of Albuquerque, New Mexico, to address a "pattern or practice of excessive force" by the problem-plagued Albuquerque Police Department. The DOJ said the city has agreed to allow an independent monitor and the courts to oversee reforms at the police department, along with community input and involvement. According to a joint statement, the department and the city plan to implement reform in eight areas of concern:  "use of force policies, interactions with individuals with mental illness and other disabilities, tactical units, training, internal investigations and civilian complaints, management and supervision, recruitment and selection of officers, and community engagement and oversight." "This agreement marks an important step forward in addressing the unreasonable use of deadly force uncovered in our investigation into the Albuquerque Police Department," Attorney General Eric Holder said Thursday. The Justice Department concluded in a report released in April that Albuquerque Police had a history of  brutality and unnecessary deadly force. "The pattern and practice is the result of serious systemic deficiencies in policy, training, supervision and accountability. The police department's failure to ensure that officers respect the Constitution undermines public trust," the DOJ said in the report. "I am confident that the Albuquerque Police Department will be able to correct troubling practices, restore public trust, and better protect its citizens against all threats and dangers -- while providing the model of professionalism and fairness that all Americans deserve," Holder said. The reforms will include input from the community and the police department.  "We have asked for and received valuable ideas and insights from officers, members of the community, representatives of many organizations, and others who have a stake in the future of our community," said Damon Martinez,  U.S. attorney for the District of New Mexico.

chatgpt: The U.S. Department of Justice and the city of Albuquerque have reached an agreement on police reforms to address allegations of deadly practices and brutality by the Albuquerque Police Department. The agreement calls for an independent monitor and a federal court to oversee the implementation of these reforms.  The Justice Department issued a report in April 2014, which documented a pattern of excessive use of force by the Albuquerque Police Department that resulted in the death of several individuals. The report identified a "culture of aggression" within the department and called for urgent reform.  Since then, the city and the Justice Department have engaged in lengthy negotiations to address the problem. The newly-agreed upon reforms seek to improve accountability and transparency within the department, as well as promote community policing practices.  The independent monitor, who is yet to be named, will have full access to the department's policies, procedures, and operations. The monitor will also produce public reports on the department's progress towards reform.  The agreement also calls for the implementation of new use-of-force policies and the creation of a civilian team to investigate officer-involved shootings. Additionally, the city will improve its crisis intervention training and increase the use of body-worn cameras on police officers.  The reforms will be overseen by a federal court, which will retain jurisdiction over the matter until the city has fully implemented the measures agreed upon. This process is expected to take several years.  "This agreement is a significant step forward for the city of Albuquerque and for the Albuquerque Police Department," said U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch in a written statement. "We are committed to ensuring that our law enforcement agencies uphold the highest standards of professionalism and accountability and that they respect the constitutional rights of every individual."  The Albuquerque Police Department is one of the largest law enforcement agencies in New Mexico, with over 900 sworn officers. The department has been the subject of intense scrutiny in recent years due to allegations of police brutality and the use of excessive force.  The reforms agreed upon between the city and the Justice Department aim to address these issues and improve the relationship between the police department and the community it serves. It remains to be seen how effective these reforms will be in practice, but the agreement is seen as an important step forward for the city of Albuquerque and its residents.
