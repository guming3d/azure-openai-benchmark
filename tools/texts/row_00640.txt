Fellow Argentinian Rojo said: 'I first met Angel with Argentina's national team. He was always a cool guy. We've got along well since the first time we met. He is young and so am I, so I've always had a good relationship with him. 'And here at United we are the only Argentinians, so we are almost always together. We're always talking, or sharing a tea [a type of tea in Argentina] or whatever. He is a great person.'

'There are players who have got tricks and can drop the shoulder to go past players, but he is so direct in his play. It is almost like Giggsy used to be in many ways. 'When he picks that ball up he can carry it and change direction pretty quickly, so it is very tough to defend against – especially if he is doing through the middle of the park.'

Louis van Gaal's side travel to League One's Preston on Monday, knowing that they're in for a stern test if they're to progress to the next round of the FA Cup. Having needed two ties to see off League Two's Cambridge United in the previous round, the Dutchman knows his team cannot afford to slip up against the tougher opposition. Despite coming under criticism in the past few weeks, United are still in good form and find themselves on a six-game unbeaten run in all competitions.

Robin van Persie and Marcus Rojo also made an appearance, along with their respective partners. Other Manchester United players who attended the party include Radamel Falcao, Wayne Rooney, and Juan Mata. The celebration was a much-needed break for the team, who have been under immense criticism after their slow start to the season. Manchester United boss, Louis van Gaal, has been under pressure, with calls for him to be sacked growing louder. The team's performances have been lackluster, with the team struggling to score goals and maintain possession.

In conclusion, the celebration of Angel di Maria's birthday is a reminder of the positive aspects of Manchester United, despite the team's on-field troubles.
