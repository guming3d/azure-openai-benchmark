In 2002 a previously unknown star stunned stargazers when it suddenly flared up to briefly become the brightest star in the sky. The star, V838 Monocerotis, produced a stellar flash so brilliant that scientists had never seen anything like it before - then, just as suddenly, it faded. A stellar flash like this was unprecedented because supernovas and novas typically expel matter out into space, often obscuring them from view. Scroll down for video . Poetry of heaven: Nasa has released an image of the 'light echo' produced by the glare from a star that was, for one brief shining moment, the brightest in the night sky . It is light from a stellar explosion echoing off dust surrounding the star. V838 Monocerotis produced enough energy in a brief flash to illuminate surrounding dust, like a spelunker taking a flash picture of the walls of an undiscovered cavern. The star presumably ejected the illuminated dust shells in previous outbursts. Light from the latest outburst travels to the dust and then is reflected to Earth. Because of this indirect path, the light arrives at Earth months after light from the star that traveled directly toward Earth. Now Nasa has released an artist's . impression, created using the Hubble Space Telescope, that appears to . show V838 expel material into space, but what we are actually seeing is an outwardly moving 'light echo' of the bright flash - about a million times solar luminosity - from 11 years ago. According to Nasa, in a light echo, light from the flash is reflected by successively more distant rings in the complex array of ambient interstellar dust that already surrounded the star. It is still not known what caused the flare, but theories include an eruption caused by helium eruptions as the star entered its death throes, the swallowing of planets by V838 or that V838 is a very massive supergiant that underwent a thermonuclear event. The expansion took only a couple of months, meaning that its speed was abnormal. A paper with contributions from the US Naval Observatory, the University of Arizona and the European Space Agency concluded: 'When combined with the high luminosity and unusual outburst behavior, these characteristics indicate that V838 Mon represents a hitherto unknown type of stellar outburst, for which we have no completely satisfactory physical explanation.' V838 Mon lies about 20,000 light years away toward the constellation of the unicorn (hence the name Monoceros), while the light echo in the image spans about six light years in diameter. It appears that the star is considerably more massive and luminous than . the Sun, perhaps five to ten times as big.

chatgpt: Astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope have captured stunning images of the "light echo" from a mysterious flare-up of a star. The event, which produced a million times the luminosity of our own sun, occurred in the galaxy NGC 6946, also known as the Fireworks Galaxy, located some 22 million light-years from Earth. While theories abound, scientists have yet to determine what caused the dramatic event. The phenomenon is known as a "light echo" because it occurs when light from a cosmic event is reflected by interstellar dust, creating an echo that can be seen from Earth. In this case, the light echoes are from the flare-up of a star, but it's not yet clear why it happened. One theory is that the event was caused by the explosion of a massive star, known as a supernova. However, the lack of a visible remnant of the explosion suggests that it may have been caused by a different, and as yet unknown, phenomenon. The images captured by the Hubble Space Telescope show a series of concentric rings of light, which are expanding outward from the location of the event. The rings are the result of the light bouncing off interstellar dust, creating an echo that is moving outward at the speed of light. The light echoes are providing astronomers with a unique opportunity to study the properties of the interstellar dust in the galaxy. By analyzing the way the light interacts with the dust, scientists can learn more about the composition and density of the dust and how it is distributed throughout the galaxy. The Hubble Space Telescope is one of the most powerful tools in astronomy, and has provided scientists with invaluable insights into the workings of the universe. Its ability to capture stunning images of cosmic events like this one has revolutionized our understanding of the cosmos, and has helped to fuel our curiosity about the mysteries of the universe. While the cause of the event captured in these images remains a mystery, it's clear that the universe is full of surprises, and that there is still so much we have yet to learn. As our technology advances, we'll continue to explore the cosmos and uncover its secrets, one discovery at a time.
