article: Millwall players will make history on Remembrance weekend when they run out against Brentford in a special camouflage strip in aid of injured troops. The Football League have granted Millwall special permission to wear the army colours as they raise money for Headley Court - the military rehabilitation centre in Leatherhead, Surrey. Headley Court treats injured members of the Armed Forces and the Lions will line up for the Championship clash with the centre's name across the front of the shirts after regular sponsors Euroferries agreed to the switch.

He told The Sun: 'It is fair to say I had a lump in my throat and my eyes may have been watering. But this again shows what Millwall is all about and, until I came here, I didn’t realise quite how much this club reaches out to the real things in life. 'I am bursting with pride that we’re supporting Headley Court, where people who have fought for our country with such loyalty, honesty and bravery are being cared for. Ian Holloway was full of passion when he read John McCrae's poem In Flanders Fields on the Millwall video . 'All of us at Millwall are proud to stand with them.' The club are looking to raise £20,000 and will be selling 1,500 of the £50 shirts with proceeds from each going to Headley Court.

chatgpt: Millwall Football Club is looking to raise £20,000 for a rehabilitation centre for injured troops. To achieve this goal, the Lions have made a unique and proactive decision to wear a special camouflage strip during their upcoming match against Brentford on Saturday.  The initiative was launched today, with the video for the kit release being launched, but it was not just the kit that caught the media's attention. Manager Ian Holloway was seen tearing up after recording a voice-over for the video launch of the kit. "I just want to do it right," said Holloway. "It's for such a great cause and I don't want to let anyone down."  The initiative is a part of The Royal British Legion’s ‘Sporting Remembers’ campaign, which calls on the nation's football clubs to commemorate their local community's contribution during the First World War. The Lions have heeded the call and are proud to use their resources to give back to the brave men and women who fought for their country. The kit will be available for pre-order starting Monday, and supporters are encouraged to take part in this great cause by buying a kit or just making a donation. The funds raised will go towards the Royal British Legion's efforts to provide aid and support to wounded soldiers, veterans, and their families.  Club officials and fans alike are excited to see the players take to the field in this stunning new camouflage kit. It is expected to attract the attention of fans and media alike and raise awareness of the cause. "We are proud to support this fantastic initiative and believe that our fans will be excited to show their support as well," said Club CEO Steve Kavanagh. This move by Millwall down a different path is a testament to the commitment and passion for the welfare of the country's military personnel. It's a powerful declaration of the club's dedication towards social and community responsibility. The fans' and club's support will go a long way in transforming the lives of soldiers who have sacrificed everything for their beloved country, and it sets a positive example for other teams to follow.
