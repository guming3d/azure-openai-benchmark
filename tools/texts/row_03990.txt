article: Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) -- A suicide bomber drove a car packed with explosives into a convoy carrying a Qatari delegation in Mogadishu Sunday, killing at least eight people and wounding seven, authorities and witnesses said. Farah Hassan, who witnessed the aftermath of the attack, said those killed were all bystanders at the busy intersection in Somalia's capital. Earlier reports about the attack said Somalia's interior minister was traveling in the convoy, but the minister's office said he was not there. Somali prime minister spokesman Ahmed Adan and District Commissioner Abdi Warsame said no one in the convoy was hurt in the attack. The radical Islamist group Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the bombing, and said six soldiers were killed and nine wounded. "The mujahideen have today carried out a martyrdom operation in Mogadishu, targeting Somali interior minister convoy," the militant group posted on a pro-Al-Shabaab website. Several principal roads in and around the capital were locked down by government troops in recent days amid threats by Al-Shabaab to launch deadly attacks. The site of Sunday's suicide bombing was just reopened a day ago. Emergency vehicles, sirens wailing, rushed to the gruesome scene, where incinerated bodies and body parts were strewn across the road. The wounded, some of them seriously injured, were rushed to the hospital. A bulldozer sifted through the rubble, which covered most of the street. "What have they done to us?" one woman wailed. The latest attack comes two days ahead of a conference on Somalia in London, where Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud is expected to present his plans to rebuild the military and the country as a whole, as well as solicit international support. Al-Shabaab has waged several recent attacks in Somalia. Last month, at least 10 heavily armed militants forced their way into a court building in Mogadishu, killing 29 people, sources said. In that attack, some assailants detonated explosives while others exchanged fire with government security officers, witnesses said. At least nine members of Al-Shabaab were also killed, the sources said. Somalia's president has called the uptick in strikes "nothing but a sign of desperation by the terrorists," saying the militants "are in complete decline." Somalia's government, backed by African Union peacekeepers, has been battling Islamist guerrillas for years. CNN's Nima Elbagir contributed to this report .

chatgpt: A suicide bombing in Somalia has claimed the lives of at least eight people, according to local officials. The attack took place on Saturday in the town of Galkayo, a hub for aid agencies and foreign workers in the region. The bomber detonated his explosives at a local government office where a delegation of officials had gathered. The group included representatives from the African Union, the United Nations, and other international bodies. The Somali interior minister, who was expected to attend the meeting, was not with the delegation at the time of the attack, his office confirmed. The Islamist militia Al-Shabaab quickly claimed responsibility for the bombing, the latest in a series of deadly attacks carried out by the group in Somalia. Al-Shabaab, which has strong ties to Al-Qaeda, has been fighting to establish an Islamic state in Somalia for more than a decade. The group has targeted government officials, aid workers, and civilians in its attacks. In recent months, it has stepped up its campaign of violence, with a series of bombings and raids across the country. The latest attack underscores the challenges facing Somalia's fragile government and the international community in stabilizing the country. Despite the presence of thousands of African Union troops and other international forces, Al-Shabaab has continued to mount attacks and control large parts of rural Somalia. The government has condemned the bombing and vowed to take tough action against the perpetrators. It has also called on the international community to provide more support for its efforts to combat terrorism and stabilize the country. The attack comes as Somalia struggles to contain a deadly outbreak of COVID-19, with thousands of new cases reported in recent weeks. Aid workers and health officials have warned that the country's health system is ill-equipped to handle a major outbreak, making the situation even more precarious. The bombing has also raised concerns about the safety of aid workers and other international staff in the region. Many agencies have scaled back their operations in recent months due to the threat of violence, limiting their ability to provide much-needed assistance to vulnerable communities. Despite the challenges, however, the government and its international partners remain committed to working towards a more stable and prosperous Somalia. The attack is a tragic reminder of the threats they face, but it has also strengthened their resolve to overcome them.
