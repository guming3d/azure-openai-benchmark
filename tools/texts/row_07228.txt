Coral's current favourite to win Bake Off at 3/1 is grandmother of eight, Nancy Birtwhisle . The keen baker, 60, from Barton-Upon-Humber, whipped up her incredible cake using a recipe that put even McVitie's to . shame. It consisted of 'vanilla sponge, sandwiched with Cointreau orange jelly topped . with dark chocolate, and handmade orange pastilles.' She even used a homemade cake guillotine to ensure precise symmetry. The former practice manager at Central Surgery in Barton discovered a passion for baking after retiring seven years ago. She was selected as a contestant for this year's series after a failed application last year, and is one of 12 amateurs looking to impress judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood.

Hot on her heels to win the baking contest, which has moved from BBC2 to BBC1, is Richard the builder at 7/2. Youngest contestant ever at just 17, Martha Collison is next with odds of 5/1. Meanwhile, poor Claire Goodwin was the first to exit, Coral now have the colourfully attired Jordan Cox at 5/4 as the next baker to leave as he failed to impress the judges. It wouldn't be a Bake Off without tears and tantrums and following the debut episode, Coral is offering odds of 2/1 of at least three contestants welling up by the third episode. Although it's the baking disaster cake lovers fear the most, the phrase 'soggy bottom' comes a close second. It was used in jest last night but Coral offers odds at 7/4 that it will be used to describe a contestant's creation by the third episode. Dressed in a splendid floral design for episode one, It's odds on at 1/2 that Mary Berry will sport a floral blazer at least four times throughout the series. Coral's John Hill says: 'The new series, although predictable, continues to receive rave reviews and shows no signs of falling flat, promising the usual helping of one-liners from Mel and Sue and dollops of innuendo from Paul and Mary, but all eyes will be on the contestants' clever creations over the coming weeks. 'At this stage we're backing Nancy to win, although as we all know, this can easily change with a "soggy bottom"!'

chatgpt: The nation's favourite baking show, The Great British Bake Off, returned to our screens last week, and already fans are speculating over who will be crowned the winner of the competition. One contestant who has captured the hearts of viewers is a 60-year-old grandmother from Barton-Upon-Humber, who has been tipped as the favourite to win. The talented baker, who has 8 grandchildren, stole the show in the latest round by taking the prized Star Baker title for her delicious 'Jaffa cakes', wowing judges Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith with her technical ability and attention to detail. Despite facing stiff competition from other talented bakers, the grandmother's consistently impressive bakes have made her an early frontrunner in the competition. Her youthful enthusiasm and mastery of baking techniques has endeared her to audiences, who have dubbed her the 'Queen of Jaffa Cakes'. In an interview with British Bake Off Magazine, the grandmother revealed that she first discovered her passion for baking as a child, when she would help her mother in the kitchen. Since then, she has honed her skills by baking for her family and friends, and has now decided to take her love of baking to the next level by competing in the prestigious baking competition. Despite the pressure of the competition, the grandmother is determined to remain focused and true to her own baking style. She prides herself on using traditional baking methods and ingredients, and aims to create simple, classic bakes that showcase the flavour and texture of the ingredients. Fans of the show have already taken to social media to express their admiration for the talented baker, with many predicting that she will go on to win the competition. Some have praised her for her calm and focused approach, while others have noted her outstanding technical ability and attention to detail. The grandmother's Jaffa Cakes were described as "perfectly formed" by the judges, who were impressed by her ability to nail the notoriously difficult bake. Paul Hollywood, in particular, was full of praise for the grandmother, describing her as a "hidden gem" who has the potential to go all the way. Despite her success in the competition so far, the grandmother remains modest and is quick to credit her fellow bakers for their own impressive bakes. She is pleased to have made it this far in the competition, but is not letting herself get carried away with the possibility of winning. With several weeks of intense baking still to come, it remains to be seen whether the grandmother of eight will be crowned the winner of The Great British Bake Off. One thing is for sure, however - she has already won the hearts of audiences across the UK, and her delicious bakes will be remembered long after the competition is over.  The Great British Bake Off is aired on Wednesdays at 8pm on BBC1, so make sure you don't miss out on the chance to watch this talented baker in action!
