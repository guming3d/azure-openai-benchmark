Not lovin' it: Student Sarah Finch has been handed £3,000 compensation after she was sacked for sprinkling too much chocolate on a McFlurry . It was just a small favour for a colleague but it ended up getting Sarah Finch the sack from McDonald’s. She had sprinkled a generous helping of chocolate on a 99p McFlurry dessert after her workmate said ‘make it a nice one’. However, her bosses at the fast food chain accused the 19-year-old of gross misconduct for giving away food. Yesterday Miss Finch, who had been called an ‘exceptional employee’ in appraisals, was awarded £3,000 compensation after taking her employers to an employment tribunal. After the case centred on the branch in  Carmarthen, west Wales, was settled out of court, she said in a statement: ‘I was accused of stealing food. ‘The matter was trivial, in that I provided a fellow employee, who was purchasing a dessert, a  generous sprinkling of chocolate pieces. 'There is no standard for such measures – they are always imprecise and will vary among customers. ‘My colleague had asked me “make it a nice one”. So the measure I gave erred on the side of more than – rather than less than – the mean.’ Miss Finch, of Kidwelly, had earned £180 a week when she worked at the outlet run by franchise company Lonetree for 18 months while studying. The student, who is now doing A-levels in chemistry, physics and biology, won the payout after conciliation service Acas was called in. Part of the settlement is that she will receive a good reference. Comments by her former managers had included: ‘You are very polite and friendly to all customers, even when they can be trying. Your smile is very welcoming.’ Another said: ‘You have worked hard and your positive friendly attitude has been recognised.’ Payout: The McDonalds restaurant in Carmarthen, west Wales, where Sarah Finch had worked for 18 months . 'Trivial': Sarah Finch was sacked for sprinkling too much chocolate on a 99p McFlurry . But Ron Mounsey, managing director of Lonetree, had backed the decision to sack Miss Finch. At the time, he wrote to her mother Tessa saying: ‘Your daughter has admitted giving away food without receiving payment. This is classed as gross misconduct as per my Employee Handbook, the consequence is dismissal. ‘You may feel it is trivial, but with 740 employees in my business, if my team were to overlook such incidents, then it would quickly become a free-for-all. ‘There are notices in every one of my staff rooms reminding employees of this policy as well as the Employee Handbook.’ Mrs Finch, an accountant, said at the time of her daughter’s dismissal that the accusation of theft was ‘a terrible stain on her character’. A Lonetree spokesman said: ‘This has been resolved. No admission of liability was made.’

chatgpt: Student Sarah Finch has been fired by a McDonald's branch in Carmarthen, Wales, after being accused of gross misconduct. The 19-year-old was accused of giving away free food, resulting in her dismissal from the restaurant chain. According to sources, the bosses at McDonald's had previously described Finch as an "exceptional employee." However, the accusations of breach of trust quickly led to her termination from the job. Finch was reportedly fired for "gross misconduct" after allegedly giving away food worth £12 ($15) to colleagues and friends. A statement by McDonald's confirmed the reason for the dismissal and emphasized the company's strict policy on employee behavior. "Employees are not permitted to give away free food or drinks in breach of McDonald's food safety and hygiene policies. This is considered gross misconduct, and the employee involved has been dismissed," the statement read. The incident has generated a lot of reactions on social media, with many expressing outrage at McDonald's decision to fire Finch. Several Twitter users have criticized the company's actions, describing them as harsh and disproportionate. Some have speculated that the firing was part of a wider trend of businesses cracking down on employee misconduct in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Others have suggested that the company may have been looking for ways to cut costs and streamline operations. Meanwhile, Finch has not spoken publicly about the incident but has received support from her friends and family. Her father, John Finch, expressed disappointment at the decision to terminate her employment. "She has always been an extremely loyal and hardworking employee, and to be dismissed without warning is extremely unfair," he said. The incident has also led to renewed calls for workers' rights and better protections for employees. Many have pointed to the prevalence of precarious work and zero-hour contracts in the fast-food industry, which can leave workers vulnerable to exploitation and mistreatment. Despite the backlash, McDonald's has stood by its decision to fire Finch, insisting that the company's policies must be upheld. "McDonald's has strict policies in place to ensure the safety and quality of our food, and we take any breaches of these policies extremely seriously. We regret that we had to take these measures, but we must always put our customers' health and safety first," the statement concluded.
