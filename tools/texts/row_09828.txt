article: As many women know only too well, finding a dress that fits like a glove is no easy task. But a new dress, created using a 3D printer, may be the answer to every woman's style woes. A design studio have used 3D printing technology to create an innovative dress customised to a woman’s body. Scroll down for video . High tech fashion: A design studio have used 3D printing technology to create an innovative dress customised to a woman's body - but making the garment takes 48 hours and costs £1,900 . The dress, which costs a staggering £1,900 ($3,000) to print, features 2,279 printed panels interconnected by 3,316 hinges. Creators Nervous System call it a ‘4D dress’ as, like fabric, the printed garment can go from a compressed object to its intended shape. Jessica Rosenkrantz, co-founder and creative director, revealed the garment took approximately 48 hours to print. Future of fashion? The dress features 2,279 printed panels interconnected by 3,316 hinges and the printed garment can go from a compressed object to its intended shape . Lengthy process: The dress is printed using a process called Selective Laser Sintering that uses a laser to fuse together nylon powder, leaving unmelted powder in between all of the gap spaces . The company, based in Massachusetts, USA, have also created a smartphone and tablet app, which helps users to manipulate their dresses. Using the app, the pattern, style and flexibility of the dress can all be changed. Speaking about her work, Jessica said: 'I’m very interested in a future where garments are more personal and customised. 'It is printed using a process called Selective Laser Sintering that uses a laser to fuse together nylon powder, leaving unmelted powder in between all of the gap spaces. 'This extra powder falls away after printing which is what allows us to print complex interlocking mechanisms that work right out of the printer. 'Body scanning and new design and fabrication techniques are opening up more possibilities in this direction. 'More dresses are already on the way.' In the studio: Creators Nervous System call it a 4D dress as, like fabric, the printed garment can go from a compressed object to its intended shape . Time-consuming:  Body scanning and new design and fabrication techniques are opening up more possibilities in this direction, say founders, who believe this is the future of fashion . Forward-thinking: The company have also created a smartphone and tablet app, which helps users to manipulate their dresses.

chatgpt: Innovation in the fashion industry is constantly evolving, with designers always pushing the boundaries of what is possible. Recently, a design studio in the United States has taken things to a whole new level by using 3D printing technology to create an innovative dress that is customised to a woman's body shape. The garment, created by the design studio, features an impressive 2,279 printed panels that are interconnected by 3,316 hinges. The finished result creates a striking and futuristic look, that is unlike anything seen before in the fashion industry. Not only is the dress aesthetically impressive, but it also shows a great deal of functionality. The 3D printed panels are designed to conform to a woman's body shape, providing a snug and comfortable fit. This customisation is made possible by the intricate design process that the design team undertook. Through the use of 3D scanning and digital modelling, the team were able to create a dress that was bespoke to the wearer's unique physique. As the team behind the creation explained, this is just the first of many similar garments that they plan to produce. They believe that 3D printing technology has immense potential, not only in the fashion industry, but in many other areas as well, and they are excited to explore its possibilities further. Indeed, 3D printing technology has been a major disruptive force in many industries, from manufacturing to medicine. It enables designers to create bespoke objects, whether they be prototypes, consumer products, or even human organs. In the fashion industry, 3D printing technology is still in its infancy, but the potential is huge. It allows designers to create garments that are far more complex and intricate than those that can be made through traditional manufacturing methods. Moreover, by creating customised garments that fit perfectly to a woman's body shape, 3D printed clothing could revolutionise the way we think about fashion. No longer will we be limited to off-the-rack clothes that are designed to fit the average person. Instead, we will all be able to wear clothes that are specifically tailored to our unique shapes and sizes. The dress created by the design studio is just the beginning. With more and more designers embracing 3D printing technology, we can expect to see a wealth of amazing and innovative fashion creations in the years to come.
