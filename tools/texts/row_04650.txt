A map featuring alternative names for the countries of Europe based on Google's autocomplete search function predictions . Map makers have been having fun replacing place names with their online alter egos to create alternative maps of the world. They include a map of Europe by Buzzfeed.com, with some of the substitutions appearing to be apt descriptions, such as Iceland being replaced by 'bankrupt' and Sweden by 'expensive'. France becomes 'bacon', Britain is labelled 'a trap' while Italian food means the country is turned into 'Eataly'. However, others such as Ukraine being 'weak', Estonia swapping with 'poor' and Albania making way for 'bad', may not be looked upon with such good humour by patriots there. The website also produced a map of New York, featuring 'state of mind' instead of Chelsea, 'filled with high rollers' in place of Upper East Side, 'dangerous' filling in for Spanish Harlem, and 'more liberal' appearing where Uppper West Side should be. The maps were inspired by Matt Shirley, from Flipcollective.com, who used Yahoo autocomplete to draw up a 'United States Is...' map.

'Racist' appears instead of Arizona, 'stupid' comes in for Idaho and 'flatter than a pancake' replaces Kansas, in his creation, while florida makes way for 'crazy', Tennessee is replaced by 'nice but it ain't Texas' and Rhode Island is helpfully swapped with 'not an island'.

chatgpt: In an effort to offer a more nuanced understanding of geography, a number of alternative maps have been produced that replace place names with descriptions that are most often searched for on the internet. These descriptions, which can range from the accurate to the bizarre and offensive, are an interesting reflection of how people see the world around them. This novel approach to map-making has been applied to several locations around the world, including Europe, New York's Manhattan, and the United States. The resulting maps are a fascinating study in how the internet shapes our perceptions of place. For example, the new map of Europe shows that the most commonly searched-for term for Ireland is "pubs", while Portugal is apparently associated with "sardines". Meanwhile, Estonia is described as "cyber", a nod to the country's digital prowess, and Sweden is tagged as "neutral". Turning to New York's Manhattan, the new map reveals that Central Park is the most searched-for location. Broadway is another hotspot, along with Times Square and the Empire State Building. This suggests that tourists who visit the city are more likely to be interested in its iconic landmarks and attractions than the more mundane aspects of day-to-day life. Finally, the new map of the United States shows that "poverty" is the most common search term for Mississippi, while "guns" is the top result for Texas. Meanwhile, California is associated with "Hollywood", and Alaska is labeled "wilderness". Again, these associations offer an intriguing insight into how internet users perceive different parts of the country. While some of the descriptions thrown up by the internet may seem odd or even offensive, they offer an important reminder of the vast diversity of perspectives and backgrounds that make up the modern world. This can be seen in the new map of Europe, where different parts of the continent are associated with everything from art to beer. Ultimately, these alternative maps may not offer a literal representation of the places they depict, but they do shed light on the fascinating ways in which people engage with geography and the world around them. Whether we are searching for tourist attractions in New York or learning more about different cultural traditions in Europe, our online searches reveal much about our interests, passions, and priorities as individuals and as a society.
