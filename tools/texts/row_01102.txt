article: A senior staffer for a Republican congressman scolded President Obama's daughters for dressing like "they deserve a spot at a bar" and told them to "try showing a little class" in a Facebook post that has since gone viral, drawing her heavy criticism and prompting calls for her dismissal. Elizabeth Lauten, communications director for Tennessee Rep. Steve Fincher and a former communications staffer for the Republican National Committee, wrote the screed against the First Daughters in a Facebook post on Thanksgiving. In it, she scolded them for their clothes and bored looks during Wednesday's turkey pardoning, and took aim at the President and First Lady for failing to "respect their positions." "Dear Sasha and Malia: I get you're both in those awful teen years, but you're a part of the First Family, try showing a little class. At least respect the part you play," Lauten wrote in the post. "Then again, your mother and father don't respect their positions very much, or the nation for that matter," she added. "So I'm guessing you're coming up a little short in the 'good role model' department." While Sasha and Malia Obama, 13 and 16 years old, respectively, indeed both looked less than enthusiastic to accompany their father to the Turkey pardoning ceremony on Wednesday, their typically teenage glowers were met with amusement by multiple media outlets. Lauten, however, had some advice for the First Daughters, imploring them in the Facebook post to "stretch yourself...rise to the occasion" and "act like being in the White House matters to you." "Dress like you deserve respect, not a spot at a bar. And certainly don't make faces during televised, public events," she concluded. The post was tweeted out by a reporter for African-American media outlet The Root and quickly picked up traction across social media, prompting heavy criticism across the web. One Lauten detractor launched a petition on Change.org, a popular progressive organizing tool, calling for Lauten to be fired. Hours after the post went viral, Lauten returned to Facebook to publish an apology, admitting she "quickly judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teenager." "After many hours of prayer, talking to my parents, and re-reading my words online I can see more clearly just how hurtful my words were. Please know, those judgmental feelings truly have no place in my heart," she said. Lauten also pledged to "learn and grow...from this experience." Neither Lauten, her chief of staff Jessica Carter nor Fincher responded to requests for comment via email. The First Daughters, meanwhile, took an outing with their father to a local bookstore in Washington on Saturday, to highlight Small Business Saturday.

chatgpt: A spokesperson for the Republican Party, Elizabeth Lauten, is receiving an intense backlash for remarks she made on Facebook about President Obama's daughters. Ms. Lauten criticized the dress and demeanor of Sasha and Malia Obama, urging them to show more respect for their father. In a Facebook post that has since been taken down, Ms. Lauten expressed her disapproval of the Obama daughters' fashion choices at the annual Turkey Pardon event. Sasha and Malia were wearing knee-length skirts and sweaters that were deemed to be too short and too tight by Ms. Lauten. In the post, she chastised the teenagers, saying that they should "try showing a little class" and "act like being in the White House matters to you." Ms. Lauten also took issue with perceived disrespect shown by the girls towards their father, President Obama. She claimed that Sasha and Malia were rolling their eyes during the event and urged them to "respect the White House" and their father. The comments have been met with significant backlash, with many criticizing Ms. Lauten for attacking the Obama girls, who are not public figures and should not be subjected to such scrutiny. The comments were also criticized for being hypocritical, as Ms. Lauten's own social media history includes explicit language and controversial opinions. The White House has not commented on the controversy, but many politicians, including several Republicans, have condemned Ms. Lauten's comments. The Republican National Committee released a statement saying that Ms. Lauten's remarks "were not appropriate and the RNC has asked her to resign." Ms. Lauten has since apologized for her comments, saying that she had "overstepped [her] bounds" and that her comments were "hurtful." She has also resigned from her position as a spokesperson for the Republican Party. The controversy over Ms. Lauten's comments highlights the ongoing struggle to balance political discourse and personal privacy in the age of social media. While politicians and public figures are often subject to intense scrutiny, their families should be off-limits, especially when it comes to comments about their appearance or behavior. Many have also pointed out the double standard in criticizing the Obama girls' fashion choices, while male politicians' children, such as the Bush sisters and the Romney boys, have not been subjected to the same criticism. Overall, Ms. Lauten's comments have sparked a necessary conversation about respecting the children of public figures and the importance of being mindful of the words we use in public discourse.
