article: Love really is lovelier the second time around. Couples on their second marriage are happier and less likely to get divorced, a report claims. According to the Marriage Foundation, 45 per cent of marriages between first-timers are destined for the divorce courts. But just 31 per cent of second weddings will end in failure. And husbands who are tying the knot for the second time are more likely to find happiness. TV presenters Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan, who have been married for 26 years, are an example of successful second-timers . The relationships think-tank used figures from the Office for National Statistics to find out which marriages stand the test of time. It found those on their second union benefit from age and experience, and are more ready to commit. Rather than sliding into a marriage without much thought they will have carefully weighed the pros and cons. Harry Benson, who wrote the report for the Marriage Foundation, said: ‘Overall, second marriages do better because couples who get married for the second time are invariably older than those marrying for the first time. Couples on their second marriage are more likely to stay together as they benefit from the experiences of the past . ‘One possibility is that higher age is a proxy for higher income. Higher income acts as a buffer against some of the everyday difficulties faced by most couples. ‘Another possibility is that higher age means there are fewer young children from prior relationships. ‘And fewer second marriages for men are subject to the social and family pressures that lead into some first marriages. Hence men tend to do better second time round.’ He added: ‘The good news is that couples wishing to marry second time round no longer need to be put off by doom-laden statistics. Second marriages generally do OK.’ Relationship expert Dr Pam Spurr said that while previous statistics have shown that second marriages break down more quickly, maturity may well aid a second marriage. She added the second marriages can be particularly problematic when there are children from both previous marriages. And Relate counsellor Paula Hall pointed out that money can be tighter in a second marriage due to divorce settlements. But she added: ‘People in second marriages seem to have more insight and self-awareness. Having gone through divorce and separation, there can be more motivation to work through problems and save the marriage.’ TV presenters Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan, who have been married for 26 years, are an example of successful second-timers. Madeley had a brief marriage in his 20s but has told how he and his first wife were never well suited.

chatgpt: Marriage Foundation, a UK-based organization aimed at promoting healthier and happier marriages, has released new research that suggests nearly half of all first marriages end in divorce. According to the study, 45 per cent of first marriages ultimately fail, with a range of reasons cited for their breakdowns. Common factors include financial strain, infidelity, and simply growing apart over time. However, there is some good news for those who do decide to remarry. The research showed that only 31 per cent of second marriages end in divorce, indicating that couples who choose to try again are often more successful the second time around. Experts say the reason for this is largely due to age and experience. Second-time spouses are often older and wiser than their younger counterparts, and have a better understanding of what it takes to make a marriage work. They also may have had more time to reflect on what they want and need in a partner, and are less likely to compromise on those requirements. “Second marriages are much more likely to work because the individuals involved have learned from past experiences,” said Harry Benson, Research Director at Marriage Foundation. “They know what they want and don’t want, know how to compromise, and have a more realistic view of what marriage entails.” There are also some factors that can make second marriages more difficult, such as blending families or dealing with stepchildren, but overall experts say that these challenges can be overcome with a little patience and understanding. For those who are considering getting married for the second time or beyond, there are some things they can do to increase their chances of success. One tip is to take things slow and ensure that both partners are on the same page before tying the knot. This means discussing important issues like finances, parenting styles, and future goals to ensure that both parties are in agreement. It’s also important to seek out premarital counseling or therapy, which can help couples identify potential issues and work through them before they become larger problems. “Second marriages have a lot of potential for success, but it’s important to be intentional and take things slow,” said Benson. “By being honest with yourself and your partner, and working together to overcome challenges, you can create a happy and healthy partnership that lasts a lifetime.”
