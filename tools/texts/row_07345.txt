article: WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The Department of Homeland Security is now collecting scans of all 10 fingerprints from foreign travelers entering the United States at Dulles International Airport, and plans to extend the program to all international airports in the country by the end of next year. The program -- known as United States Visitor and Immigration Status Indicator Technology, or US-VISIT -- had previously used only two fingerprints. The 10-print system gives the United States the ability to compare fingerprints of travelers with criminal and terrorist databases compiled by the FBI, the Defense Department and others. The new 10-print system was rolled out in late November at Dulles. Speaking at an event at the airport Monday, DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff touted the new technology: "We rely on biometrics, unique physical characteristics like fingerprints, to keep dangerous people out of the United States and at the same time to keep the lines moving so that travel is fast and convenient for legitimate citizens and visitors." Chertoff said the two-fingerprint version of the program, which began in 2004, has already been successful, claiming that the program had stopped "almost 2,000 criminals and immigrant violators based on their fingerprints alone." Canadians and Mexicans using government-issued identification cards are exempt from the program. Privacy advocates such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center claim the system puts personal information at risk. A July 2007 Government Accountability Office report found that "systems supporting the US-VISIT program have significant information security control weaknesses that place sensitive and personally identifiable information at increased risk of unauthorized and possibly undetected disclosure and modification, misuse and destruction." DHS insists that there have been no privacy breaches in the US-VISIT program. Chertoff played down risks. "Moving to 10 fingerprints is completely consistent with, and in fact enhances, our ability to protect," he said. "We view privacy as a fundamental human right and preserving it is an integral part of our mission." Travel and tourism groups fear that more barriers to international travel will make foreigners less likely to visit the United States. Discover America Partnership, a trade group representing the tourism industry, is cautiously supporting the program, but urges a greater effort by the United States to make foreign travelers aware of the program. "While reasonable, we must also recognize that the 10-finger scan technology may be perceived as a barrier to entry," said Geoff Freeman, executive director of Discover America Partnership, in a news release. "We must balance this and other barriers with clear communications and a welcoming message." E-mail to a friend .

chatgpt: The US government has rolled out a new 10-print system at Dulles International Airport to enhance security measures for international travelers. The initiative, known as US-VISIT, had previously relied on the collection of only two fingerprints from foreign nationals arriving in the United States. According to government officials, the new 10-print system will increase the accuracy of biometric data collection, making it easier to identify potential security threats. With the ability to capture more fingerprints, officials believe the system will enhance national security efforts by improving screening processes and reducing the risk of fraudulent identifications. The 10-print system was initially implemented at Dulles just last month and will begin extending to all international airports across the nation by the end of 2008. Travelers can expect to have all ten fingers scanned upon arrival, a process that takes only a few extra seconds. While some travelers have expressed concerns about the increased fingerprint collection, government officials have assured the public that the biometric data collected is solely used for security purposes and will not be shared with other agencies or entities. Additionally, data collected will be subject to strict privacy policies to prevent unauthorized access or use. According to a statement from the Department of Homeland Security, "the 10-print system is part of our ongoing commitment to securing our borders and protecting the American people. By enhancing our biometric data collection capabilities, we can continue to improve our ability to detect and prevent potential security threats." Travelers entering the United States will not be the only individuals affected by the new policy. U.S. citizens are also subject to the 10-print system when applying for certain government programs, such as Global Entry, which expedites the customs and immigration process for frequent international travelers. Despite potential privacy concerns, many security experts have praised the new system for its ability to enhance national security. With increasing threats to national security globally, many believe that the new biometric system offers an added layer of protection against potential terrorism and other security risks. As the 10-print system continues to roll out across the nation, travelers can expect to see improvements in the customs and immigration process. With enhanced biometric data collection, officials can more effectively screen and identify potential security threats, making travel safer for everyone.
