article: (CNET)  -- General Electric plans to give its solar business a charge in two years with the introduction of panels with the same solar cell material used by industry cost leader First Solar. General Energy is developing a solar energy product aimed at utility and commercial customers. In 2011, the energy giant expects to produce solar panels made with cadmium telluride, a thin-film solar cell material, said Michael Idelchik, vice president of advanced technologies at GE Global Research at the EmTech conference here on Wednesday. The company now sells solar panels that use silicon solar cells, but its long-term bet is on thin-film and specifically cadmium telluride because it offers the cheapest cost per watt, he said. Last year, GE's energy division took a majority stake in Golden, Colorado-based PrimeStar Solar, for its cadmium telluride cell technology. GE is now developing a product around that aimed at utility and commercial customers. Solar at GE is a relatively small part of its sprawling energy portfolio, which covers everything from nuclear power plants to natural gas turbines. But GE expects that solar has the potential to grow rapidly, as its multi-billion dollar wind business has done over the past five years. "Solar is definitely the next wind for us. It's not there yet but it's moving very rapidly," said Idelchik. Solar is more expensive than wind right now, but GE expects that renewable energy mandates will help drive growth and bring costs down, he said. Thin-film solar cells offer lower production costs than the incumbent silicon because thin-film cells use far less material. Over the past five years, several solar companies have formed to make thin-film cells from a combination copper, indium, gallium, and selenide (CIGS), which are still not in the market in high volumes. GE's cells will be made from a compound of cadmium and tellurium. Silicon cells are durable and more efficient at converting sunlight to electricity than thin-film solar cells with the most efficient commercial silicon cells over 20 percent. But GE Research projects that it can boost the efficiency of cadmium telluride to 12 percent and potentially higher, Idelchik said. "We are excited about it because it can produce in diffuse light," he said. "The module (panel) life is 20 years -- that's what the customer wants. It has the right production costs and right efficiency target." Asked how its cadmium telluride products will differ from First Solar's, Idelchik said that GE's device would be more "flexible for customers." During his presentation, Idelchik said that GE is looking at ways at managing an entire solar array in a large installation built by a utility or commercial customer. After his talk, he said that GE is developing technology to recycle the solar cell material, as cadmium is a very toxic if it enters the environment. Â© 2009 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

chatgpt: General Electric (GE) has announced a significant shift in their approach to solar energy, as the company moves away from traditional silicon solar cells and towards a new thin-film material. The move comes as part of GE's commitment to reducing the cost of solar energy while maintaining high levels of efficiency. According to the company, the decision to switch to a thin-film material was based on an analysis of the production costs and efficiency targets for solar cells. GE concluded that thin-film material offered the lowest cost per watt, making it a more practical choice in terms of cost-effectiveness. The thin-film material that GE has chosen is known as Cadmium Telluride, which is said to be both more efficient and more cost-effective than traditional silicon solar cells. This material has been used by a number of other companies in the past, but GE believes that their technology will allow for even greater efficiency and cost savings. One of the key advantages of Cadmium Telluride is that it can be applied to a wide range of surfaces, which makes it ideal for use in a variety of different applications. For example, it can be used to make flexible solar panels that can be rolled up and transported easily, or it can be used to cover large areas of roof space on commercial buildings. In addition to the benefits in terms of cost and efficiency, GE is also developing technology to recycle the thin-film material used in their solar panels. This will help to reduce waste and ensure that the company's products are as environmentally-friendly as possible. Many experts have welcomed GE's decision to switch to Cadmium Telluride, stating that this is a major step forward for the solar energy industry. By using this material, GE will be able to make solar energy more accessible and affordable for a wider range of consumers and businesses. However, there are still some concerns about the environmental impact of Cadmium Telluride, as the material contains toxic heavy metals that can be harmful if not disposed of properly. In response, GE has stated that it is committed to developing safe and environmentally-friendly ways of producing and disposing of their solar panels. Overall, the shift towards thin-film material represents a significant change for GE and the solar energy industry as a whole. With their innovative technology and commitment to sustainability, GE is poised to make a major impact on the way that we generate and consume energy in the years to come.
