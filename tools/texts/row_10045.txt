article: LASHKAR GAH, Afghanistan (CNN)  -- Toiling in what is the opium capital of the world, farmers in southern Afghanistan are swapping out their poppy plants for wheat crops. A farmer harvests wheat in a field on the outskirts of Kabul, Afghanistan, last summer. The farmers are participating in programs sponsored by the U.S. Agency for International Development, which is offering seeds, fertilizers and improved irrigation to the region in an effort to stop poppy crops and, ultimately, the production of opium and heroin. Observers have noticed a significant decline in the opium trade in Afghanistan, with the number of poppy-free provinces increasing from 13 in 2007 to 18 in 2008, according to a U.N. report released last year. Opium cultivation in the country, which has 34 provinces, dropped by about 20 percent in a year, the U.N. reported in August. "It's a challenge to deliver assistance in a war zone -- you can hear fighter jets flying above us right now," said Rory Donohoe, a USAID development officer. "At the end of the day, what we found is successful is that we work in areas that we can work," he told CNN in a recent interview in Helmand province. "We come to places like this demonstration farm where Afghans can come here to a safe environment, get training, pick up seeds and fertilizer, then go back to districts of their own."

Many of Afghanistan's northern and eastern provinces have already benefited from USAID alternative farming programs, which have doled out more than $22 million to nearly 210,000 Afghans to build or repair 435 miles (700 kilometers) of roads and some 2,050 miles (3,300 kilometers) of irrigation and drainage canals. Giving Afghan farmers improved access to markets and improved irrigation is successfully weaning them away from poppy production, according to officials at USAID. Over the years, opium and heroin -- both derivatives of the poppy -- have served as a major source of revenue for the insurgency, most notably the Taliban movement that once ruled Afghanistan. "If you can just help the people of Afghanistan in this way, the fighting will go away," said Abdul Qadir, a farmer in Lashkar Gah. "The Taliban and other enemies of the country will also disappear."

chatgpt: USAID (United States Agency for International Development) is offering assistance to Afghan farmers in the form of seeds and other resources to encourage them to switch from growing poppy plants to wheat. Poppy plants are used to produce opium and heroin, which has been a significant source of revenue for the Taliban. The agency is trying to help Afghanistan move away from poppy production and reduce its dependence on the drug trade. The goal is also to encourage farmers to cultivate wheat, which is a staple crop in Afghanistan and could provide a sustainable source of income for them. In a statement, the USAID emphasized the need to support Afghan farmers and give them alternative ways to make a living. The organization is aware that many farmers have no other option than growing poppy plants, as it's extremely profitable and is the only way they can feed their families.  Apart from providing seeds to farmers, the agency is also offering training on modern farming techniques and technologies that can help them grow wheat in a more efficient and sustainable way. This includes lessons on crop rotation, soil management, and pest control. USAID's efforts have been successful so far in reducing poppy production in some areas of Afghanistan. However, there's still a long way to go, and more support is needed to ensure that farmers have access to all the resources they need to switch from poppy cultivation to other crops. Reducing opium and heroin production is crucial as it directly impacts the Taliban's revenue. The group has been using this source of income to finance its operations and spread its influence across the country. By encouraging farmers to switch to wheat, the USAID aims to weaken the Taliban's hold on power and promote a sustainable future for the Afghan people. Afghanistan remains one of the top producers of opium in the world, despite efforts to reduce its production. USAID's efforts could go a long way in changing that by empowering Afghan farmers with tools and skills needed to grow economically viable crops such as wheat.
