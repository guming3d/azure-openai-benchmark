article: A leech has been found to be able to survive after being submerged in liquid nitrogen. Ozobranchus jantseanus, a parasite found inside freshwater turtles, can be successfully reanimated after exposure to an astonishing -196°C for 24 hours. It can also survive in temperatures of -90°C for nearly three years. The Ozobranchus jantseanus, a leech that can survive a day in -196C . The discovery was made by a team of Japanese scientists who found a still-living leech attached to a frozen turtle. Most organisms expire after freezing because of the damage caused by the water in their cells when it freezes. The team are now trying to unlock why the Ozobranchus jantseanus is able to survive something that is so devastating to other creatures. It could help unlock humanity's grasp of cryopreservation, where cells, whole tissues, or any other substances susceptible to damage caused by chemical reactivity or time are preserved by cooling to sub-zero temperatures. Suspended animation is the slowing of life processes by external means without killing the organism. Breathing, heartbeat, and other involuntary functions may still occur, but they can only be detected using electronic equipment. Extreme cold can be used to slow an individual's functions, a process known as cryonics. Cryopreservation freezes organisms using liquid nitrogen that will preserve it until reanimation. Two-celled embryos have been kept in suspended animation for as long as 13 years. Extreme temperature: A flower frozen in liquid nitrogen and smashed . 'Ozobranchid leeches have a mysterious mechanism to prevent freezing. I want to get to the heart of the matter,' researcher Takahiro Kikawada said, reported The Asahi Shimbun. The research, published in published in peer-reviewed science journal PLOS One, states: 'This finding is particularly interesting because the leech can survive these temperatures without any acclimation period or pretreatment. 'It is unlikely that O. jantseanus would encounter similar freeze-thaw cycles in its natural environment of so it is suggested that the cold tolerance observed in this species has not arisen in response to some ecological need or that it is an environmental adaptation. 'Rather, it is likely that this cryotolerant ability has arisen in response to some as yet unclarified adaptation.' Liquid nitrogen is nitrogen in a liquid state at an extremely low temperature. At atmospheric pressure, liquid nitrogen boils at −196°C and is a cryogenic fluid that can cause rapid freezing on contact with living tissue. When appropriately insulated from ambient heat, liquid nitrogen can be stored and transported, for example in vacuum flasks. Nitrogen was first liquefied at the Jagiellonian University on 15 April 1883 by Polish physicists, Zygmunt Wroblewski and Karol Olszewski.

chatgpt: In a groundbreaking discovery, scientists in Japan have found that a parasitic leech can survive immersion in liquid nitrogen. The leech was discovered inside a frozen turtle, and this finding has the potential to revolutionize the field of cryogenics. Cryogenics is the study of the production and effects of low temperatures, and has been a topic of interest for scientists for some time. The ability to preserve living organisms through a process of freezing at extremely low temperatures has long been the subject of scientific inquiry. The discovery of a surviving leech inside a frozen turtle has breathed new life into the study of cryogenics, and sheds light on how some organisms are able to survive such extreme conditions. It is believed that these organisms may have evolved specific mechanisms to enable them to survive in such environments. Scientists believe that the leech’s ability to survive in liquid nitrogen may be related to its parasitic nature, as it lives in the bloodstream of turtles and other animals. The leeches have adapted certain physiological mechanisms to keep them alive in these hostile environments. The finding of the surviving leech was made by scientists at the National Institute of Polar Research in Japan. The team was studying the frozen remains of a sea turtle that had died in Antarctica, and discovered the leech inside the turtle’s body. The discovery of the surviving leech is significant as it will help scientists to better understand how living organisms can survive extreme cold, and may lead to new advances in cryogenics research. The study of cryogenics has already yielded many benefits in areas like food preservation and medicine. By freezing and storing human tissue and organs, scientists have been able to extend the time between donation and transplantation, making the process more efficient. In the field of food preservation, cryogenic techniques like flash freezing are used to preserve the nutritional quality of foods while extending their shelf life. Furthermore, in the production of electronics and other materials, cryogenic temperatures help to refine and purify the materials, leading to greater efficiency and performance. Despite these advances in the application of cryogenics, the process of freezing living organisms has remained a complex and difficult task, with many organisms dying as a result of the freezing process. The discovery of the surviving leech is therefore seen as a major breakthrough, and is expected to lead to new advances in the field of cryogenics in the future. In conclusion, the discovery of a parasitic leech that can survive immersion in liquid nitrogen is a significant development for the field of cryogenics. This breakthrough will help scientists to better understand how living organisms can survive in extreme cold conditions, and may lead to new advances in the study of cryogenics. The application of cryogenic techniques in areas like medicine, food preservation, and materials production has already yielded many benefits, and the discovery of the surviving leech is expected to contribute to further advancements in these areas.
