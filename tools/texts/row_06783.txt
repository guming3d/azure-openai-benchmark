article: A motorist in California claims that a gas pump continued to take his money after it stop dispensing fuel, with video evidence to prove it. Luis Maya said he was at a Costco store on Pelandale Avenue in Modesto on February 4 when the incident happened and quickly whipped his phone out to record the 'scam'. Footage shows a price sign on the pump continuing to creep up at the rate of around one cent every three seconds despite the nozzle being outside of the vehicle not dispensing gas. Maya apparently told Costco staff  about what had happened and showed them his film. They reported that they'd been having similar problems with another pump. Maya said he was outraged over the extra charges. 'I feel this is stealing, even though it's some change coming out of my account, but it adds up when you have hundreds of people that may not check throughout the day.' He uploaded his video to YouTube to serve as a warning to other drivers. Unfair charges: A motorist in California claims that a gas pump continued to take his money after it stop dispensing fuel, with video evidence to prove it . Caught on camera: Luis Maya said he was at a Costco store on Pelandale Avenue in Modesto on February 4 when the incident happened and quickly whipped his phone out to record the 'scam' 'When you're done pumping, check to see if it's still taking your money when it shouldn't, no matter what gas station,' Maya advised. According to the gas nozzle manufacturer Husky, there are many causes behind the phenomenon known as 'meter creep'. It can indicate that parts on the pump need replacing or there is a problem inside the dispenser. Fuel dispensers are subject to stringent requirements regarding safety, accuracy and security. The exact details differ between countries. Almost all California counties by law inspect gasoline pumps at least once per year. However, in Arizona checks are completed every four years unless there is a complaint. Maya says he will be more vigilant for 'meter creep' from now on. 'This isn't OK,' he concluded.

chatgpt: Modesto, California-- Luis Maya recently had a concerning experience while fueling up his car. Maya was at a Costco store on Pelandale Avenue in Modesto on February 4 when he noticed something strange happening at the gas pump. He quickly whipped out his phone to document what he believed was a scam. The phenomenon Maya recorded is known as "meter creep". It can occur when parts of the pump need replacing or when there is a problem inside the dispenser. In the video, the numbers on the fuel dispenser continued to increase even though Maya had stopped pumping gas into his car. Maya expressed his concern over the incident, stating, "I'm pretty sure that it is bad for our environment, it's bad for our community, and it's bad for ourselves too." Meter creep is not a new issue and has been reported across the country in the past. It has raised concerns as customers could be paying for fuel they didn't receive, affecting both their wallet and the environment. The California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) regulates fuel dispensers for accuracy and compliance with applicable state and federal laws. The CDFA has a system in place to test fuel dispensers for accuracy and has strict guidelines to ensure customers are not being overcharged for fuel. A spokesperson for Costco stated that they take all reports of meter creep seriously and have procedures in place to report and address any issues with their fuel dispensers. Maya's video has since gone viral on social media, with many people sharing their own experiences of meter creep at gas stations. Experts recommend that consumers keep an eye on the fuel dispenser while pumping gas and report any discrepancies in the readings to the gas station attendant immediately. As fuel prices continue to rise nationwide, incidents like meter creep can have a significant impact on consumers' wallets. Authorities and fuel retailers need to take proactive steps in ensuring the accuracy of their pumps and the protection of customers' wallets.
