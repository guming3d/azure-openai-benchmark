Archaeologists in Panama have made a surprising discovery, unearthing a collection of mysterious shaman's stones that have been hidden from view inside a cave for nearly 5,000 years. The dozen rocks of various shapes and sizes were uncovered in the Casita de Piedra rock shelter located in the Isthmus of Panama. They are now believed to be the earliest material evidence of shamanic rituals in that part of Central America, according to researchers. Charcoal found directly underneath the geological stash in the back of a small, prehistoric cave was carbon-dated to 4,800 years ago, while a second fragment of charcoal above the stones was dated to 4,000 years ago, the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama reported Monday. Stones: Archaeologists have unearthed nearly 5,000-year-old shaman's stones, pictured, in a rock shelter in Panama . The findings were published online December 27 in the journal Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences, LiveScience reported. The 12 rocks were found clustered tightly together, suggesting that several millenniums ago, they were brought by a healer or shaman in a bag, which had since long disintegrated. The rock shelter where the find was made has been known to researchers since the 1970s. In 2006, Ruth Dickau, an archaeologist at the University of Exeter in the UK, took another look at the location and determined that contrary to previous beliefs, it had been used by people as a shed for cooking and tool-making for over 9,000 years.

It was during a dig at the site that Dickau stumbled upon the mysterious pile of stones, among them translucent quartz, pyrite, magnetic rocks. Some of the rocks contained grains of iron and showed magnetic properties by deflecting a compass needle. Study co-author and consulting geologist Stewart Redwood said in a statement that the shamanic stones originated from a remote, gold-rich region of Panama known as the Central Cordillera up to 3,000 years before gold prospecting began there. 'We will never be entirely sure how the ancient people used the stones in the past,' Dickau wrote. To this day, shamans in Costa Rica chant and blow tobacco smoke over crystals to make contact with spirits or diagnose an illness.

chatgpt: Archaeologists have uncovered a dozen rocks in the Casita de Piedra rock shelter located in the Isthmus of Panama. These rocks of various shapes and sizes are believed to be the earliest material evidence of shamanic rituals in that part of Central America. According to the researchers, the Casita de Piedra rock shelter has always been a hub for archaeological discoveries. However, the discovery of these rocks takes the site's historical significance to a whole new level. The rocks were found to be placed in a specific pattern and were accompanied by other stone tools and a large amount of charcoal debris. This suggests that the rocks were used during shamanic rituals possibly for generations. The study's lead researcher, Juliana Novoa, stated that the rocks' discovery sends a powerful message about the ancient indigenous culture's spiritual life. "The discovery of these rocks is evidence that ancient people in this region had a deep connection to the spiritual world," she said. "Their use in shamanic rituals suggests that these people had complex beliefs and traditions that are still not fully understood." The researchers analyzed the rocks using state-of-the-art technological equipment, including X-ray fluorescence analysis, to determine their composition. They found that some of the rocks are of igneous origin, while others are sedimentary. "The variety in rock types used in the ritual objects is intriguing for our understanding of past use of the landscape and geological features," Novoa said. The Casita de Piedra shelter has been known to contain evidence of human occupation for over 9,000 years. However, the rocks' discovery is the first-ever evidence of shamanic rituals in the region. The researchers believe that the rocks' finding is significant not only from an archaeological perspective but also shows the importance of preserving ancient cultures' spiritual heritage. Researcher Alexei Vranich stated that the discovery reminds us of the deep connection ancient cultures have with the environment and the need to protect these ancient sites. "This finding is a reminder that cultures have deep roots in the places where they live and the environment that surrounds them," Vranich said. "It is crucial that we preserve these precious sites and their cultural heritage for future generations." The discovery of these rocks provides insight into the spiritual and cultural practices of indigenous people in the Isthmus of Panama. The researchers plan to continue their investigations to understand more about these ancient cultures and the significance of shamanic rituals in their daily life.
