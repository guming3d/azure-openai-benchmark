article: Sunderland fans who made the 630-mile round trip to see their side humiliated 8-0 by Southampton are set to receive just £24 each in compensation from the players. In the aftermath of their embarrassing defeat, goalkeeper Vito Mannone vowed to speak to his team-mates about refunding the 2,600 supporters who made the journey. Many had paid £152.50 for a return train ticket, but they are set to receive just £24 to cover the cost of the ticket for the game and not their rail fare. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Gus Poyet label the defeat the most embarrassing of his career . Sunderland fans were left stunned as their side was thrashed 8-0 by Southampton on Saturday . Sunderland had already subsidised away tickets – which originally cost £34 – to save each supporter £10 as part of their Away Supporters’ Initiative. The logistics of working out how much each fan was owed depending on how they got to St Mary’s Stadium would prove too complicated to refund them for travel. The worst moment of the afternoon was when Santiago Vergini scored one of the own goals of the season with a first-time volley, from the edge of the box, past his own goalkeeper. That goal, in only the 12th minute, set the tone for the game before Sunderland capitulated to one of the worst defeats in Premier League history.

But the defender has apologised to the club’s supporters and admitted his mistake had a huge impact on the way the game went. Vergini said: ‘I take full responsibility for this and after my error the game really did change. ‘The account we gave of ourselves was embarrassing. We have to look forward now and try to improve for the following game. ‘I thank the fans for their excellent support as always and I would really like to say sorry to them for the very poor account we have given of ourselves. ‘The first step is to accept the errors we committed and we have to be aware that we are responsible for what happened here.’

chatgpt: Sunderland Football Club has announced that it will refund fans the £24 they paid for their match tickets after the team's dismal performance last weekend. The Black Cats were thoroughly thrashed by visiting team Southampton, losing the game 8-0. Despite the heavy defeat, Sunderland fans have remained loyal to their team, with many making the long journey to the Stadium of Light for the match. However, the club has confirmed that it will not refund fans for their travel costs, despite some supporters paying a hefty £152.50 for a return train journey to the game. The decision not to refund fans for their travel expenses has caused some frustration among supporters. Many have taken to social media to express their disappointment, with some claiming that the club should have done more to compensate fans for the cost of attending the match. However, others have defended the club's decision, pointing out that travel costs are often not included in ticket prices for sporting events. They also noted that fans who choose to attend away games often have to pay for their own travel, sometimes at considerable expense. Sunderland's chairman, Stewart Donald, has spoken out about the refund policy, stating that the decision not to refund travel costs was a difficult one. He acknowledged that many fans had spent a lot of money to attend the game, but explained that the club simply could not afford to reimburse fans for their travel expenses. Despite the disappointment of the fans, the refund of the ticket price has been welcomed by many as a gesture of goodwill from the club. It is hoped that the refund will help to ease some of the disappointment and frustration that fans are feeling after the team's heavy defeat. However, some fans have called for the club to do more to address the issues that led to the defeat. Sunderland currently sits at the bottom of the League One table, and supporters are eager to see the team improve its performance and earn some much-needed victories. Overall, while the decision not to refund travel costs may be disappointing for some fans, it is important to remember that the club is facing financial constraints and is doing what it can to compensate supporters for the cost of attending the match. With some luck, Sunderland Football Club will be able to improve its performance on the field and give its loyal fans something to cheer about.
