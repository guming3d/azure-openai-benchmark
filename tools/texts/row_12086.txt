article: As if Hollywood hasn't had enough leaks of late. For a short time on Friday night, the official website of Sunday's Golden Globe Awards posted what appeared to be this year's winners in two top Globes categories, setting off some momentary excitement in the industry trade press. Selma and Into The Woods were named as the two top winners for the 72nd annual Golden Globes, which are set for Sunday night. Scroll Down for Video . Whoops?! This grab of the Golden Globes website from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association shows the captions reveal Selma and Into the Woods are winners, while keeping pictures of last year's winners, 12 Years a Slave and American Hustle . The Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which runs the annual awards, referred all inquiries to its site administrator, Bluefin. 'While testing the official website of the Golden Globe Awards for Sunday's ceremony, Bluefin inadvertently took the test live,' said a company statement. 'We randomly selected two film titles with no knowledge of the category winners. We are solely responsible for the error.' The apparent inadvertent reveal named Selma, the historical drama about Martin Luther King and the civil rights movement, as the winner of the outstanding motion picture in the drama category. Front runner: Selma, which documents the work of Martin Luther King and the civil rights movement is a favorite for Oscar's glory . Stars: Meryl Streep is one of the stars of Into the Woods, which also features new Late Late Show host James Corden . Fantasy drama, Into the Woods, which stars upcoming Late Late Show host James Corden, was named as the best motion picture, musical or comedy. The apparent mistake was revealed when visitors to the Golden Globes website saw images of last year's winners, 12 Years a Slave and American Hustle with captions for Into the Woods and Selma. However, not too much should be read into the error. In 2009, Anne Hathaway was named on the HFPA website as the winner in the actress category for Rachel Getting Married, but ultimately, Kate Winslet won and not Hathaway.

chatgpt: Awards season is always a tense time for those in the movie industry, with studios and stars alike eagerly waiting to see if their latest efforts will be recognized by the various organizations that hand out statues and plaques. This year, though, there was a bit of confusion over the winners of two categories, thanks to a website error that briefly had everyone scratching their heads. According to the website in question, which lists the nominees and eventual winners of a number of prestigious awards, it appeared that Selma and Into the Woods had both won in their respective categories. However, this was quickly corrected shortly afterward, causing some confusion among those keen-eyed observers who caught the mistake before the site was updated. In the case of Selma, the website initially listed the film as the winner of the Best Picture category, in addition to David Oyelowo winning Best Actor and Ava DuVernay taking Best Director. Meanwhile, Into the Woods was listed as the winner of the Best Original Score category. However, it was soon revealed that these listings were not accurate, and that the actual winners were different films and individuals. As it turned out, the winner of Best Picture was Birdman, while Eddie Redmayne was named Best Actor for his work in The Theory of Everything. Meanwhile, the Best Director award went to Richard Linklater for Boyhood, not DuVernay, and the Best Original Score was awarded to The Grand Budapest Hotel. Despite the fact that the confusion was quickly resolved, the incident caused a bit of a stir among those who follow the awards season closely. Some were quick to point out that even small errors like these can have an impact on the way that movies are perceived by audiences and critics alike, and that the individuals responsible for maintaining the website should take their duties more seriously. Others, though, were quick to point out that mistakes happen, and that it's important to remember that awards are just one small part of the larger film ecosystem. While it's certainly true that recognition from prestigious organizations can help boost a film's profile and bring it to a wider audience, it's important not to lose sight of the fact that every movie, regardless of whether or not it wins any awards, has the power to touch and change people's lives in profound ways. In the end, the awards website error was a minor blip in what has been an otherwise exciting and rewarding awards season for many in the movie industry. While it's always nice to be recognized for one's work, it's important to remember that the most important thing is to keep making great films, and to keep telling stories that matter.
