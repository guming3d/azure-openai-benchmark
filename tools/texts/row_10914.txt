article: Model Paulina Gretzky isn't a pro golfer but she's made it onto the cover of the latest issue of Golf Digest. The controversial move has left some women in the sport frustrated as the magazine defends its position. Golf Digest, which bills itself as "the authority on how to play, what to play and where to play," has explained that as the fianc√©e of PGA Tour pro Dustin Johnson, Gretzky is a major celebrity in the golf world and thereby qualifies the recognition of a cover story. "Sports figures, celebrities and models have appeared on Golf Digest covers since the magazine's beginning," the publication's editor in chief, Jerry Tarde, says in a statement. "Paulina ranks at the high end of the golf celebrity scene today, and she has a compelling story to tell. She also might get some new people interested in the game." But to some members of the Ladies Professional Golf Association, choosing Gretzky -- who, yes, is the daughter of hockey great Wayne Gretzky -- means a female pro golfer is getting overlooked. "It's the state of where we've always been. We don't get the respect for being the golfers we are," Stacy Lewis, a top-ranked American golfer, has told press, according to USA Today. "Obviously, Golf Digest is trying to sell magazines, but at the same time you like to see a little respect for the women's game." In the Golf Digest piece, Gretzky discusses her involvement in the sport and demonstrates six golf-improvement exercises. On the cover and in two of the photos used to promote the issue, which is available via tablet starting April 8 and from newsstands starting April 15, she doesn't wear the typical golf attire but rather fitted workout pants and a sports bra. Golf Digest appears to have anticipated the reaction to the cover, as it already has an answer to the question, "What's Paulina Gretzky doing on the cover of Golf Digest?" up on its website. The response falls in line with what editor Tarde says in his statement: given the fact that Gretzky is "as much a subject of fascination at tournaments as the guy she's there watching," combined with the fact that "she's an attractive, fit woman who -- like many of our prospective readers -- is fairly new to golf ... she seemed a natural cover subject for our second annual issue devoted to fitness." That position seems to answer the query veteran golfer Angela Stanford has asked: Who, exactly, is Golf Digest trying to sell to? "If the answer is men 25 years old through 45 years old, then I guess that's what they have to do," she told USA Today. "You know the old saying, sex sells. And nobody can argue with that. It's just the way it is. But the LPGA has some attractive women and very fit women, so why not use them? I'm just baffled by it."

chatgpt: The latest issue of Golf Digest featuring Paulina Gretzky, who is engaged to professional golfer Dustin Johnson, has sparked controversy among women in the sport. Critics argue that Gretzky's appearance on the cover of the magazine is indicative of the lack of recognition for professional female golfers. Despite not being a professional golfer herself, Gretzky's inclusion on the cover has caused a stir on social media. Many female golfers have expressed frustration over the lack of recognition and opportunities afforded to female athletes, particularly in comparison to their male counterparts. Professional golfer and Solheim Cup team member Mel Reid spoke out on Twitter, stating that the cover was "disappointing" and highlighted the need for more support and recognition for women in the sport. In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the gender pay gap in professional sports and the need for greater representation and diversity. Many female golfers have noted that Gretzky's appearance on the cover perpetuates stereotypes of women in the sport as primarily decorative rather than competitive athletes. Some have also pointed out that it is particularly frustrating given the strong female talent currently in the sport, such as South Korean golfer Jin Young Ko and American LPGA player Nelly Korda. Golf Digest has defended its decision to feature Gretzky on the cover, citing her influence and popularity among golf fans. The magazine has also noted that it regularly features women in the sport, including female professionals, and is dedicated to promoting diversity and representation. Despite this response, the controversy surrounding the issue highlights the ongoing challenges for women in sports, particularly those in male-dominated industries such as golf. According to a report by Forbes, women's sports receive only 4% of sports media coverage in the US, highlighting the need for greater visibility and recognition. Many female golfers have emphasized the need for change in the industry and the importance of supporting and promoting female talent in the sport. In response to the controversy, some women golfers have launched creative campaigns on social media to showcase their skills and raise awareness of the gender gap in golf. Despite the ongoing challenges, there have been some positive developments in the sport regarding gender representation. In 2019, the Augusta National Golf Club announced that it would host the Augusta National Women's Amateur, marking a significant step forward for female golfers and expanding opportunities for women in the sport. As the conversation around gender and diversity in sports continues, it's clear that there is still much work to be done to support and promote female athletes in the industry. However, the controversy surrounding Golf Digest's latest issue featuring Paulina Gretzky has sparked important questions and conversations that could lead to positive change in the future.
