article: (CNN) -- The new Steven Spielberg blockbuster "Lincoln" focuses on the final months of the U.S. president's life as he tries to find a way to end the Civil War and unite the country. Now, the document Lincoln signed that officially started the war is up for sale, valued at nearly a million dollars. The one-page document, signed April 19, 1861, authorized the blockade of Southern ports, which, under international law, was an act of war. "The action was bold and with great risk," said Nathan Raab, vice president of The Raab Collection, which is offering the document for sale at $900,000. "Lincoln was aware that the blockading of ports was an act of war. Some in his cabinet argued that a blockade would constitute recognition of the sovereignty of the Confederacy, something the North wanted to avoid. Lincoln was less interested in the legal definitions of 'war' than in victory, and he approved it despite the objections." Go where Lincoln went . The Supreme Court later ruled the document as the official start of the Civil War, Raab said. It was April 12, 1861, when Confederate forces opened fire on Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor, South Carolina, initiating the hostilities between North and South. Three days later, Lincoln issued a proclamation that an insurrection existed, and he called out 75,000 men to put it down. Four days after that, on April 19, he ordered the Southern port blockade. "I hereby authorize and direct the Secretary of State to affix the Seal of the United States to a Proclamation setting on foot a Blockade of the ports of the States of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas," the document states. Lincoln's signature is at the bottom, "firm and bold, exactly as you'd like to see," Raab said. Lincoln's lessons for Obama . The privately owned document has been on exhibit for several years at public institutions across the country, including the National Constitution Center and the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Museum and Library. "It's been passed down to posterity quite well," Raab said. "It's survived the 150 years in good shape." The Spielberg movie and the 150th anniversary of the Civil War have generated a lot of interest in the document and in Lincoln items in general, Raab said. Spielberg film brilliant, reviewer says .

chatgpt: A document that authorized the blockade of Southern ports was ruled by the Supreme Court to be the official start of the Civil War. This privately owned document has been on public display for several years, but now it will be sold to the first bidder who offers the asking price of $900,000. The document, known as Executive Order No. 1, was signed by President Abraham Lincoln on April 15, 1861, just three days after the Confederacy attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina. The order authorized the blockade of Southern ports, which was a key action in the Union's effort to cut off the Confederacy's access to supplies and goods. For years, this document has been on public display at the National Archives Museum in Washington, D.C. It has been a centerpiece of exhibits about the Civil War and has drawn thousands of visitors. But now, for the first time in years, the document is up for sale to the highest bidder. The decision to sell this historic document has sparked controversy, with some historians arguing that it should remain in public ownership. However, the current owner of the document, who wishes to remain anonymous, has stated that the time has come to sell it. "We have taken great care to preserve this document and share it with the public," the owner said. "But it is time for someone else to own this important piece of history." The starting bid for the document is $900,000, which some experts say is a fair price considering its significance. However, others argue that it is difficult to place a monetary value on an item with such historical significance. "This document is a symbol of a pivotal moment in American history," said historian David Blight. "Its sale raises important questions about the role of private ownership in preserving our national heritage." The sale of the document is expected to draw intense interest from collectors and institutions around the world. Many hope that it will ultimately end up in a public institution where it can continue to be shared with future generations. Regardless of its ultimate destination, the sale of this document is a reminder of the profound impact the Civil War had on our country's history. The authorization of the blockade of Southern ports was just the beginning of a conflict that would claim hundreds of thousands of lives and forever alter the course of our nation.
