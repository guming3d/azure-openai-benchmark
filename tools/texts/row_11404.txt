article: (EW.com) -- Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton), a high school physics teacher, has a house the bank is about to foreclose on and a daughter with an (expensive) heart defect. He's also a former mixed-martial-arts champion, and so -- strictly for the money -- he decides to get back in the ring, even if the clawing, kicking, anything-goes bouts threaten to kill him. Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy), an Iraq-war veteran who left the battlefield under mysterious circumstances, is also an MMA fighter, and he too wants back in the ring. The two men are brothers, and were once close. But the only thing that unites them now, apart from their ruthless hand-to-hand prowess, is how much they hate their father, Paddy (Nick Nolte), a recovering alcoholic whose drinking tore the family apart. 'Rescue Me' series finale: Were you satisfied? "Warrior," a two-track drama of fighting and redemption, tells the parallel stories of Brendan and Tommy, and the movie, with its grim, deliberate rhythms and grainy '70s-style look, comes on as if it were no mere sports fable. It's about demon-haunted Irish Catholic men testing and punishing themselves. It's about broken families coming together. It's about economic desperation and about America getting off the ropes and recovering its fighting spirit. If "Rocky" was sweet and inspiring, and "The Fighter" was touching and fascinating, "Warrior" is at times almost gravely self-important. The gifted director Gavin O'Connor ("Miracle") brings the film an affecting, ripped-from-the-guts spirit, even if he can't really hide how many old-movie tropes are floating around in it. PTC slams 'Toddlers & Tiaras' for 'Pretty Woman' hooker costume . Mostly, "Warrior" is a showcase for its up-and-coming stars. Edgerton, from last year's "Animal Kingdom," and Hardy, who stole scenes as the identity forger in "Inception," both have a tense, tough presence, though in a slightly colorless way. You buy them as brothers, and as gnarly brawlers hungry to win, but Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale they are not. In this film, they're closer to the second coming of Tom Berenger and Michael ParÃ©.

chatgpt: "Warrior": A Fighting and Redemption Tale with a Gritty '70s Style The movie "Warrior" tells the parallel stories of two estranged brothers, Brendan (played by Joel Edgerton) and Tommy (played by Tom Hardy), as they both participate in a mixed martial arts tournament called Sparta. As they fight for the $5 million prize, each brother has his own motivations and demons to overcome.  The movie has a unique, grainy '70s-style look that sets it apart from other modern sports dramas. The cinematography highlights the sweat and grit of the fighters, giving the fights a realistic and raw feel. Director Gavin O'Connor creates a world filled with characters who are deeply flawed and fighting for survival. At times, however, the movie can feel almost gravely self-important. The movie's heavy-handed message of redemption and forgiveness can come across as preachy, and some of the dialogue can be clunky and overly dramatic.  Joel Edgerton delivers a nuanced and authentic performance as Brendan, a former MMA fighter turned high school physics teacher who returns to the ring to support his family. His character is sympathetic and relatable, and his chemistry with his loving wife (played by Jennifer Morrison) adds a touch of warmth to the movie.  Tom Hardy gives a powerful and intense performance as Tommy, a former marine haunted by his past who enters the tournament for his own reasons. His character is stoic and unemotional, but Hardy's physicality and acting ability make him an unforgettable presence on screen.  Nick Nolte delivers a standout performance as the brothers' estranged father, a recovering alcoholic and former boxing coach who hopes to reconcile with his sons. He brings a level of emotional depth and vulnerability to the movie, and his scenes with Hardy are particularly poignant.  Despite its flaws, "Warrior" is a thrilling and emotional ride. The movie's two-track drama of fighting and redemption offers a refreshing take on the sports genre, and the performances of the lead actors make it a must-see for any fan of MMA or drama.
