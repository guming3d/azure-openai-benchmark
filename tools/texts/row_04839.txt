The White House on Saturday said that Israel had the right to defend itself against attack and decide how to respond to rocket fire from the Gaza Strip.

Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are in agreement that a de-escalation of the violence is preferred, provided that Hamas stops sending rocket into Israel, Rhodes said. The Israeli government has called up thousands of reservists and massed troops, tanks and other armored vehicles along the border with Gaza, signalling a ground invasion could be imminent. Israel launched the offensive on Wednesday by assassinating Hamas' military commander, but Rhodes said the U.S. believes 'the precipitating factor for the conflict was the rocket fire coming out of Gaza.’ He added, 'These rockets have been fired into Israeli civilian areas and territory for some time now. So Israelis have endured far too much of a threat from these rockets for far too long, and that is what led the Israelis to take the action that they did in Gaza.'

chatgpt: In the latest news from the Middle East, the White House has clarified that Israel is solely responsible for its defense tactics and assault decisions. This announcement came after Gaza was hit with nearly 200 airstrikes on Saturday, which left the prime minister's headquarters completely destroyed. The ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine has escalated in the past week, with 42 Palestinians and three Israelis losing their lives in the fighting. The Israeli military has been targeting the Hamas militant group's infrastructure and rocket-launching sites, while Hamas, in turn, has been firing rockets into Israel. The decision to launch these airstrikes was met with international condemnation, with many calling for a ceasefire. The United Nations also expressed its concern for the safety of innocent civilians caught in the crossfire. Several countries have urged Israel and Palestine to work towards a peaceful resolution of the conflict. However, the White House's statement makes it clear that Israel is a sovereign state with the right to defend itself against any threats. The United States stands with Israel in its efforts to protect its citizens and maintain its security against any hostile elements. The ongoing conflict has now entered its second week, and there is no clear end in sight. Efforts to broker a ceasefire have been fruitless so far, and both sides are yet to show any willingness to back down. In the meantime, the people of Gaza continue to suffer from the violence. Thousands have been forced to flee their homes, seeking shelter in schools and other public buildings. There have also been reports of shortages of food and medical supplies, as the infrastructure in the region has been severely damaged. Human rights groups have expressed concern for the safety of Palestinian civilians caught in the crossfire. They have called for an immediate end to the violence and for all parties to respect international law and human rights. The conflict between Israel and Palestine is one of the oldest and most complex issues in contemporary world history. The current violence has once again highlighted the urgency of the need for a lasting peace agreement between the two sides. Until then, innocent civilians will continue to suffer, and the entire region will remain unstable. In conclusion, the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine has escalated in the past week, with the Israeli military launching nearly 200 airstrikes on Gaza. The White House has clarified that Israel is solely responsible for its defense tactics and assault decisions. Efforts to broker a ceasefire have been unsuccessful so far, and the situation on the ground remains tense. The international community has called for an immediate end to the fighting and for both sides to work towards a peaceful resolution of the conflict.
