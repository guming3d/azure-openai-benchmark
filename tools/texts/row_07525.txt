A skydiver found dead after a collision with another parachutist in eastern San Diego County has been identified as the 27-year-old brother-in-law of NASCAR driver Jimmie Johnson. Jordan Janway died Sunday while skydiving with two others at Jamul, the county medical examiner's office says in a statement Monday. Janway collided with one of the other jumpers during freefall, failed to open his parachute and fell to the ground. A statement posted on Johnson's website says Janway was the brother of Johnson's wife, Chandra. The statement asks for prayers and privacy. Skydive San Diego owner Buzz Fink told reporters the victim was a veteran of more than 1,000 jumps. The medical examiner has yet to schedule an examination of the body. Deputies were called to search for the man around 4.30pm at John Nichol's Field, NBC San Diego reports. Janway was found at 5:15pm. Company Skydive San Diego operates out of that field, the channel reports. Fink said the victim was an experienced instructor with the company who had taken a group up for skydiving instruction.

Janway apparently collided with the other jumper's leg mid-air and was injured too badly to open his parachute. The other jumper was not injured and safely landed in the drop zone, NBC San Diego reports. Fink said Janway and other instructors usually used a device that would automatically open his parachute in an emergency -- but it was sent out for maintenance last week, UT-San Diego reports. 'We do well over 100,000 jumps a year, and we pride ourselves on our safety and everything we do as far as our equipment, our airplanes,' Fink told the channel.

'However, it is skydiving and things can happen and generally you do everything we can to prevent it.' 'I liken it to driving down the road. You have a safety belt, an air bag. The bottom line is, you're still at a risk if someone crosses that line and hits your car,' he said. The last death at the center occurred about five years ago when a man was tangled in his chute and hit his head on a rock when he landed, UT-San Diego reports.

chatgpt: Jordan Janway died on Sunday while skydiving in Jamul, located in eastern San Diego County, according to a statement made by the county medical examiner's office on Monday. Janway's tragic death has shocked the skydiving community and made national headlines. Janway, who was a veteran of over 1,000 jumps, was skydiving with two others when the accident occurred. The instructor, who collided with another jumper's leg mid-air, was too badly injured to open his parachute, while the other jumper managed to land safely in the drop zone. The victim was identified as the brother of Chandra Johnson, the wife of retired NFL star, Keyshawn Johnson. A statement posted on Johnson's website expressed his condolences and asked for prayers for his family during this difficult time. The incident happened at Skydive San Diego, which is known to be one of the best skydiving destinations in the country. The facility's owner, Buzz Fink, expressed his sadness at the loss of such an experienced skydiver. Fink added that his team is cooperating fully with the investigation, and they are committed to making sure that every precaution is taken to prevent such accidents from happening in the future. Skydiving, like any other adventure sport, carries its own set of risks. Despite rigorous safety protocols and equipment, sometimes things can go wrong, and lives can be lost. Such incidents serve as reminders that even the most experienced skydivers are not immune to accidents. According to a 2019 report by the United States Parachute Association, there were 15 fatal skydiving accidents out of approximately 3.3 million jumps that year, which translates to a 0.00455% fatality rate. While this is a relatively small number, it still represents a significant risk that skydivers take every time they jump out of a plane. Janway's death is undoubtedly a tragedy for his family, friends, and the wider skydiving community. Still, it also highlights the importance of maintaining high safety standards and the need to constantly be vigilant in preventing accidents of any kind. As the investigation continues, our thoughts go out to all those affected by this terrible loss.
