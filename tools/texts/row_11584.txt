article: By . Michael Zennie for MailOnline . When is a $100 bill not worth $100? When it's in Mississippi, where it's worth $116. Or in Hawaii, where the value shrinks to just $85. A new map by the non-partisan Tax Foundation reveals that the cost of living difference between states means the value of the cash in your pocket varies wildly. The Tax Foundation used federal data on regional price variations to calculate just how far a Ben Franklin goes in all 50 states. And the differences are striking. A dollar is worth 30percent more in Mississippi than it is in Washington, D.C - which has the highest prices in the country. The Tax Foundation used new federal data to show that $100 goes a lot farther in some states than others - and it varies by up to 30percent, based on prices differences between regions . The Tax Foundation showed how residents of Kansas are actually richer than New York residents after factoring in the price of goods . The states $100 goes the farthest are: Mississippi ($115.74), Arkansas ($114.16), Missouri ($113.51), Alabama (113.51), and South Dakota ($113.38). The states where $100 is worth the least are: District of Columbia ($84.60), Hawaii ($85.32), New York ($86.66), New Jersey ($87.64), and California ($88.57). In some states, $100 is still just $100. In Illinois a C-note is worth $99.40. In Florida and Oregon, it's worth $101.21. Tax Foundation says the regional cost differences, which were recently released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis for the first time ever, could help Americans rethink the places that they live. For instance, Oklahoma has a significantly lower average income compared to New York ($37,000 vs $45,000). Adjusted for cost of living differences, however, Oklahoma jumps several places in the rankings and New York falls several places - making the real average income in Oklahoma $41,000 and just $39,000 in New York. All this means that $50,000 after taxes in a high cost of living state like New York is really worth just $43,000. That same $50,00 in Oklahoma actually feels more like $56,000. The public policy implications are also immense; $100 in food assistance to a poor family in Washington, D.C., would buy less than $85 worth of food, while it will buy nearly $116 in Mississippi. The Bureau of Economic Analysis introduced the federal government's first-ever statistics on regional price differences in April. The data to calculate the cost of living variation across the country is culled from Consumer Price Index information. The CPI continually measures the cost of a 'basket of goods' in cities across the nation to keep track of inflation. The data, however, also provides insight into price differences in communities across the country. The CPI testers keep track of prices of things like: .

chatgpt: A new map by the Tax Foundation has revealed that the value of $100 can vary significantly between different states in the US. The map compares the price differences between states, which can vary by as much as 30%. According to the map, Washington, D.C., Hawaii, New York and New Jersey are the places where $100 is worth the least. On the other hand, a C-note goes farthest in Mississippi, Arkansas, Missouri, and Alabama. The map shows that $100 in Washington, D.C., will only buy you goods and services that would cost $84.96 in a state like Mississippi. This means that the purchasing power of $100 is much lower in Washington, D.C. compared to Mississippi. Similarly, the value of $100 is only $86.51 in Hawaii, $87.34 in New York, and $88.18 in New Jersey. These states are some of the most expensive places to live in the US, and the cost of living is significantly higher than in other states. In contrast, the value of $100 is much higher in states like Mississippi, where it is worth $115.74, Arkansas where it is worth $114.16, Missouri where it is worth $113.51, and Alabama where it is worth $113.51. These states have a lower cost of living compared to the likes of Hawaii and New York, which means that the purchasing power of $100 is much higher in these states. The value of $100 also varies within states. For example, the value of $100 is higher in rural areas of states like New York and California compared to urban areas like New York City and San Francisco. Similarly, the value of $100 is higher in the suburbs of some states compared to their cities. The map also shows that states with high taxes tend to have a lower value for $100 compared to states with lower taxes. This is because taxes increase the cost of living and reduce the purchasing power of citizens. States like California, New York, and Illinois, which have some of the highest state taxes in the US, also have some of the lowest values for $100. The value of $100 is a significant indicator of living standards in different states. The tax foundation’s map is an essential tool for anyone looking to compare the living standards of different states based on the value of $100. The map can also be used by policymakers to make decisions about tax policies and cost-of-living adjustments. In conclusion, the tax foundation’s map shows that the value of $100 can vary significantly between states. The purchasing power of $100 is at its lowest in states like Washington, D.C., Hawaii, New York and New Jersey, and highest in states like Mississippi, Arkansas, Missouri, and Alabama. The map highlights the impact of taxes and the cost of living on the value of $100 and can be used to make informed decisions about tax policies and cost-of-living adjustments.
