article: Ryse has divided opinion. In one corner, gamers were astounded by its undeniable beauty. In the other, the short, button-mashing playable demo at this year's E3 left many thinking Ryse was a case of all style but no substance. You play Marius Titus, a young Roman soldier whose family is murdered by barbarian bandits. Fuelled by revenge, Titus enlists in the Roman army, travelling to Britannia and rising through the ranks to become leader of one of the deadliest military forces in history. Photorealistic? Thanks to CryEngine 3, the powerhouse that fuelled Crysis 3, facial detail across the board is truly next-gen . Powered by the CryEngine 3, gameplay revolves around third-person hacking and slashing. Hammering different buttons unleashes unique combos, while certain moves trigger Quick Time events for brutal finishing attacks. It's a tried and tested formula but the level of detail in the brutality is something current-gen consoles have never been able to capture. Using advanced Vertex animation, you'll see the anger in your foes eyes as they charge at you. Their determination as they swing a sword frantically at your head. And their fear when they stare at your sword hurtling towards their mid-section. What's perhaps even more impressive is that this attention to detail isn't lost on a larger scale. Every soldier on the screen is painstakingly animated - not just floating vaguely in the background. Add to the mix Crytek's Virtual Camera hardware that manipulates lighting, the environment and other effects in real-time, and you've got an incredibly life-like interpretation of battles in that period. Perhaps less realistic are Titus's movements during combat. There's a clever multi-directional attack function - allowing you to take on more than one enemy, but Titus 'glides' around like he's on an ice rink. Hit detection, too, needed some work. Rome, sweet Rome: Although the demo focused sly on action, gamers can expect an enthralling story . Ryse is also Kinect and SmartGlass compatible. Through Kinect, you can command your troops in real time via voice recognition technology, while SmartGlass lets you launch the game where you left off. As well as upgrading your character, the in-game DVR lets players review and share the best experiences from their game directly from their tablet, while context-sensitive achievements and guides help you unlock as many secrets as possible. Anyone who played the Last of Us demo will know just how far away that is from the full game. It was so much more than simply killing zombies. Xbox fans will hope the same applies to Ryse. Ryse is an Xbox One exclusive launch title. Let us know what you think on Twitter: @DailyMailGames and on Facebook: Daily Mail Games.
