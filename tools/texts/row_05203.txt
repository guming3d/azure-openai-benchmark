article: Washington (CNN) -- Former U.S. Rep. Gary Condit's semen was found on underwear belonging to Chandra Levy, according to an FBI biologist testifying Wednesday in the trial of Ingmar Guandique, who is accused of murdering the Washington intern in 2001. The panties were retrieved in May 2001 by investigators searching Levy's apartment in the days after her parents reported her missing. Her body was found over a year later in Washington's Rock Creek Park. The testimony addresses the question of whether Condit, a sitting congressman from California at the time Levy vanished, was having an affair with the intern, who had just turned 24 when she disappeared. The biologist, Alan Giusti, testified for prosecutors that no DNA was recovered from a separate pair of underwear and sports tights recovered from the crime scene. Regarding lab tests of the underwear recovered from Levy's apartment, Giusti said that "the sperm DNA profile was compared to and matched to Gary Condit." Condit, who testified in the trial on November 1, has refused to address the question of whether he had sex with Levy. "We've lost our feeling for common decency," Condit told prosecutor Amanda Haines when she asked in court if the two had been intimate. "I didn't commit any crime. I didn't do anything wrong." The disappearance of Levy, then an intern for the federal Bureau of Prisons, drew national attention after her parents discovered a connection with Condit. The congressman was never a suspect in the case, but was questioned intensively for details as to Levy's whereabouts. Prosecutors believe Guandique, a reputed member of the Salvadoran gang Mara Salvatrucha, attacked Levy while she was jogging and then killed her when she began to scream. Guandique denies that he attacked Levy. There has been no physical evidence linking him to the assault, leaving prosecutors to base their case largely on Guandique's alleged jailhouse admission that he killed the young intern. Partly as a result, prosecutors on Wednesday asked the trial judge to drop two of the six counts against Guandique, including a count of first degree sexual assault. He is still, however, facing first degree murder, kidnapping, and robbery charges. The judge rejected a defense motion to acquit Guandique on the remaining counts.

chatgpt: Prosecutors have recommended dropping two of the six charges against Ingmar Guandique, who is accused of murdering Chandra Levy while she was jogging. This development comes as the case against Guandique has taken a new twist - the FBI has revealed that former Rep. Gary Condit's semen was found on Levy's underwear. Condit has refused to confirm whether or not he was having an affair with Levy. The case against Guandique developed due to his connection to Levy's murder. Levy, who was a 24-year-old intern, disappeared on May 1, 2001, while she was out for a jog in Rock Creek Park in Washington D.C. Guandique was later convicted of the crime and sentenced to 60 years in prison. However, prosecutors have recommended dropping two of the six charges against Guandique, stating that they are no longer convinced of his guilt. This decision comes after the revelation that Conditâ€™s semen was found on Levy's underwear. While this is not proof of guilt, it raises even more questions in the long-running investigation. Condit, who was Levy's congressman at the time of her death, has always been linked to the case due to rumors of a romantic relationship between the two. However, he has consistently refused to confirm or deny if he was having an affair with Levy. The discovery of his DNA on her underwear brings this issue to the forefront once again. The case against Guandique has always been controversial, with many questioning the evidence used to convict him. The revelation of Condit's DNA adds another layer of complexity to this already complicated case. The dropped charges are a positive development for Guandique, but with this new information, the true killer may still be out there. Levy's death was a tragic event that shook the nation, and the investigation surrounding it has been ongoing for nearly two decades. With the latest revelation, the case may take yet another turn. The dropping of charges against Guandique will surely give his defense team a boost, but it remains to be seen what impact Condit's semen will have on the investigation as a whole.
