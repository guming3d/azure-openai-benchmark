article: A concert violinist diagnosed with a tremor was able to help surgeons locate the exact spot in his brain to place an implant by playing his instrument during the operation. Roger Frisch, a concert master with the Minnesota Orchestra, was diagnosed in 2009 with essential tremors, a condition that occurs when sections of the brain that control movement start sending abnormal signals. Frisch’s condition was so mild that in many other line of work he might have been able to ignore it, but as a concert violinist it threatened his career. Scroll down for video . Roger Frisch, a concert master with the Minnesota Orchestra, was diagnosed in 2009 with essential tremors, a condition that occurs when sections of the brain that control movement start sending abnormal signals . Frisch underwent the operation in the Spring and since then has returned to his position as Associate Concertmaster with the Minnesota Orchestra . It took doctors a couple of years to determine Frisch's diagnosis and then or him to agree to the still experimental Deep Brain Stimulation procedure surgery. The surgery involved a tiny electrode being implanted into his brain, which doctors assured Frisch would enable him to control the condition at the flick of a switch. In order for the electrode to work, it had to be implanted in exactly the right position, reports EverydayHealth. Because surgeons can operate on the brain without the patient feeling pain, it enables them to see in real time if and how the tremor is responding as they place the electrode. Frisch's tremor was so mild that in many other lines of work he might have been able to ignore it, but as a concert violinist it threatened his career . Frisch now carries a device which allows him to turn his tremor off and on with the push of a button that controls the stimulator . Frisch’s tremor was so mild, however, that his surgeon was worried he would not be able to tell whether the electrode had been properly placed. Doctors then came up with the ingenious idea of using Frisch's violin bow to help determine where his tremor was. An accelerometer was place on the end of Frisch’s bow which translated his tremor into a graph on a computer screen that surgeons could watch. So while surgeons fitted the electrodes, he played his violin. Frisch underwent the operation in the Spring and since then he has resumed his position as Associate Concertmaster with the Minnesota Orchestra. He now carries a small device which allows him to turn his tremor off and on with the push of a button that controls the stimulator. Three weeks after brain surgery he was able to play in a full-length sextet performance and a week after that he was performing again with the orchestra. He told String Visions that the tremor is now 'nonexistent.' Video: Violinists plays on during brain surgery .

chatgpt: Minnesota Orchestra Concert Master Plays Violin During Brain Surgery to Control Essential Tremors A concert master with the Minnesota Orchestra has made history by playing his violin during experimental brain surgery to control essential tremors, a movement disorder that can render tasks such as holding a pen or utensil difficult or even impossible.  Roger Frisch, a 60-year-old violinist, has been struggling with the condition for over a decade. When sections of the brain controlling movement start sending abnormal signals, the essential tremors occur. Frisch has tried various medications and therapies, but none of them provided satisfactory relief. Thus, Frisch agreed to undergo an experimental surgery that involves implanting tiny electrodes into his brain. The operation took place in the spring of 2009 under local anesthesia, with Frisch remaining alert to help guide the surgeons. To ensure that the electrodes were positioned correctly, Frisch played his violin during the surgery. The surgical team asked him to perform, and he played for one hour. Frisch felt only a mild headache during the procedure and was amazed at the outcome. Less than a month after the surgery, Frisch was performing again with the Minnesota Orchestra. He now has a device implanted in his chest that controls the electrodes in his brain, and he can turn it on and off at will. Frisch has his life back. He no longer struggles with shaking and can play his beautiful music with ease. According to the manufacturer, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has a success rate of up to 90% for patients with essential tremors. Frisch’s case is just one example of the technology’s potential benefits. The device works by sending electrical impulses through the electrodes, which then modify the abnormal brain activity causing the tremors. The surgery is not without risks, and not all patients are good candidates for this procedure. The technology is also expensive, and insurance coverage can be limited. Nevertheless, DBS is a promising treatment option that has improved the lives of countless patients. Frisch’s story is an inspiring reminder of the resilience of the human spirit and the power of innovative medical technology. His experience has also brought awareness to a condition that affects millions worldwide. Essential tremors can be a debilitating disorder, but with the right treatment and care, patients can regain control of their lives. The Minnesota Orchestra and Roger Frisch have made history with their courageous actions. Thanks to their efforts, essential tremors will no longer be a life sentence for affected individuals, and new hope is on the horizon.
