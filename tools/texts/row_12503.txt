She started undressing, preparing to wade into the water to save it, but was shocked to see that it could swim and stay afloat on its own. 'It kept its head above water and seemed to be moving its feet, almost as if it was kicking or paddling.,' Keller wrote in a piece for North America Birding. 'The owl was making a direct path to the opposite shoreline – quite honestly, swimming better than I could have.' Magnificent: The great horned owl - also called a tiger owl - is the most widely distributed true owl in the Americas . To see more work from photographer Steve Spitzer, visit his Flickr page here.

chatgpt: In an unusual and rare sighting, a grand horned owl was recently seen swimming in Lake Michigan in an attempt to escape two peregrine falcons. The amazing footage of the owl struggling to stay afloat was captured by a photographer and birder named Steve Spitzer. Spitzer was already used to being around several species of birds at Loyola Park Beach in Chicago, where he was photographing some migratory birds when he spotted something that caught his attention. It was a grand horned owl trying to get away from two peregrine falcons that were on its tail. In a survival instinct move, the owl took to water, a move that left Spitzer stunned. According to Spitzer, the owl was in the water for a few minutes before it began to stroke its wings to try and make its way to safety. The owl knew it could not stay in the water too long, as it could become hypothermic and weaken quickly. So, it used its wings like paddles to get across the waters. Spitzer, who has been photographing birds for over fifteen years, said that this was the first time he had ever seen such a scene. For him, it was a testament to the resilience of nature and how even the most unexpected animals can have extraordinary survival skills. This isn't the first time a bird has found itself in an aquatic situation. In 2011, there was another similar encounter at the city's North Avenue Beach, where a great horned owl, who couldn't fly after being hit by a car, took to the water. The bird was rescued and nursed back to health by the Chicago Bird Collision Monitors. As for this grand horned owl, there has been no update on its condition after the incident. But, it is hoped that it was unharmed and made its way back into its habitat. The incident has brought much attention all over the world, and both locals and out-of-towners are now flocking to Loyola Park Beach to try and catch a glimpse of the rare bird. It's not every day that one sees a grand horned owl swimming in fresh water, and this was a unique moment for Spitzer to capture on camera. In conclusion, this was a fascinating glimpse into the world of bird behavior, showing how different species interact and how nature can sometimes take unexpected turns. Steve Spitzer was in the right place at the right time to capture a stunning and rare occurrence. It is an experience that he will remember for many years to come.
