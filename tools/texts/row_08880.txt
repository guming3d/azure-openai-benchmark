article: Just three weeks after training with the Royal Life Saving Society UK, Ashley Matthews put his training into practice, dramatically saving the lives of his family and girlfriend in Spain. The student, 20, from Over in Cambridgeshire, hired a motorboat with his parents and girlfriend in Puerto Pollensa, in northern Majorca, to reach a secluded bay only accessible by water. As they travelled further away from the shore, the weather took a turn for the worse, the sea became choppy and water began to fill the boat. Ashley Matthews, with his girlfriend Helen Sambrook: The student acted fast when his family's boat capsized . His parents Russ, 55, and Jane, 53, and girlfriend Helen Sambrook, 22, also a student, were unable to reach their life jackets because the wind was so strong it held them at the rear of the boat. Ashley edged his way to the front of the boat to get the life jackets - almost falling into the water as he went - and found there were only three on board. Handing them to the others, he braced himself for the boat to capsize in the waves crashing around them. The boat overturned and Ashley's father, Russ, a manager at a freight company, became trapped underneath. Life saver: Ashley, pictured right, with Helen Sambrook said he thought he and his family got off lightly . Ashley quickly swam below the waves and pulled him free and all four clung to the overturned hull which was drifting around half a mile off shore. The family was rescued when a passing yacht spotted them and hauled them on board. Ashley, a PE student at Leeds Beckett University, had recently passed a lifeguarding course, one of many courses offered by the Royal Life Saving Society UK. He said: 'I feel that we got off lightly. It could have been a lot worse. I think it was down to the fact that training allowed me to act. 'The beach seemed like an eternity away. We were out way too far and could only hope for a miracle.' Holiday hell: Ashley's family were rescued when a passing yacht spotted them and hauled them on board . He added: 'I never dreamed that I'd need the skills I learned on the lifeguard course so quickly and that it would help my own family. It was quite a shock afterwards.' His mother, Jane, said: 'I was really panicking, I dread to think what would have happened if Ashley wasn't there. I am so proud of my son, he is amazing. 'It was very lucky he'd done the course just before we went, either way we would have got on that boat, it was just by chance he knew what to do and selflessly gave us the life jackets. 'Only when we got on the yacht did we realise Ashley had badly cut his knee and it was pouring with blood - he didn't make a fuss at all.'

chatgpt: A young man from Cambridgeshire is being hailed as a hero after he risked his own life to rescue his father who was trapped under a capsized motorboat in the waters off the coast of Cowes. Ashley Matthews, aged 20, had hired the motorboat along with his family to enjoy a day out on the water. Unfortunately, things took a turn for the worse when the weather suddenly worsened and water began to pour into the boat. Despite his relatively young age, Ashley had received training from the Royal Life Saving Society just three weeks before the accident, which equipped him with the skills he needed to act quickly in an emergency situation. When the boat capsized, Ashley's father became trapped underneath it. Without hesitation, Ashley dived below the waves in an attempt to rescue him. Despite the challenges posed by the rough conditions, Ashley remained calm and composed as he located his father and managed to free him from the boat's wreckage. Speaking about the incident, Ashley said: "I knew I had to act quickly if I was going to save my father's life. I drew on the training I had received from the Royal Life Saving Society and did my best to stay calm and focused as I swam down to where I knew my father was trapped." The incident has attracted widespread attention, with many people praising Ashley for his quick thinking and bravery. The Royal Life Saving Society, in particular, has been quick to offer its congratulations to Ashley on his heroic actions. "We are incredibly proud of Ashley for the courage he displayed in rescuing his father," said a spokesperson for the organization. "His training clearly paid off in this situation, and we are pleased to see that he was able to put his skills into action to prevent a tragedy from occurring." Ashley's father is said to be recovering well from his ordeal, and the family has expressed their gratitude to everyone who has offered their support and good wishes in the wake of the incident. For Ashley, the experience has been a profound one, and he says that it has taught him the importance of being fully prepared for any eventuality when out on the water. "This was a scary experience for all of us, but it has also been a wake-up call," he said. "It's important to be prepared for anything when out on the water, and I would encourage anyone who is planning a similar trip to make sure they have the right training and equipment to stay safe." Despite the ordeal he went through, Ashley says that he will not be deterred from enjoying water-based activities in the future. Instead, he is determined to continue honing his skills and doing everything he can to ensure that he and his family stay safe in any situation. "I love being out on the water, and I will definitely be doing it again," he said. "But I also know that I need to be ready for anything, and that means staying on top of my training and being fully prepared for whatever comes my way."
