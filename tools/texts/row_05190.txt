article: Salt Lake City, Utah (CNN) -- The jury began deliberations Thursday in the trial of Brian David Mitchell, accused of kidnapping 14-year-old Elizabeth Smart in 2002. The jurors will decide whether Mitchell, 57, was legally insane when he snatched Smart at knifepoint from her bedroom on June 5, 2002. Smart testified at the monthlong trial that he led her to a makeshift camp in the canyons above her home, "sealed" her as his spiritual plural wife and raped her. U.S. District Dale Kimball instructed jurors that in order to acquit Mitchell under the insanity defense, they must determine he was mentally ill and that his illness was so severe it kept him from knowing right from wrong. Defense attorneys mounted the insanity defense for Mitchell, trying to convince jurors that Mitchell was so delusional he could not understand his actions were wrong when he abducted Smart. Several mental health experts testified for the defense, offering diagnoses that ranged from delusional to psychotic to paranoid schizophrenic. When a defendant acts out in court . Prosecutors produced their own mental health experts, who testified that Mitchell was little more than a narcissistic pedophile who used religious dogma and claims he received revelations from God to get what he wanted. Smart spent nine months with Mitchell and his legal wife, Wanda Barzee, at makeshift camps in the Utah mountains and at a homeless camp outside San Diego, California. Now 23, Smart was the star witness for the prosecution. She said Mitchell raped her nearly every day of her captivity, some days more than once. She initially was kept tethered between two trees and treated "like an animal," she testified. Later, she was allowed to accompany Mitchell and Barzee into town, but was forced to wear flowing religious robes and a veil. She was not permitted to speak to other people, she said. Mitchell claimed to be a prophet named Immanuel David Isaiah, who would take 49 wifes and battle the Antichrist in the end times. Afterward, his family would hold exalted positions in the new kingdom. Smart said her job was to teach the new wives how to perform sexually. She said Mitchell claimed she was preordained to be his wife but never spoke of his destiny with outsiders. Many times, she said, he used his revelations to justify drinking, smoking or viewing pornography. Mitchell, Smart and Barzee were stopped by police in Sandy, Utah, on March 12, 2003. Smart was reunited with her family, and Mitchell and Barzee were charged by state authorities. When those cases bogged down over whether they were mentally competent to stand trial, the case moved to federal court. Barzee, 64, reached a plea bargain and is serving 15 years in prison. She testified for the defense and described Mitchell as a manipulator who took advantage of her religious beliefs. CNN's Lena Jakobsson and Ann O'Neill contributed to this report.

chatgpt: After weeks of testifying from witnesses and evidence, the trial of Brian David Mitchell has come to a close. Both the defense and prosecution have rested in their case, leaving the fate of Mitchell in the hands of the jury. The central issue in the trial was whether Mitchell's mental problems kept him from knowing right from wrong. The defense argued that Mitchell was so delusional and mentally ill that he could not understand his actions were wrong. They presented a compelling argument, highlighting Mitchell's history of mental illness and bizarre behavior. On the other hand, prosecutors produced mental health experts who testified that Mitchell knew his actions were wrong. They argued that Mitchell was not so mentally ill that he didn't know right from wrong. They also presented evidence of Mitchell's premeditation, including his detailed plan to kidnap the victim and the effort he put into evading law enforcement. Throughout the trial, Mitchell's behavior was erratic and disruptive. He frequently interrupted proceedings and sang hymns loudly to himself. He reportedly even wore a self-made crown of thorns, further fueling his delusional beliefs. The case centered around the 2002 kidnapping of Elizabeth Smart, which lasted nine months. Mitchell and his wife, Wanda Barzee, abducted Smart from her bedroom and held her captive in the mountains. During her captivity, Smart was repeatedly raped and subjected to physical and emotional abuse. Smart, who was present in the courtroom during the trial, endured the traumatic experience with remarkable bravery. She testified against Mitchell, recounting the horrific abuse she experienced during her captivity. Her testimony was pivotal in the trial, serving as a heartbreaking reminder of the trauma she endured. The trial has been closely watched by the public due to the gruesome and disturbing nature of the crime. Mitchell's defense has raised questions about the role of mental illness in violent crime, igniting a national conversation about mental health and its connection to criminal behavior. As the jury deliberates, the outcome of the trial remains uncertain. Mitchell's delusional behavior and history of mental illness may influence the jury's decision. However, the presiding judge has made it clear that the jury must determine whether Mitchell was capable of understanding the wrongfulness of his actions at the time of the kidnapping. The trial has brought to light the importance of properly addressing mental illness and the potential consequences when it goes untreated. The tragic experience of Elizabeth Smart and the countless others affected by violent crimes serve as a stark reminder of the importance of mental health resources and support. The verdict of the trial will be a defining moment for the families affected by the kidnapping and a critical moment in the national conversation surrounding mental health and criminal behavior. As the jury deliberates, the nation awaits the outcome.
