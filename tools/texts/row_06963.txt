article: By . Louise Cheer . Growing up to 40cm in length, super-sized goldfish are lurking in Western Australian waterways. They are among the invasive feral fish of the Vasse River, south of Perth, with some growing to a massive 2kg after preying on native species. A pet goldfish normally grows to about 5cm in length. Dr Stephen Beatty holds up one of the goldfish that has spread to the Wilyabrup Brook that flows between Cape Naturaliste and Cape Leeuwin near Perth. One of the giant goldfish pulled from Perth's Vasse River. Some of them can measure up to 40cm and weigh 2kg . After being released into the wild by owners, the goldfish grow to super-size by gorging on native fish eggs and stir up algae blooms while they feed on the bottom of rivers. It seems the mutant goldfish have also spread to the Wilyabrup Brook, near Busselton, in Western Australia. But the brook is part of a different river system to the Vasse - the home of the world's fastest growing goldfish. There are fears the fish could spread further with some highly tolerant of salt water. A research fellow at Murdoch University's School of Veterinary and Life Sciences in Perth has helped to remove more than 1600 of the giant goldfish in the past decade and has been monitoring the growth rate of others. The average size of a pet goldfish is about 5cm, eight times smaller than the giant ones found in the Vasse River . 'They can grow up to 18cm in the first year, which is quite incredible,' Dr Stephen Beatty said. More... Argghh, it's alive!

The goldfish is just one of the feral fish species entering the south-west waterways where alien species are outnumbering local fish for the first time. About 80 percent of the fish introduced into Vasse River are aquarium species, usually kept as pets, thought to be released by owners. To track the movements of the goldfish, Dr Beatty and his colleagues implanted 21 of them with smaller replicas of acoustic tags normally used on great white sharks. The team also installed listening posts along the river similar to the ones used to find out when the predator is near a beach. It was part of a study they were doing last summer, the results of which will be published soon. The scientists also found the fish's breeding ground was in a wetland part of the Vasse. As part of their studies, Murdoch University scientists implanted 21 feral goldfish with smaller versions of tracking tags used on great white sharks . Goldfish normally live in freshwater. Dr Beatty said the study was useful because it would help find preventative measures to keep alien species from crossing into other waterways.

chatgpt: Giant goldfish reaching up to 40cm in length and weighing up to 2kg have been discovered in a river close to Perth, Western Australia. It has been revealed that these monstrous fish ballooned in size after gorging on native eggs within Vasse River. Researchers are worried that this strain of goldfish could soon spread to other habitats, posing a significant problem for native species. The discovery of these oversized fish has caused concern for the many native fish species in Vasse River, which could face severe competition from the goldfish. According to researchers, nearly 80% of these giant fish are introduced into waters by their owners. Goldfish have been known to grow to near-super sizes if they are overfed, and this is precisely what caused them to reach such enormous proportions in Vasse River. Goldfish are known for their hardy nature and their ability to survive in a wide range of environments, including saltwater. Such tolerance has raised concerns among ecologists, who fear that this trait could lead to the spread of the supersize goldfish to other river systems, posing a significant threat to the ecosystem. Researchers warn that the spread of these fish could lead to serious consequences for native fish species, who could be outcompeted by these giant fish in their natural habitats. It is, therefore, essential that appropriate measures be put in place to prevent the further spread of these fish. The discovery of the large goldfish has prompted researchers to examine the potential risks associated with the introduction of exotic species into domestic waterways. The fact that almost 80% of these fish are introduced by their owners highlights the importance of responsible pet ownership and the potential harm that pets can cause to the environment. The researchers also discovered that the giant goldfish found in the river did not suffer from any health issues. This fact is troubling since these fish could thrive in a new environment and reproduce, rapidly spreading across sensitive ecosystems. Goldfish have long been one of the most popular household pets worldwide, and it is not uncommon for pet owners to release them into nearby lakes and rivers when they become too large for their tanks. Invasive species like the Giant Vasse River goldfish can cause significant harm to the environment and the native species living within it. Governments and authorities can do little to control pet owners who release their pets into waterways. It is, therefore, crucial to raise more awareness about the dangers that exotic pets can pose to the environment, and the importance of responsible pet ownership should be emphasized. The discovery of these giant goldfish in Vasse River is not the first time such supersize fish have been found in Australian rivers. Similar incidents have also been reported in other countries worldwide. The trend of introducing exotic species into the environment is on the rise, and it is a problem that requires global attention. In conclusion, the discovery of these supersize goldfish in Vasse River poses a significant threat to the local ecosystem. The fact that almost 80% of these fish were found to have been introduced into the waterways by their owners underlines the importance of responsible pet ownership. The potential spread of these goldfish, given their tolerance to salt water, needs to be investigated, and measures should be put in place to prevent their spread. The welfare of both native and introduced species is in our hands, and it is essential that we become increasingly aware of the importance of our roles in preserving the natural world.
