article: (CNN) -- President Abraham Lincoln and his wife, Mary Todd, needed a baby-sitter. It was April 18, 1864, and the Lincolns had planned to go to a fair in Baltimore, returning the next day. They needed someone to watch their 11-year-old son, Tad. A newly published letter from Mrs. Lincoln requesting a sitter gives rare insight into the family's life inside the Lincoln White House, showing one way the family had to juggle their busy schedules, just like everyone else. The letter is being offered for sale by the Raab Collection, a dealer in historical documents, valued at $15,000. It's not long -- just one line -- but the signed letter is in the first lady's hand. "Hon. Mr. Harrington, We would like to have the services of Charles from today, at 2 P.M. until tomorrow at 11 A.M. Very Resp. Mrs. Lincoln." "Charles" was Charles Forbes, a Treasury Department employee who was detailed to the Lincolns and often served as the president's valet, footman, messenger or attendant, according to the Raab Collection. George Harrington was assistant secretary of the Treasury and Forbes' boss and handled personal financial matters for the Lincolns. "Children in the White House have always held a great fascination with the American people," said Nathan Raab, vice president of the Raab Collection. "It shows the president and first lady at their most personal, their most human." Mary Todd Lincoln ended up not going to the Baltimore event, likely too burdened with preparations for a reception the next night, the final White House reception of the season, Raab says. Forbes' close family relationship soured a year later when President Lincoln was assassinated. Forbes was seated outside the president's box at Ford's Theatre and was the one who allowed the assassin, John Wilkes Booth, to enter. Forbes and the president's guard then left for a drink, leaving Lincoln unattended, Raab says. Mary Todd Lincoln ended up blaming Forbes for her husband's death. "Lincoln," a film about the 16th president and his battle to end slavery, is up for 12 Academy Awards this year, including best picture. The ceremony is scheduled to be broadcast Sunday night.

chatgpt: A rare 1864 letter by Mary Todd Lincoln, the wife of the 16th President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln, has surfaced and is up for sale. The letter reportedly requests a babysitter for their young son, Tad, who was 11 years old at the time. Mary Todd Lincoln's letter expressed her need for a trustworthy and reliable caregiver for their son in order for her and her husband to attend a special event. Although the letter doesn't state explicitly what the event was, historians have speculated that it may have been an event related to Abraham Lincoln's re-election campaign as president. The letter, written on cream-colored paper and bearing the presidential address at the top, has been put up for sale with an estimated value of $15,000. It is considered a rare piece of history, as Mary Todd Lincoln is known to have destroyed much of her personal correspondence before her death in 1882. According to reports, the family was worried for Tad's safety as he was said to be a highly energetic and sometimes unpredictable child. In the letter, Mary Todd Lincoln writes, "We have concluded to go out for the evening & we want you to keep Tad company in our absence & to be with him until he goes to bed." She also requested that the caregiver bring along any games or toys that they thought would keep Tad entertained and quiet. Tad was the youngest of the four Lincoln children and was known for his fondness for animals and pranks. He was especially close to his father and reportedly played an active role in his re-election campaign. Sadly, Tad died at the age of 18 in 1871, just six years after his father's assassination. The letter provides a glimpse into the personal life of one of America's most iconic first families during a tumultuous time in the nation's history. It reveals the often-overlooked aspect of Abraham Lincoln's life as a father and family man, rather than just a politician and president. The letter is expected to generate interest from collectors and historians alike, as it provides a rare and personal insight into the life of the Lincoln family. The winning bidder will have the opportunity to own a tangible piece of American history and a window into the life of one of America's most beloved presidents.
