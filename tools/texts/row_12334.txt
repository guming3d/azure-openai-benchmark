article: Tourists will no longer have to hold their breath when they visit the loo at certain attractions in China as the country promises a ‘toilet revolution’ to improve standards. Western holidaymakers are often befuddled or disgusted when they first encounter a row of squat toilets on the floor, often with little separation or privacy. And with some facilities lacking or in awful shape, China’s tourism bosses have announced a three-year plan to install more than 33,000 sparkling new toilets at tourist sites and renovate a further 25,000 across the country. Western holidaymakers are often befuddled or disgusted when they first encounter a row of squat toilets . Li Jinzao, chairman of China’s National Tourism Administration, said toilets at sites and restaurants frequented by visitors will be cleaner and will meet the country’s three-star standard. He said the plan will see 13,000 new toilets installed in 2015. China’s Xinhua state news agency said the move follows the government’s acknowledgement that there aren’t enough toilets in tourist areas, some are still ‘dirty and chaotic’, and better management is needed. China plans to install more than 33,000 new toilets at tourist sites and renovate a further 25,000 . Increasing the number – and quality – of toilets is part of China’s ongoing efforts to grow its tourism industry and improve public infrastructure. Traditional water closets in China are squat toilets – holes in the ground or trenches where people do their business while squat elbow-to-elbow. People are required to bring their own toilet paper, and eye contact and conversation are best avoided. It is a primitive concept to Westerners who sit on porcelain thrones in privacy, although ‘Western-style’ sit-down toilets are common in China's tourist hotels.

chatgpt: China has some ambitious plans to boost its tourism sector by improving and modernizing its toilets. The country intends to install over 33,000 new toilets and renovate an additional 25,000 existing ones. The move is aimed at satisfying the needs of the millions of tourists that visit the country each year. Tourism bosses have vowed to ensure that the new toilets meet the country's three-star standard and are kept clean at all times. The initiative is part of a broader campaign that seeks to address the long-standing problem of poor toilet facilities in many parts of the country. In recent years, China's booming tourism industry has drawn criticism for the poor state of its toilet facilities, which have been described as dirty, smelly and inadequate. The campaign for better toilets has been ongoing for some time now, with the government allocating significant resources towards the cause. In 2015, the authorities pledged to build or renovate 100,000 toilets across the country within three years, a promise that was fulfilled two years ahead of schedule. The move to renovate and modernize China's toilets has been met with enthusiasm by tourists and locals alike. Many have taken to social media to express their delight at the government's efforts to improve the country's tourism infrastructure. The reaction has been particularly positive regarding the assurance that the new toilets will meet the three-star standard, which is a measure of hygiene and comfort. The new initiative is expected to have a significant impact on China's tourism industry, which has been growing rapidly in recent years. The country has long been a popular destination for travelers from all over the world, with many drawn to its rich history, culture and natural beauty. With the new and improved toilets in place, it is hoped that even more tourists will flock to the country to experience all that it has to offer. While there is still much work to be done in terms of improving the country's tourism infrastructure, the installation of new toilets and renovation of old ones is certainly a step in the right direction. With its stunning landscapes, ancient traditions, and rich cultural heritage, China has the potential to become one of the world's leading tourism destinations, and the new toilets will undoubtedly play an important role in achieving that goal.
