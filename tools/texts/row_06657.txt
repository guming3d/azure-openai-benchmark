Prince Charles claims the expense poured onto his 15-acre estate is a protest against 'fashionable vandalism' Prince Charles has admitted that critics may see his organic garden at Highgrove as an 'expensive indulgence', but insisted that it helps to heal 'damaged souls'. Launching an outspoken attack on the 'short-sighted' destruction of rare plants, fruit and vegetables, he defended the care and money he has lavished on the grounds of his country estate in Gloucestershire. Since buying Highgrove in 1980, Charles has transformed its once drab gardens by planting unusual British varieties of apples, restoring a wild flower meadow and allowing only natural fertilisers to be used. He said he saw his efforts as a reaction to the 'carnage of fashionable vandalism' that has left many once common shrubs, trees and farm animals on the endangered list. Writing in a foreword to a new book about his estate, the 65-year-old Prince said: 'In many ways the garden at Highgrove represents one very small attempt to heal the appallingly short-sighted damage done to the soil, the landscape and to our own souls. 'Some may not like it, others may scoff that it is not in the "real world" or is merely an expensive indulgence.' Highgrove's 15-acre grounds, which are open to visitors, also feature an 'ego garden' containing busts of Charles, a thatched tree house built for Princes William and Harry, and a 'stumpery' composed of dead trees.

chatgpt: A new book about Highgrove, the Gloucestershire estate of Prince Charles, is making headlines for its scathing criticism of modern gardening trends. The book's author, a longtime gardener and manager of Highgrove, blasts what he calls the "carnage of fashionable vandalism" in today's gardens. Since 1980, Highgrove has been a labor of love for Prince Charles and his team of dedicated gardeners. They have made it their mission to cultivate rare trees and plants, many of which are native to the UK but have fallen out of favor in recent decades. The result is a stunning 15-acre garden that has become known for its beauty and biodiversity. In addition to its rare flora, Highgrove is also home to a number of unique features that reflect Prince Charles's interests and hobbies. For example, the garden boasts several busts of the prince himself, as well as a number of thatched houses designed to provide a cozy retreat for his sons. Despite its many charms, Highgrove and its team of gardeners have not been immune to criticism from the wider gardening community. Many of the trends that have become popular in recent years, such as minimalist landscapes and artificial lawn substitutes, are viewed with disdain by the book's author. He argues that many of these trends are not only unattractive, but also harmful to the environment. For example, the use of non-native plants and materials can disrupt local ecosystems and lead to the extinction of native species. In contrast, the lush and diverse landscape of Highgrove is a testament to the power of careful stewardship and preservation. By cultivating rare and endangered plants, Prince Charles and his team of gardeners are helping to ensure that these species are not lost forever. The book has already received praise and criticism from both gardening enthusiasts and members of the royal family. Some see it as a wake-up call for the gardening world, while others view it as an overly critical attack on modern trends. Regardless of one's opinion of the book, it is clear that Highgrove and its team of gardeners have created something truly special. Their dedication to preserving rare and endangered plants, and their commitment to sustainable gardening practices, sets an example for gardeners around the world. As Prince Charles himself has said, "gardening gives a sense of peace and calm, and it is a perfect remedy for combating stress and depression." It is our hope that the stunning gardens of Highgrove will continue to inspire and delight visitors for generations to come.
