chatgpt: The wife of a local farmer and father-of-four has shared the harrowing story of how her husband was attacked by a crocodile while fishing on the Adelaide River in the Northern Territory. The couple, who had only been living in Australia for just over a year, were enjoying a day out on the river when the crocodile struck. Mrs Le recalls the horrific moment when her husband, Mr. Tran, was taken by the crocodile. "He was fishing off the back of the boat and suddenly we heard a big splash," she said. "We turned around and saw the crocodile had grabbed him by the leg and was dragging him into the water." Despite Mrs. Le's efforts to fight off the crocodile with a fishing rod, it was too powerful and took her husband under the water. "I was screaming and crying for help, but there was nothing I could do," she said. Tragically, Mr. Tran's leg was later found inside the dead crocodile, and his body was discovered downstream. In the wake of the attack, Mrs. Le is now fighting for the government to consider a crocodile cull. "We need to do something to stop these attacks from happening," she said. "We can't keep putting people's lives at risk like this." Crocodile attacks are not uncommon in the Northern Territory, with several reported incidents each year. However, this attack has particularly shocked the local community, as Mr. Tran was a well-liked and respected member of the community. The Northern Territory government has previously rejected calls for a crocodile cull, arguing that it would not be effective in reducing the number of attacks. Instead, they have implemented a crocodile management program, which includes the removal of problem crocodiles from popular waterways. Despite this, Mrs. Le believes that more needs to be done to protect people from these dangerous animals. "My husband was a victim of this crocodile, and I don't want anyone else to suffer the same fate," she said. The community has rallied around Mrs. Le and her family in the wake of this tragedy, with many offering their condolences and support. "This is a terrible loss for our community," said local resident John Smith. "Our thoughts are with Mrs. Le and her family during this difficult time." As the debate over crocodile management in the Northern Territory continues, Mrs. Le remains determined to seek justice for her late husband and ensure that no one else suffers the same fate at the jaws of a crocodile.
