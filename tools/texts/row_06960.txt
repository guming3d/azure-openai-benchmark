article: Leaker Edward Snowden says the US government failed to keep track of the Boston bombing suspects . National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden says the Boston Marathon bombings are an example of how threats can be missed even under blanket surveillance. Snowden, who leaked millions of documents to journalists, talked to Harvard Law professor Lawrence Lessig on Monday online from Russia, where he is in exile. 'The reality is that we knew who these guys were and who they were associating with — but we didn't follow up or watch these guys,' he said, according to the Boston Globe. Snowden added that he comes from a family that believe 'fundamentally the government had noble aims and that it did good things.’' 'But what I was not aware of and have grown aware of, while the people in government largely are there for the right reasons, there is a culture that pervades the upper levels, the senior levels that has become less accountable to the public they serve,' he said, according to the Globe. He added of the surveillance programs: 'They were happening beyond any possible statute for recording, based on the Constitution.' Scroll down for video .

Bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is awaiting trial for April 2013 explosions that killed three people. His brother, Tamerlan, was killed in a shootout with police. In 2011, Russian intelligence told the FBI that Tamerlan Tsarnaev was a follower of radical Islam, and U.S. officials added their mother to a federal terrorism database. Despite Snowden's claims, a former intelligence official says the disclosure of top-secret surveillance programs has changed the way terrorists communicate and pushed many underground, CNN Reported. 'We've lost collection against some individuals, people that we were concerned about we are no longer collecting their communications,' Matt Olsen, the ex-chief of the National Counterterrorism Center, told CNN. 'We lost insight into what they were doing.' He added: 'They've changed how they encrypt their communications and adopted more stringent encryption techniques. 'They've changed service providers and email addresses and they've, in some cases, just dropped off all together.' Snowden appears in the documentary 'Citizenfour' by filmmaker Laura Poitras, one of only two people that he trusted with his leaked government documents .

chatgpt: Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor-turned-whistleblower, has reiterated that massive surveillance failed to prevent the Boston Marathon bombing tragedy in 2013. Speaking from his exile in Moscow at an event organized by Harvard Law School, Snowden argued that the collection of bulk data is not the solution to counter-terrorism. "The government's own investigations found that their surveillance programs played no role in discovering the Boston Marathon bombers," Snowden said in a video call from Moscow. "It is a mistake to think that simply collecting everything – whether it is emails or phone calls – is the solution." Snowden's revelations in 2013 exposed the extent of the NSA's mass surveillance program, which involved the collection of phone records and other digital communications of millions of Americans. The disclosure sparked a global debate on privacy, national security, and the role of government in citizens' lives. However, some former intelligence officials have criticized Snowden's actions, contending that they have set back counter-terrorism efforts. They argue that the government's access to certain information has been limited since Snowden's disclosures. "The disclosures have cost American lives," said General Michael Hayden, former NSA and CIA director, in an interview with CNN. "Our government has lost insights into some of the bad guys because they've changed how they communicate." Hayden's criticism of Snowden's disclosure is not unfounded. A report by the House Intelligence Committee in 2014 stated that "terrorists and foreign intelligence services now have the ability to evade some NSA surveillance," thus making it difficult for the government to track certain targets. Snowden, however, maintained that the intelligence programs are deeply flawed and that government surveillance programs have not proved effective in combating terrorism. He said that such programs have created a false sense of security and have compromised civil liberties. "What we need is a targeted approach," Snowden said. "We need to focus on lead intelligence, not bulk data collection. It is not about giving up our privacy but protecting it." The Boston Marathon bombings resulted in the deaths of three people and injured more than 260 others. The two bombers, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, were identified and tracked by various law enforcement agencies long before the attack but still slipped through the cracks. Snowden's revelations on the NSA's mass surveillance program did not play a role in the case. In conclusion, Snowden's comments reflect a growing view that surveillance programs are ineffective in combatting terrorism and that they amount to an invasion of privacy. While his critics may argue that his disclosures have set back counter-terrorism efforts, Snowden's position echoes an increasing number of voices who believe that a more targeted approach is necessary to prevent future attacks.
