article: 'Menacing': Romanian pimp Marcel Vasile, 36, has been brought to justice five years on following an international manhunt . A Romanian pimp who ‘bought’ a woman from sex traffickers and then forced her into prostitution has been jailed for 15 years. Marcel Vasile, 36, has been convicted five years after she was sold by father-and-son duo Bogdan and Marius Nejloveanus following an international manhunt. Vasile, described as a 'calculating, menacing character' with little regard for women, raped his 23-year-old victim and made her work in massage parlours. He was jailed after being found guilty of rape, controlling prostitution and trafficking. The woman was one of six brought to Britain by the Nejloveanus, who are also from Romania. In early 2008, she was sold to Vasile, a London-based pimp who was on the run from a sex trafficking case in Spain, because she was fighting the Nejloveanus' attempts to exploit her. The Nejloveanus then went on to supply other women to massage parlours in Manchester. They used the example of the victim they had ‘sold’ to scare the other trafficked women. Father and son were jailed in 2011, but Vasile remained at large until last year, when Manchester detectives brought him back from Spain to face charges of rape, controlling prostitution and trafficking within the UK. Vasile, of no fixed address, had denied the offences, but was found guilty following a trial at Manchester Crown Court. Passing sentence, Judge Robert Atherton told him: 'You demonstrated little regard not only for her, but for women in general.' The capture of Vasile brings to an end a long-running Greater Manchester Police investigation which began in October 2008, when police learned the Nejloveanus had been supplying trafficked women to massage parlours in the city. Their victims told police of a sixth woman who had been sold to Marcel Vasile, who was identified only as a 'gypsy in London' at the time. By then the woman had escaped from Vasile and returned to Romania after running away from the massage parlour in London where he had forced her to work. She had told police in the capital of her ordeal, but they let Vasile go without charge after she was too scared to press charges. After learning of this, the Manchester detectives decided to hunt him down. 'Menacing': Vasile was jailed for 15 years after being convicted of rape, trafficking and controlling prostitution following a trial at Manchester Crown Court . Using his fingerprint they managed to get his real name from the authorities in his native Romania, who confirmed he had been extradited to Spain. In December last year Vasile was brought back from Spain, where he was serving time for other trafficking offences, using a European arrest warrant. The court heard he was first convicted of sex trafficking in Romania in 1996. Detective Constable Colin Ward said: 'Vasile is a calculating, menacing character who has shown not an ounce of remorse.'

chatgpt: Marcel Vasile, a 36-year old Romanian national, has been convicted of rape, controlling prostitution, and trafficking following a trial at a British court. The victim in this case was a Romanian woman who had been brought to the UK by Vasile and his accomplices.  According to the prosecution, Vasile raped the victim and then forced her to work in massage parlours as a prostitute. The defendant, along with his father and a son, was involved in trafficking the woman to the UK, where she was forced to work in the sex trade. During the trial, the court heard how Vasile had used violence and coercion to control the victim. She had been subjected to physical assaults and threats of further harm if she did not comply with his demands.  The prosecution argued that the victim was in a vulnerable and helpless position, having been brought to the UK against her will. Despite the defense team's attempt to discredit the victim's testimony, the jury found Vasile guilty on all counts, and he was sentenced to a total of 14 years in prison. The case highlights the prevalence of human trafficking and exploitation in the UK, particularly within the sex industry. Many victims are brought to the country under false pretenses, with promises of a better life, only to be subjected to exploitation and abuse. Speaking after the verdict, Detective Inspector Dan Ives, of the Metropolitan Police, said: "Vasile is a dangerous individual who used violence and threats to control his victim. He thought he could exploit her for his own gain, but justice has now been served." He added, "I hope this case sends a clear message that we will not tolerate human trafficking and exploitation in our communities. We will continue to work tirelessly to identify and bring to justice those responsible for these heinous crimes." The case also highlights the need for greater public awareness about human trafficking and exploitation. Individuals who suspect someone is being exploited or subjected to abuse should report their concerns to the authorities immediately. Victims of human trafficking and exploitation are often too afraid to come forward, but it is important that they know help is available. There are numerous organizations and charities providing support and assistance to vulnerable individuals who have been subjected to these crimes. In conclusion, the conviction of Marcel Vasile is a victory for justice and sends a clear message to those who engage in human trafficking and exploitation. It is crucial that we continue to raise awareness about this issue and provide support to victims, ensuring that they receive the help and assistance they need to rebuild their lives.
