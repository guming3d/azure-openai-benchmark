Taylor had to be substituted after rupturing his achilles tendon during his side's 3-3 draw with Burnley . Taylor has revealed he is due to have an operation next Wednesday and confirmed he will be out of action for the remainder of the season. He wrote on Sportlobster: 'Gutted to say I'm going to be out for the season. I ruptured my achilles in the last game. 'Thankfully it wasn't the one I did a few years ago. I'll have an operation on it on Wednesday but won't make it back now for the rest of this season. 'I know what to do in the rehab from last time and will come back fitter and stronger than before.' Carver said after his first game in temporary charge of Newcastle following Alan Pardew's move to Crystal Palace: 'Unfortunately, we have lost Steven Taylor. It looks like he has ruptured his achilles tendon - and it's not the one he did previously, so I think that's the end of him now for the season. 'I have known Steven since he was in the Centre of Excellence and he is a great lad. It was great for him to get the goal at a set-play, it was set up for him. 'But when he landed, you could tell the way he landed it was something to do with the calf or achilles and unfortunately it's not looking good.'

chatgpt: Newcastle United’s Steven Taylor will require surgery on the injury he sustained against Burnley. The central defender was taken off in the 60th minute after suffering an injury during the match at St. James’ Park on Tuesday. Taylor’s injury news will come as a major blow to Newcastle United’s bid to remain in the Premier League. Manager John Carver had earlier feared that Taylor would be out for the rest of the season. Taylor, who has started in all of Newcastle's last three matches, will now be out for a significant period of time. Speaking about the injury, Taylor said that he was ‘gutted’ but hoped to come back stronger. Surgery is set to take place within the next few days, and the recovery period is expected to take several months. The team has not yet confirmed a timeline for Taylor’s return. Taylor has been a key player for Newcastle United this season, featuring in 18 games in the Premier League. He has been a rock at the back, providing stability to the defense, which has been one of the club’s strengths this season. Despite the injury setback, Newcastle United remains confident of securing a place in the Premier League next season. The club currently sits in 13th place in the league table with 22 points, just five points clear of the relegation zone. The management is already looking for a replacement for Taylor, as the team will have to rely on their backups in the coming weeks. The team’s next match is against Chelsea, and it remains to be seen who will be chosen to replace Taylor in the starting lineup. Taylor's absence will also provide an opportunity for some of the lesser used players to make an impact. With less than half of the Premier League campaign still to play, Newcastle United must put their best foot forward and secure as many points as they can to avoid the drop. In conclusion, Taylor’s injury is a significant setback for Newcastle United, but the club remains upbeat about their chances to retain their place in the Premier League. The news of Taylor’s successful recovery will surely boost the morale of the team and its supporters.
