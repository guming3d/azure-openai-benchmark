chatgpt: Tourist captures landslide on camera at Sidmouth beach A tourist visiting Sidmouth beach in the UK was able to capture the moment a landslide occurred on camera. The incident happened on Wednesday afternoon and was witnessed by Tony Lane, who said he heard pebbles start to fall before rocks crashed down. Mr Lane was able to film the landslide as it happened and later uploaded the footage onto social media. The video shows a cloud of dust and debris being kicked up as the rocks come crashing down the cliff face and onto the beach below. The landslide has since prompted police to issue a warning to members of the public calling for them to avoid a section of the beach where a tourist was killed in a cliff fall back in 2018. The warning serves as a reminder of the dangers that can happen on the coastline, and the need to take appropriate precautions. The section of beach that police are calling for people to stay away from is located to the east of the town's esplanade towards the mouth of the River Sid. Despite the warning, however, some members of the public have still been seen visiting the area, with police and coastguard officials both expressing their concern. Commenting on the incident, Mark Rodway, Senior Maritime Operations Officer at HM Coastguard, said: "We cannot stress enough the importance of heeding warning signs and staying away from dangerous areas. The cliffs along the coastline can be unstable and unpredictable, and accidents can happen in a matter of seconds." The warning follows the death of a 47-year-old man who was killed in a cliff fall at the same location in 2018. The man, who has not been named, was visiting the area with his family when he fell around 100 feet from the cliff above. His death was later ruled as accidental by the coroner. Despite the risks, Sidmouth beach remains a popular destination for visitors, with many taking in the stunning views of the coastline and the Jurassic Cliffs. However, with incidents like these serving as a reminder of the dangers that exist, it's vital that visitors take appropriate precautions and stay away from dangerous areas. As the coastguard continues to monitor the situation at Sidmouth beach, locals have called for greater warning signs and information to be provided to visitors. With the summer season now in full swing, it's hoped that steps can be taken to ensure that all visitors to the area can enjoy a safe and enjoyable experience.  In conclusion, visitors to Sidmouth beach are urged to take extra caution and follow warning signs as the coastline proves to be unpredictable and dangerous.
