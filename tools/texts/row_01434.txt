Matching mother-daughter Halloween costumes can often be charming, cute, or both. But they can also be considered downright offensive, especially if the matching costume is 'white trash,' and it's worn to an elementary school Halloween event. A mother-daughter duo in metro Detroit did exactly that - and the reaction from parents and students were probably not what they had in mind. The pair wore their costumes to Huron Park Elementary School's 'Trunk or Treat' Halloween celebration in Roseville on Thursday evening. 'White trash': This 'white trash' Halloween costume has irked some parents at a Michigan elementary school . To become 'white trash,' the pair simply donned plain white trash bags - over black sweatshirts - with the words 'white trash' scrawled on them. Additionally, they painted their faces white with a smeared coat of black paint near their eyes. 'I was a little appalled. To me, how can you dress yourself and your . child in a white trash outfit?' parent Nicole Ekmeian said to MyFoxDetroit.com. The area where the school is located is a suffering economically like much of the rest of the city of Detroit, which recently declared bankruptcy. This has added even more fuel to the outrage of parents at the school, as the offensive slur 'white trash' has often crept its way into the area. Offensive: one parent said she was appalled that the pair would wear such an offensive Halloween costume . 'Roseville is known for "white trash" and you just don't do that at a kids function,' says mom Megan Manchenko. 'You can't have weapons; you can't have blood; you can't have gory stuff, but racial slurs? Go right ahead!' One person, however, didn't understand what all the fuss is about. 'I don't get offended easily,' Eric Frasier told the station. 'There's more important things in this world right now - people are out of jobs, people are homeless and not eating. Lighten up.' The school's principal said he confronted the mother about the costume, but noted that it's hard to make parents abide by the same rules as the students. Detroit: One mother said this section of Detroit is often called 'white trash,' making the costume even more offensive . Last week, the University of Colorado at Boulder told students to not wear Halloween costumes that it deemed offensive, or to be a 'crude stereotype.' On the list are cowboys, Indians, anything with a sombrero, anything 'ghetto' and anything 'white trash.' 'Making the choice to dress up as someone from another culture, either with the intention of being humorous or without the intention of being disrespectful, can lead to inaccurate and hurtful portrayals of other people's cultures,' Dean of Students Christina Gonzeles wrote in a letter to students.

chatgpt: A Michigan mother is facing backlash after dressing her daughter in a controversial Halloween costume. The elementary school student arrived at classroom festivities dressed in a costume deemed offensive by other parents in attendance. The student's mother outfitted her child in attire that portrayed her as a member of a group frequently derided with a racial slur. Parents in attendance were taken aback, with some expressing outrage and disappointment at the mother's decision. Reports indicate that the incident occurred at an elementary school in a Detroit suburb. According to one mother who spoke to a local news outlet, the derogatory slur associated with the costume is commonly used to describe the town's residents. She called the mother's decision to dress her daughter in such attire "appalling." The school's principal weighed in on the controversy, acknowledging that he had spoken with the mother in question. However, he notes that it can be difficult to get parents to follow the same rules as their children.  "We're working to ensure that all students understand and follow our community values," he said. "Unfortunately, sometimes parents don't share those same values, and it creates situations like this." The incident has ignited a conversation about how communities address potentially racially insensitive costumes and other discriminatory behavior at school events. Some parents have called for stricter guidelines around Halloween dress code, while others have expressed concern that their children may be exposed to harmful language or attitudes at school. Regardless, the incident serves as a reminder of the importance of promoting an inclusive and welcoming school environment. Schools must work to ensure that all students feel comfortable and respected, and that behaviors or costumes that marginalize or offend certain groups are not acceptable. As the Halloween season approaches, it is likely that many schools will grapple with similar issues around dress code and cultural sensitivity. It is up to educators and administrators to set guidelines and expectations for parents and students alike, and to foster a culture of understanding and inclusion within their communities.
