article: Aston Villa's summer of upheaval continued on Tuesday with the club confirming Paul Faulkner has stepped down as chief executive. At the end of last season owner Randy Lerner put Villa up for sale as the American decided he had spent enough in attempting to raise the club's profile and fortunes. Several weeks ago the club also sacked assistant manager Ian Culverhouse and head of football operations Gary Karsa following an internal investigation into off-field issues. Boss Paul Lambert has since appointed Roy Keane as his new assistant, but the loss of Faulkner serves as another blow to the midlands outfit.

Although Lerner and Faulkner have worked closely together for many years, with the latter involved in a variety of roles in the former's many businesses, the two have now gone their separate ways. It follows a failure to reach an agreement on Faulkner's future as the club claim, via a statement, he had hoped to 're-engage with Lerner's broader business while remaining involved with Villa in a non-operational role'. Faulkner has parted on good terms, and has offered his support to Villa to ensure a smooth transition. Robin Russell, appointed by Lerner in 2006 as chief financial officer, has stepped in as acting chief executive. Faulkner said: 'I would like to thank Randy for the opportunity to become involved with Aston Villa and for the relationship we built over the years, which pre-dated my time at the club. 'To the Villa fans, I am grateful for their support over the years, and for their passionate love for, and loyalty to, this great club which deserves the very best. 'I would like to make particular reference to the wonderful Villa staff both at Bodymoor Heath and Villa Park. 'They are an incredible group of people and it's been a privilege to lead and work with them on a daily basis. 'Villa is best in class in so many ways off the field, and I only hope that success on the pitch follows. 'I feel very humbled to have been able to spend such a long period of time amongst such special people at such a special club and I wish them, Paul Lambert and the squad all the very best for the future as I look to embark on the next stage of my career and a new challenge.' In response, Lerner said: 'Paul has been fantastic in his role at Villa and more broadly as a colleague over the years. I offer him my deepest thanks.'

chatgpt: Aston Villa announced on Monday that Robin Russell will serve as their interim chief executive, following the departure of Paul Faulkner. Russell will take on the role effective immediately and continue until the club can identify a permanent replacement. Faulkner's exit comes after a tumultuous period for Aston Villa, which saw owner Randy Lerner put the club up for sale at the end of last season. This was followed by the sacking of assistant manager Ian Culverhouse and head of football operations Gary Karsa in April. Russell has been a board member of Aston Villa for the past three years and is seen as a trusted insider within the club. He is a chartered accountant by trade and has held a number of senior finance roles in the UK over the past 20 years, including as CFO of Ryland Group and Midlands Expressway. The announcement of Russell's appointment was made on the same day as Aston Villa's pre-season friendly against FC Dallas. During the match, supporters could be heard chanting for Lerner to leave the club. It has been a difficult period for Aston Villa fans, who have seen their team struggle on the pitch in recent years. The club narrowly avoided relegation from the Premier League last season, and there have been concerns about the lack of investment in the playing squad. In addition, the uncertainty over the club's ownership has led to a sense of frustration among supporters. Lerner has been looking to sell Aston Villa for some time now, but has yet to find a buyer who can meet his asking price. Despite these challenges, Russell remains optimistic about Aston Villa's future. "It is an honor to have been asked to take on this role during what is an important time for the club," he said in a statement. "There is much work to be done, but I am confident that with the support of our fans, we can continue to build for the future." The announcement of Russell's appointment was met with a mixed response from Aston Villa supporters. Some saw it as a positive move, while others expressed disappointment that the club had not been able to attract someone with more football experience. Regardless of the reaction, Russell will be under pressure to help turn around Aston Villa's fortunes. With the Premier League season just a few weeks away, there is little time to waste. The club will be hoping that Russell can provide the stability and leadership needed to steer them through what promises to be another challenging season.
