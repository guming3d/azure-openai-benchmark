article: Los Angeles (CNN) -- Singer Bobby Brown faces his second drunken driving charge this year after a Los Angeles police officer pulled him over in the Studio City community early Wednesday, police said. The officer smelled "a strong scent of alcohol" when he approached Brown during the Ventura Boulevard traffic stop, prompting a field sobriety test, a police spokesman said. After the test, Brown was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol and booked into a jail, the police spokesman said. He was released on bond about seven hours later, he said. Brown's representative did not immediately respond to a CNN call for comment. Photos: Celebrity mug shots . Brown checked into a "confidential rehabilitation center" in August for treatment "relating to alcohol use," his spokesman said at the time. Brown, 43, agreed to enter a 90-day alcohol treatment program when he pleaded no contest in Los Angeles County to driving with a blood alcohol content of .08% or higher in April. He also was sentenced to 36 months of probation, according to his attorney, Tiffany Feder. Brown married Alicia Etheridge, his manager, in a ceremony in Hawaii in June. The couple got engaged in 2010 at a New Edition concert after dating for close to three years. They have a 3-year-old son, Cassius. He admitted himself to the rehab proram three weeks after concluding his honeymoon in Mexico and during a break from the New Edition tour, his spokesman said. Brown was previously married to the late Whitney Houston, who he divorced in 2007. In addition to Cassius, Brown has one daughter, Bobbi Kristina, from his relationship with Houston, as well as three other children. Brown has been touring this year with his group New Edition. The R&B artist released "Masterpiece," his first solo album in 14 years, in June. CNN's Jane Caffrey contributed to this report.
