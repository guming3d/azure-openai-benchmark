chatgpt: On Wednesday, Eric Williams, a former justice of the peace, was sentenced to death for killing Cynthia McLelland. Williams was also charged in the deaths of her husband, District Attorney Mike McLelland, and prosecutor Mark Hasse, but has not yet been tried for those crimes. The conviction and sentencing come in the wake of a revenge plot that Williams is believed to have hatched after losing his job and law license. McLelland and Hasse prosecuted Williams for theft and burglary, resulting in the loss of his job and the revocation of his law license. Williams reportedly held a grudge against the two prosecutors and sought revenge for what he perceived as an unjust prosecution. On March 30, 2013, Williams and his wife, Kim, entered the McLelland's home and shot and killed both Cynthia and Mike McLelland. While Williams was on trial, prosecutors argued that he planned and carried out these murders as an act of revenge. They presented evidence showing that Williams purchased the same type of ammunition used to kill the McLellands and that he accessed the Texas Department of Public Safety's crime database to research his potential victims. The prosecution also argued that Williams had used his legal expertise to cover up his tracks and try to evade detection. For Williams, the death sentence is the culmination of a lengthy legal battle. His trial began in late October, and it took the jury just a few hours to deliver a guilty verdict. The same jury took another few hours to decide on the death penalty over a life sentence. "This is a tragic case that showcases the worst of human nature," said prosecutor Bill Wirskye. "Eric Williams was a man who became consumed with rage and plotted to take revenge on those who he felt had wronged him. His actions left a trail of death and devastation that will never be forgotten." Williams' lawyer argued that his client was mentally unstable and that his actions were not premeditated. He plans to appeal the verdict. The sentencing marks the end of a chapter in a gruesome series of crimes that rocked the town of Kaufman, Texas. While some level of justice has been served, loved ones of the victims cannot help but wonder what might have been had Williams not lost his job and his law license.
