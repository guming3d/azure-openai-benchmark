article: (CNN) -- The Israeli air force conducted a strike in Lebanon between Beirut and Sidon on Friday, a day after rockets struck northern Israel, the Israeli Defense Forces said Friday. There were no casualties in the Israeli strike, which stirred memories of the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite militant group. The IDF described the launch of rockets targeting Israel as a "terrorist aggression originating from Lebanese territory." Lebanon's National News Agency said the Israeli strike occurred at dawn Friday in al-Naama, about 15 kilometers (10 miles) south of Beirut. Cross-border fire has been rare since the Israel-Hezbollah war. The IDF believes that global jihadist elements were behind the rocket fire on Thursday into Israel, which was launched from a village south of the Lebanese city of Tyre, IDF spokesman Eytan Buchman said. The strike hit a site belonging to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, according to Lebanon's National News Agency. The group has long been a pro-Syrian government movement. The cross-border fire comes amid anxiety in Lebanon over the Syrian civil war. A bombing near a mosque killed at least 13 people in the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli, where there has been sectarian division over Syria. Popular Front official Abu Imad Ramez Mustafa confirmed the Israeli raid, adding that "the raid targeted the valley and did not target PFLP sites." "Israel has always sought strife," he was quoted as saying by the Lebanese news agency. The Popular Front General Command maintains facilities in the area, and the National News Agency said a network of tunnels belonging to the group was hit. The Israeli attack comes in response to an attack Thursday in which four rockets were fired from southern Lebanon at northern Israel, with two of them landing in populated areas, the Israel Defense Forces said. It wasn't immediately clear where the two rockets landed. They caused property damage, but no one was hurt, the Israeli military said. One rocket was intercepted by Israel's missile defense system between the northern Israeli cities of Nahariya and Acre, the IDF said. Information on the fourth rocket wasn't immediately available. Earlier, the military said that all the rockets besides the intercepted one fell outside Israeli territory. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised his nation would respond. The attack prompted a halt to all civilian aerial activity in northern Israel, the IDF's Buchman said.

chatgpt: Popular Front confirms attack, Israel launches rocket attack on Lebanon in response The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC) has confirmed carrying out a rocket attack on northern Israel on Thursday. The group said that the attack targeted military bases and was carried out in response to recent Israeli attacks on Gaza and Syria. While the PFLP-GC claimed responsibility for the attack, it also confirmed that there were no casualties. In a statement, the group said that its fighters had successfully carried out the operation and returned safely to their base. Israel, on the other hand, responded to the attack by launching a rocket attack on Lebanon between Beirut and Sidon. The Israel Defense Force (IDF) said that the attack was a response to four rockets fired from Lebanon on Thursday, two of which caused damage but no loss of life. The IDF said that the rockets were fired by a Palestinian group based in Lebanon and that it held the Lebanese government responsible for the attack. "The IDF views this as a grave incident and holds the Lebanese government responsible for any attacks emanating from Lebanon," said an IDF spokesperson. The rocket attack on Lebanon came amid rising tensions in the region, with Israel launching a series of airstrikes on Syria in recent weeks. The strikes, which targeted Iranian-backed militias and infrastructure, were carried out in response to rocket attacks on Israeli territory. Israel has also been conducting a military campaign in Gaza in response to rocket fire from the coastal enclave. The campaign has so far claimed the lives of over 200 Palestinians, including children and civilians. The situation in the region remains tense, with both sides accusing each other of aggression. The Lebanese government has condemned the Israeli rocket attack and called on the international community to intervene. "The government of Lebanon condemns the Israeli aggression and stresses the need for the international community to stop Israeli violations of Lebanese sovereignty," said a statement from the Lebanese government. The rocket attack on Lebanon has raised fears of a wider conflict in the region, with both sides seemingly prepared to escalate the situation. It remains to be seen whether the international community can intervene and bring an end to the tensions before they spiral out of control.
