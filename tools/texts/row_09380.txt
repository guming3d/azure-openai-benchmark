Heaven Woods, five, was found unresponsive in the home of her mother’s boyfriend in Forsyth, Georgia, on Tuesday and later died in hospital as a result of blunt force trauma to her abdomen. The family of Amanda Hendrickson, 33, a mother of several children and pregnant with another, are now calling for the death penalty if she is involved in her daughter’s death. Charged: Amanda Hendrickson, 33, and her boyfriend Roderick Buckner, 34, faces felony first-degree child cruelty charges over the homicide of Hendrickson's daughter Heaven Woods, five . Heaven was found unresponsive in a home in Forsyth, belonging to Hendrickson’s boyfriend where the five-year-old and her mother had been living for the past month, and later died in hospital. An autopsy revealed she was killed by blunt force trauma to her abdomen and that she was suffering from both new and old injuries. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is now investigating the death as a homicide, and have also arrested Hendrickson’s boyfriend. The GBI said Hendrickson has a ‘history’ with the Georgia Department of Family and Children Services in their previous home town of Rome, and family members told a local news channel that she has several children and is pregnant with another child. Hendrickson’s Facebook page backs this statement, showing pictures of a recent ultrasound as well as images of Heaven as a baby. Devastated: Hendrickson¿s mother Lisa Coursey says her daughter, who is pregnant and has a history with local child services, should 'rot in hell' if she is involved in the death of five-year-old Heaven . According to family members, Heaven had previously been seen with visible evidence of physical abuse, but Ms Hendrickson had found explanations for them, such as falling over due to clumsiness. When Heaven's grandmother noticed a bruise in the shape of a hand on the girls' throat, Ms Hendrickson said the girl had tried to choke herself. Yesterday Hendrickson’s mother Lisa Coursey, and her half-sister Ashley Coursey, 21, called for the death penalty. “I want justice for my granddaughter,’ Ms Coursey told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ‘If she [her daughter] did this, she should rot in H-E-L-L.’ Hendrickson has been arrested on charges of felony child cruelty in the first degree and giving false statements. Her boyfriend Roderick Buckner, 34, also faces felony first-degree child cruelty charges. Authorities say additional charges are expected to be filed against both Hendrickson and Buckner, and the couple is being held without bond in the Monroe County Justice Center.

chatgpt: Tragedy struck in Forsyth, Georgia on Monday when Heaven Woods, a five-year-old girl, was found unresponsive by her mother, Amanda Hendrickson. Despite being rushed to the hospital, Heaven tragically passed away later that day due to blunt force trauma to the abdomen. Her death has resulted in charges being filed against both her mother and her mother's boyfriend, 34-year-old Roderick Buckner. The autopsy report revealed that not only had Heaven suffered from recent injuries, but she also had evidence of older injuries that had not been properly addressed. This has led authorities to believe that her death was not a sudden and accidental occurrence, but rather a result of sustained abuse. It is unclear at this time how long Heaven had been suffering from the abuse, but the authorities have stated that the investigation is ongoing. Both Hendrickson and Buckner have been charged with Heaven's death and are currently awaiting trial. Hendrickson has also raised concerns after it was revealed that she is allegedly pregnant. Many are questioning whether Hendrickson is fit to care for another child given her alleged involvement in her daughter's tragic death. The community is in mourning for Heaven and her loss has raised questions surrounding child abuse and how to prevent it. It is crucial to recognize the signs of abuse and report any suspicions to local authorities. The Georgia Division of Family and Children Services has stated that anyone with concerns about child abuse can contact their local office or call the hotline at 1-855-GA-CHILD. There is also a need for increased education surrounding child abuse, including how to identify the signs of abuse and how to support victims. Organizations such as the National Children's Alliance and Childhelp work to prevent child abuse and provide support and resources for victims and their families. As the investigation into Heaven's death continues, many are calling for justice to be served and for measures to be taken to ensure that such a tragedy does not occur again. Our hearts go out to Heaven's family and loved ones during this difficult time.
