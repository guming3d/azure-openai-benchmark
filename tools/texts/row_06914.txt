article: Beijing (CNN) -- Schoolchildren were ordered to halt outdoor sports activities until Tuesday this week, as a dirty cloud of smog continued to shroud China's capital. This was among a series of emergency response measures adopted in Beijing Sunday when the city's Air Quality Index exceeded 500 micrograms, the highest level. Anything above this is regarded as "beyond index." Reports of respiratory problems -- as well as the sale of masks -- have skyrocketed, according to state media, and over the weekend, streets appeared emptier, as a sun was barely visible amid a hazy blanket. On Monday morning the U.S. Embassy in Beijing recorded "hazardous" levels of pollution, with a "Beyond Index" reading of 515 at 3:00 a.m. (2 p.m. Sunday) local time, last seen on Saturday when the air quality index, based on U.S. national air quality standards, hit as high as 755.

Beijing Hyundai Motor Company suspended production on Sunday, and nearly 30 construction sites halted construction, the China Daily cited the city's environmental protection bureau as saying. The city's residents say pollution is worsening despite authorities' assertions that air quality has improved since the city hosted the 2008 Olympic Games. Last year, heavy haze and smog forced the cancellation of almost 700 flights at Beijing airports. The city is comparable to Los Angeles, another gray city, according to experts. "With their difficult meteorological conditions and a large number of pollution sources, addressing pollution is a long-term and difficult task," Deborah Seligsohn, adviser of the World Resources Institute, said last year. The agency runs a climate energy and pollution program in China. Los Angeles has battled air pollution since the 1950s, well before U.S. national regulation, according to Seligsohn. "Stilll in the 1970s, 20 years later, it was famous for its smog," she said. "In the 40-plus years since the Clean Air Act was passed, L.A. has never been fully in compliance with EPA standards, even though it has continued to improve."

European Commission figures show that China produced 9.7 million kilotons of carbon dioxide while the United States had 5.42 million kilotons in 2011, the latest available numbers. The weekend's pollution levels have prompted an "orange fog" warning in Beijing because of diminished visibility, according to state-run Xinhua news agency. "Pollutants have gradually accumulated over the course of recent windless days, making the air quality even worse," said Zhu Tong, an environmental sciences professor at Peking University told news agency. Beijing will remain covered in gray until Wednesday, when the wind will sweep in to the rescue and blow the smog away, according to state media.

chatgpt: Beijing, China is experiencing hazardous levels of air pollution today. The city's worst-hit areas are seeing an increase in respiratory problems and the sale of masks has skyrocketed. Officials have ordered children in these areas to stop outdoor sports activities until the air quality is deemed safe. On Sunday, the U.S. Embassy in Beijing recorded an Air Quality Index (AQI) reading of over 700 micrograms. This level of pollution is considered hazardous to anyone who breathes the air, especially those with respiratory problems. The U.S. Embassy advises American citizens to stay indoors and avoid outdoor activities in affected areas.  China has long struggled with air pollution, but the current situation is particularly severe. The National Meteorological Center of China issued its third-level warning (orange warning) on Monday morning after the visibility in the city was reduced to less than 500 meters. This is the second time in less than a month that an orange warning has been issued due to poor air quality. According to the Chinese Ministry of Ecology and Environment, the main contributors to the hazardous level of air pollution are the burning of coal and vehicle emissions. The ministry has urged local authorities to take immediate measures to reduce emissions. To combat the situation, the Beijing Municipal Government has implemented emergency measures. These measures include limiting the number of vehicles on the road, suspending construction activities, and shutting down some industrial sites. The government is also encouraging residents to reduce their use of energy by turning electricity off when not in use, using public transportation.  However, the emergency measures taken by the government are not enough to prevent the significant air pollution. Citizens of Beijing are facing a severe challenge to their health and safety, as the air quality continues to worsen. The hazardous air pollution level has also caused unrest amongst the citizens. Many have taken to social media to express their concerns and frustration with the situation. Some are calling for immediate action by the government to address the problem while others are questioning the effectiveness of the emergency measures. Beijing's air pollution problem is not new, and there have been efforts to reduce emissions and improve air quality. However, the persistence and severity of the problem continue to prove challenging. Experts suggest that long-term sustainable measures are required to tackle this pressing issue. In conclusion, Beijing is currently experiencing a hazardous level of air pollution with reports of respiratory problems increasing, and the sale of masks skyrocketing. The government has implemented emergency measures to combat the issue, but many citizens are calling for more significant and sustainable actions. The challenge of air pollution in Beijing remains complex and widespread, affecting millions of people's health and quality of life.
