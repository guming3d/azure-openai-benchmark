article: (CNN) -- Remember payphones? This might sound crazy, but if New York City has its way, people might actually start using them again to communicate with each other. The city announced Thursday that it has created Wi-Fi hotspots at 10 payphone kiosks in three of the city's boroughs. It's the first step in a pilot program designed to make wireless access available to as many people as possible in the city. The kiosks (seven in Manhattan, two in Brooklyn and one in Queens) have antennas that create Wi-Fi hotspots providing free wireless service up to 300 feet away. More will be added in the coming months, according to the blog post announcing the program. In an era when it seems like everyone has a phone, smart or dumb, in their pocket, payphones may seem like just another technological dinosaur that the mobile age has relegated to the digital trash heap alongside pagers, beepers and busy signals. But they're not gone entirely. There are somewhere in the neighborhood of 12,000 payphone kiosks in New York, a city of roughly 8.2 million people. The announcement was receiving high marks from tech bloggers Friday. "I think it's a good start for reusing payphones, which serve less and less need in our mobile-centric world," Ryan Kim wrote for tech blog GigaOm. "And it speaks to our addiction to Wi-Fi and data, which is now even more popular than cellular." Kim noted that more public Wi-Fi could lessen congestion on busy cellular networks in big, tech-savvy cities like New York and San Francisco, where chasing down those elusive 3G (or 4G) bars can be a frustrating experience. "I can't recall the last time I've used a payphone but I'll be glad to see them around if it means more free Wi-Fi," he wrote. Expanding Wi-Fi service in New York has been a priority for Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The city has partnered with AT&T on a five-year project to provide free Wi-Fi at 26 locations in 20 parks throughout the city.

chatgpt: New York City, known for its advanced technology usage, has taken another step towards modernization by transforming ten payphone kiosks into Wi-Fi hotspots. The move comes as part of a new initiative to provide free internet access to New Yorkers on the go. According to sources, the Wi-Fi hotspots are expected to benefit thousands of New Yorkers who rely on payphones to communicate with the outside world. Payphones haven't been in demand lately due to the advent of smartphones and other advanced communication devices. The initiative is a joint effort between the city of New York and AT&T, an American telecommunications company. Both entities have been working collaboratively to bring free Wi-Fi to 20 more parks throughout the city. The initiative has received overwhelming support from residents who say that it will improve their quality of life and enable them to stay connected with the outside world. As part of the initiative, the New York City Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DoITT), along with AT&T, has tested Wi-Fi access points throughout the city. Two payphones in Manhattan, three in Queens, two in Brooklyn, and three in the Bronx have been transformed into Wi-Fi hotspots. As stated by a spokesperson from DoITT, more locations are expected to be added over the coming months. The city is also planning to integrate new features to enhance the user experience, such as charging stations and touchscreen connectivity with local businesses. The move to bring free Wi-Fi to New York City's parks is also part of a broader push towards expanding internet access in the city. With more people working from home due to the ongoing pandemic, access to reliable internet has become more critical than ever. The city is also looking to address the digital divide that exists in many neighborhoods and communities throughout the city. The initiative is aimed at providing these areas with high-speed internet access, thereby reducing the gap between rich and poor. In conclusion, the initiative to bring free Wi-Fi to New York City's payphones and parks is a significant step towards modernization and technological advancement. It is expected to improve the quality of life of New Yorkers, enhance their connectivity with the world, and address the digital divide that exists in many communities.
