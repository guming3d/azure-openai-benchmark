article: Archaeologists have unearthed hundreds of Roman graves in southwest France, some of which contain skeletons still bound by shackles on their necks and ankles. The incredible excavation is located at a building site about 250m west of the Saintes amphitheatre once used for battles between gladiators and wild animals. Among the hundreds of graves found, five skeletons - four  adults and one child - were found shackled or chained. A skeleton uncovered at the Roman burial site pictured exactly as the individual was buried - with an iron shackle attached to his neck . A wider photo shows the same skeleton - thought to be a man - with a shackle on his ankle as well as his neck . This group of four people were buried head-to-toe in a small, trench-style grave . Dating back to the first and second centuries AD, the grave site is thought to have been an important necropolis used for those massacred at the nearby stadium. Three skeletons were found with iron chains attached to their legs, another was buried in a crude shackle around his neck and a child was found with a device on its wrist. Several of the graves were found to be mass burials - pictures show individuals buried side-by-side, head to toe in trench-style graves. The site was first identified as a possible necropolis last year and scientists are now hoping they can establish the individuals' cause of death. Roman necropoleis were usually constructed in the country as a site for burials and cremations to take place away from tombs built within a city. In this photo, another skeleton can be seen buried with a shackle still attached to its ankle . Unfortunately, the graves at Saintes have yielded almost no artefacts or possessions. Only a few vases were found with the remains of one man, and a child was found with coins resting on his eyes. Roman custom was to place coins on the eyes of the deceased so the person's spirit could pay the ferryman to take them across the river Romans believed divided the world of the living and that of the dead. The period of Roman rule across what is now France is commonly referred to as Gallo-Roman, and the graves discovered in Saintes this week fall within this category. The period in which the graves were used - the first and second centuries AD - corresponds to a time in history when Saintes' was a thriving Roman town. It was established as a regional capital during this period because of its location where the major road between Lyon and Acquitaine met with the Charente River. It is famed for its Roman Colosseum-style arena, which when completed, held up to 18,000 people. Construction on the area started during the reign of Tiberius (14 - 37AD) and finished under Claudius (41 - 54AD). It is the largest and oldest remaining Roman amphitheatre in France.

chatgpt: Archaeologists have made a startling discovery at an ancient Roman site, unearthing what appears to be a mass grave. The site, which dates back to the first or second century AD, has yielded hundreds of graves, many of which contain the remains of individuals buried with iron shackles on their necks and ankles. The discovery has raised many questions about why these individuals may have been restrained in such a manner. One theory suggests that the site may have been used to dispose of the dead from nearby arenas, where gladiatorial battles were fought. It is possible that the individuals buried at the site were prisoners or slaves who were forced to fight to the death in the arenas. Despite this theory, researchers caution that further investigation is needed to fully understand the significance of the graves. It is unclear if the individuals buried with shackles on their necks and ankles were indeed gladiators or if there were other reasons for why they were restrained in such a manner. One thing is certain, however – the site provides a unique glimpse into the daily life of ancient Romans. The discovery of hundreds of graves at a single site suggests that this may have been a cemetery used by the local community. The individuals buried at the site may have been people of all walks of life – from wealthy citizens to slaves. Scientists plan to study the remains further in order to gain a better understanding of how and why the individuals buried at the site died. Analyses of the bones and teeth may provide clues about the individual's health and diet, while DNA analysis may reveal more about their ancestry and relationships. The discovery of this mass grave is just one of many exciting finds at the ancient Roman site. The area was once home to a bustling city, and researchers have previously uncovered evidence of Roman baths, temples, and public buildings. The latest excavation has provided new insights into the daily life of the people who lived and died in this ancient city. As archaeologists continue to study the site, they hope to gain a more complete picture of what life was like in ancient Rome. The discoveries made at this site could help shed light on the complex social structures and cultural practices of this fascinating civilization. Despite the long passage of time since the individuals were buried at the site, their stories are still waiting to be told. Through meticulous research and analysis, scientists hope to unravel the mysteries of this ancient cemetery and gain new insights into the lives of the people who once called this place home.
