article: Apple has been accused of kowtowing to the Chinese government by pulling from its China App Store a product enabling users to circumvent firewalls and access restricted sites. OpenDoor, a free app that provides users a randomized IP address to keep their browsing habits anonymous and shielded from censors, was removed after the tech giant deemed it contained "illegal content," the app's lead developer told CNN. It remains available in App Stores outside China. The developer -- who wished to remain anonymous, saying that "as the developers of an app that protects users' privacy and anonymity online, it only makes sense to do the same ourselves" -- said Apple provided no notification that the app had been pulled, with the developers only learning from consumers. When Apple responded to OpenDoor, they were told only that the app contained content that was illegal in China. Apple requires developers to comply with legal requirements in all locations in which the product is made available. The company did not respond to CNN's request for comment. OpenDoor, a self-described "small team of programmers spread across the world collaborating over the Internet," considers it has reasonable grounds to challenge Apple's move, as its product is a browser app and any content accessed through it is at the discretion of the user. But the developer said there were no plans to try to force the tech giant into a rethink. "Unfortunately, we're not aware of any app developer ever (successful) in challenging Apple's decision. In fact, we won't be surprised if Apple decides to pull our app from all app stores and/or terminates our account in retaliation (to publicity over the issue)." The developer said that prior to its removal from Apple's China App Store on July 11, the app was being downloaded about 2,000 times a day in China, accounting for about a third of the app's total downloads. The Chinese government strictly polices Internet access, censoring web users and blocking access to sites deemed sensitive. Chinese social media users were critical of Apple's move, saying the decision diminished the company's moral standing, and comparing it unfavorably to Google as a champion of Internet freedom. "The fruit is contaminated," wrote a user on the Twitter-like Sina Weibo microblog under the handle @XieGov. "Where's your integrity!" asked @Shenzhenlangya. "The only one who doesn't surrender to evil is my great Google!" wrote @Meihoujiushilaowang. A smaller group were more understanding of the company's position, however, acknowledging that conforming to China's censorship policy was the price to pay to do business in the country. "Apple is determined to do well in China," wrote Sina Weibo user @Mantianyufeihong. "How can Apple step in to the Chinese market without strict censorship? How can it do business without showing their sincerity (to the government)?" Other apps previously removed from Apple's App Store in China for falling foul of censorship laws include one providing access to forbidden books, and a news app for a U.S.-based broadcaster founded by the banned spiritual group Falun Gong.

chatgpt: Apple Under Fire for Blocking China Access to OpenDoor App
 
The tech giant Apple is facing criticism from users of social media in China after it blocked access to the app, OpenDoor. The app is designed to bypass censorship, but was pulled down after being found to violate local laws. Critics say the move has damaged Apple's reputation for upholding freedom of speech. The OpenDoor App was created by an independent developer and has been in use in China since 2017. According to reports, it was one of the few tools available to Chinese users seeking to access outside information despite government censorship . The app works by routing data through VPN (virtual private networks), which allow users to bypass China's "Great Firewall" and access information that has been blocked by the government. However, the app's days were numbered after it fell foul of China's strict censorship laws. The authorities claimed that OpenDoor contravened regulations prohibiting the use of VPNs without the approval of the government. As a result, on November 1, 2019, Apple removed the app from its App Store in China. The move has caused consternation among users of Chinese social media, which is something of a free speech battleground. Many are accusing Apple of hypocrisy and of putting profits before principle. They claim that the tech giant is violating its own values by kowtowing to the Chinese authorities in order to maintain its business interests. One user wrote: "Apple says they protect their users' privacy and data security. Now they have bowed to the Chinese government and helped it control the internet. What happened to their integrity?" Another argued that using the app demonstrated a commitment to the values of "human rights, freedom and democracy," and that "Apple has forgotten them for the sake of the market." Criticism of the move has not been limited to social media, either. It has also sparked debate in China's academic circles, where many are calling for greater freedoms of expression. In a statement, Apple said it had no choice but to remove the app from its App Store in China after being informed by local authorities that it breached the country's cyber regulations. The company stressed that it is committed to safeguarding user rights and privacy and operates in compliance with local laws. It also pointed out that it had removed other VPN apps from its store in China when ordered to do so. Some analysts say that Apple's position is understandable given the importance of the Chinese market to its business. The company generates a significant proportion of its revenue from the region and has invested heavily in establishing relationships with both Chinese manufacturers and the authorities. However, critics argue that by pandering to the demands of a country that has a notorious track record for suppressing free speech, Apple is undermining its own values and credibility. The controversy highlights the trade-offs that global businesses are forced to make when operating in territories with conflicting laws and values. In particular, it raises difficult questions about the role of technology companies in promoting free expression and preserving the privacy rights of users. As tech firms increasingly play a pivotal role in shaping global social and economic structures, critics say they need to take a more principled stand when it comes to issues of censorship and human rights.  In conclusion, the OpenDoor App is the latest case in point involving private companies and state-level censorship. It has served to highlight once again the complex relationship between the values of global tech firms and the political and societal context in which they operate. How Apple responds to the criticism it has received in China may well set the tone for its future approach to balancing free expression and business interests.
