article: At first glance, it looks like a perfectly normal helicopter. But Northrop Grumman’s new MQ-8C Fire Scout is missing one key thing - a pilot. The craft, shown off at a trade show this week, has been stuffed with electronics so it can be flown as a drone - but with all the same capabilities as a normal helicopter. Mockup of an MQ-8C Fire Scout from the Northrup Grumman display at the Sea-Air-Space Expo 2013 . The MQ-8C Fire Scout looks almost identical to a normal helicopter - but is in fact a drone . The ultimate drone in numbers . The MQ-8C Fire Scout is a fully autonomous, fourblade, single-engine unmanned helicopter.

'The craft combines the best of two proven air systems in a low-cost, fast-fielding package,' said the defence firm. Earlier this year the US Navy awarded Northrop Grumman a $71 million contract to procure six additional MQ-8C Fire-X variants, for a total of 30 aircraft. George Vardoulakis, vice president for tactical unmanned systems with Northrop Grumman's Aerospace Systems sector said, 'this contract provides significant momentum for the work Northrop Grumman and its supply chain partners are doing to meet the Navy's requirements.'

chatgpt: The US Military has added another weapon to its arsenal as it plans to employ the MQ-8C Fire Scout as a surveillance drone. This advanced drone has the same capabilities and range as the Bell 407 Helicopter and is expected to revolutionize the military's unmanned air vehicles. The MQ-8C Fire Scout is a small, autonomous helicopter that has the ability to detect, track, and engage multiple targets from the sky. This makes it an ideal tool for reconnaissance and surveillance missions, both of which are critical to securing the nation's airspace. The drone is capable of flying over 15 hours uninterrupted, providing critical surveillance data to military commanders on the ground. The Fire Scout has a number of unique features that make it an ideal choice for military missions. Perhaps the most important is its ability to operate from both land and sea, making it a versatile tool in a variety of different environments. Additionally, the drone's advanced communications equipment enables it to transmit real-time data to military commanders, ensuring that they have the most up-to-date information at their fingertips. The MQ-8C Fire Scout is also equipped with state-of-the-art sensors and imaging technology. These tools allow the drone to capture high-resolution images of the target area, providing valuable information about enemy movements and activities. This information can then be used to plan and execute military operations with greater accuracy and efficiency. According to military officials, the MQ-8C Fire Scout represents a major milestone in the development of unmanned aircraft. "This vehicle is a game changer," said one military expert. "It provides us with capabilities that we simply didn't have before. It's going to revolutionize the way we conduct military operations." The Fire Scout is just one of many advanced technologies being developed by the US military to ensure that it remains a global superpower. With its advanced capabilities and range, the Fire Scout is expected to be a major asset in the years to come, helping to keep America's enemies at bay and ensuring the safety of its citizens both at home and abroad.
