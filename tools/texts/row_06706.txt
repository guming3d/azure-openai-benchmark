chatgpt: Manchester United's Angel di Maria and Daley Blind have both been speaking highly of the warm welcome they have received from the local fans since joining the club. Di Maria arrived at United in 2014 for a club-record fee of £60million from Real Madrid, while Blind joined the team in the summer of 2014 from boyhood club Ajax. Since their arrival in the city, both players have been struck by the friendliness of Manchester United's supporters. The Argentinian winger, di Maria, said that he had been impressed by the passion and enthusiasm of the fans, who have been quick to show their support for the team. Blind, a Dutch international, similarly praised the supporters, commenting on their loyalty and their ability to create a great atmosphere at matches. The duo will now be hoping that the fans can help them clinch a victory over local rivals Manchester City, as United prepare to travel to the Etihad Stadium for the highly-anticipated Manchester derby this weekend. The match is always one of the most fiercely-contested fixtures of the Premier League season, and there is sure to be plenty of excitement surrounding the clash. Manchester United will be looking to build on their impressive form so far this season, which has seen them climb to the top of the Premier League table. The Red Devils have made an excellent start to the campaign, winning six of their opening seven matches, and they will be hoping to extend that run against their neighbours. However, Manchester City will be no pushovers, and United will need to be on top form if they are to come away with a positive result. The Citizens have also enjoyed a strong start to the season, and they will be able to call upon the likes of Raheem Sterling, Kevin De Bruyne, and Gabriel Jesus, who will all be looking to cause problems for the United defence. Despite the threat posed by City, Manchester United will be feeling confident heading into the game, with the likes of di Maria and Blind both in fine form. The two players have settled well into life in Manchester and have already made significant contributions to the team's success this season. The Manchester derby promises to be a thrilling encounter, and one that is sure to be watched by millions of football fans around the world.
