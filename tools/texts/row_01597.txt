It's the dream of anyone who has ever watched TV’s Cash In The Attic: that something among the ‘junk’ in their loft might actually be worth a small fortune. But when teacher Jane Cordery tackled her cluttered roof space, her main aim was to clear some space around pipes for a plumber. Then she stumbled across a battered old painting of an owl – covered in dust and cobwebs – and  the dream came true for her. As an art teacher in a prep school, with an eye for a well-painted picture, she found herself drawn to its intricate brushwork. Intrigued, she emailed a photograph to Christie’s, whose expert, Brandon Lindberg, immediately spotted its potential. It turned out to be by eminent pre-Raphaelite artist William James Webbe and has been valued at about £70,000 by experts at the auction house. ‘It’s a complete shock – I’ve never won anything beyond the odd thing from a tombola,’ said Ms Cordery. It has since been discovered that the painting, which measures 18in by 10in, was exhibited at the Royal Society in 1856, and praised by the leading art critic of the time, John Ruskin, who wrote that it was ‘a careful study, the brown wing excellent’. Ms Cordery, 66, was sure she had never seen the painting before she set to work in the attic of her Edwardian semi in Basingstoke, Hampshire. But her partner James Ravenscroft, 69, recalled being given it by his mother ten years ago among other ‘bits and bobs’. The White Owl will be auctioned by Christie’s on December 13.

Jane Cordery, a homeowner from Dorking, came across a painting by chance when she cleared out her roof space to create storage space. Little did she know that what she had discovered was a rare masterpiece painted by an unknown artist.
