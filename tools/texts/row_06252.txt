Unfortunately, the Croatian defender missed his spot-kick, as the Turkish giants won 5-4 on penalties, sending the Reds crashing out of the competition. Speaking to reporters after the match, Rodgers said Lovren had asked to take a penalty, adding that he was "disappointed" the defender missed the crucial spot-kick. "He showed great bravery to take it," the Liverpool boss said. "But unfortunately, he missed it." The match had been closely contested throughout, with neither side able to find the back of the net in regulation time. With the score tied 1-1 on aggregate after extra time, the match went to penalties. Liverpool held the advantage early on as Besiktas missed their second penalty, but Lovren's miss proved to be decisive. The Reds had another chance to stay in the game, but their last shot was saved by Besiktas goalkeeper Cenk Gonen. The defeat will come as a huge disappointment to Liverpool, who had high hopes of reaching the quarter-finals of the Europa League this season. The Reds had been in sparkling form in the competition before the Besiktas defeat, having won five of their six previous matches. Despite the disappointment, Rodgers was keen to praise his players for their efforts. "I think the players gave everything they had out there," he said. "It's always difficult to lose on penalties, but I think we can hold our heads up high." Liverpool will now turn their attention back to the Premier League, as they bid to secure a top-four finish and qualification for next season's Champions League.
