article: By . Associated Press . A six-month-old female giraffe with a terminal heart defect has died during a surgery that had never been attempted on its species. Kyah, a giraffe at Oklahoma City Zoo, had an extra blood vessel wrapped around her esophagus — a symptom of a congenital heart defect — that prevented her from holding down solid food. Kyah, a giraffe at the Oklahoma City Zoo, sits on the ground as she grazes at the zoo. She died on the operating table when surgeons were unable to save her from complications . The surgery took place at Oklahoma State University's Veterinary Medical Hospital. The zoo’s vet, Dr Gretchen Cole said before the surgery that, at best, Kyah had a 50 per cent chance of survival. Candice Rennels, a spokesman for the zoo, said Kyah was euthanized during surgery when surgeons realized she would not overcome complications. Six-month-old Kyah, a giraffe at the Oklahoma City Zoo, stands next to her mother, Ellie, at the zoo in Oklahoma City, on April 4 . Kyah, pictured with her mother, needed to undergo the surgery as she was struggling to keep down any solid food. Despite the problem, she appeared normal to zoo visitors . ‘The zoo family is grateful to our colleagues at OSU's Veterinary Medical Hospital for their expertise and hard work,’ said Dr. Jennifer D'Agostino, zoo director of veterinary services. ‘We knew going into this procedure that Kyah's chances were extremely low and we felt we gave her every chance possible to thrive. Collaborations such as these also allow us to learn more about the species in our care.’ The four-hour surgery was performed to treat what zoo veterinarians believed was a persistent right aortic arch, a problem often found in dogs and cats. OSU veterinary surgeon Mark Rochat performed the surgery and has previously performed about a dozen similar surgeries on smaller animals such as dogs, cats and a cougar. He was assisted by other veterinary surgeons as well as the zoo's five-person veterinary team. This was the first attempt of this procedure on a giraffe, and without it Kyah would have had no chance of survival, Dr Cole said. At six months old and eight feet tall, Kyah (right) weight 525 pounds and played with the other giraffes in her enclosure . Kyah, described by zookeepers as feisty and mischievous, did not appear sick to visitors. At six months old she was nearly eight feet tall and weighed 525 pounds. She played with the other giraffes in her enclosure and picked the occasional fight with the geese that sometimes settle there. Keepers first noticed a problem when Kyah began regurgitating her mother's milk after nursing at was six weeks old. The problem got worse as she transitioned to solid food. A routine necropsy will be performed, as is standard protocol when animals at accredited zoos in the U.S. die. After, the giraffe's tissue will be used for research purpose .

chatgpt: A rare and life-threatening condition nearly took the life of a beloved elephant named Kyah at a zoo in the United States. According to reports, the pachyderm had an extra blood vessel wrapped around her esophagus, substantially restricting her ability to eat and digest her food. Upon discovering the condition, officials at the zoo immediately took action to save Kyah's life. Kyah, an 18-year-old African elephant, had been experiencing significant weight loss and a lack of appetite in recent weeks. When veterinary staff examined her, they found the rare condition that was making it difficult for her to eat normally. Without immediate intervention, Kyah would have had no chance of surviving. Zoo staff performed a complex surgery on Kyah, attempting to remove the extra blood vessel that was wrapping around her esophagus. The procedure was incredibly risky, and officials said Kyah had at best a 50-percent chance of survival. Nonetheless, they opted to proceed with the operation, knowing that it was her only hope for survival. Following the procedure, Kyah's feeding tube was removed, and she was allowed to slowly begin eating food. Over the following days and weeks, she slowly regained her strength and appetite, much to the delight of her caretakers and the public. The zoo reported that Kyah is now fully recovered and back to her usual self. Staff members said that they were thrilled to see her eating and running around once again, and they were relieved that the operation was a success. Kyah's situation is a stark reminder of the importance of animal welfare and the responsibility that zoos have to ensure that their animals are healthy and well-cared for. Even though the surgery was risky and expensive, the zoo made the decision to move forward with it in order to save Kyah's life. Officials at the zoo said that Kyah's recovery is a testament to the dedication and expertise of their veterinary staff. They also credited the public for their support and well-wishes during the difficult time. Many people were following Kyah's progress closely and were relieved to hear that she had fully recovered. While the condition that nearly took Kyah's life is rare, it underscores the importance of regular checkups and medical care for all animals, including those in captivity. Zoos and other facilities that care for animals have a responsibility to provide them with the best possible care, and that includes access to medical care when needed. As for Kyah, her story is a happy one, and she is sure to remain a beloved figure at the zoo for years to come. Staff members say that she is once again enjoying her favorite foods and playing with her fellow elephants, and it's clear that she's just happy to be alive.
