Anessa Dawn Olive Ferguson, 32, was taken into custody on Tuesday at her home in the city of Dothan. According to court documents, Ferguson is accused of engaging in sexual activity with the underage boy over the course of several months. The boy was reported to be a family friend and was allegedly subjected to "forcible compulsion" by the defendant. The indictment alleges that Ferguson used her position of authority and influence over the boy to coerce him into sexual activity. The charges carry a potential sentence of up to 20 years in prison and a maximum fine of $30,000. Ferguson was held in the Houston County Jail on a $60,000 bond.
