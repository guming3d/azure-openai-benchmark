'We found that athletes were . generally able to inhibit behavior, to stop quickly when they had to, . which is very important in sport and in daily life,' Kramer said. 'They were also able to activate, to . pick up information from a glance and to switch between tasks more . quickly than nonathletes. 'I would say these were modest differences, but they were interesting differences nonetheless.' Overall, the athletes were faster at memory tests and tasks that required them to switch between tasks. They were quicker to notice things in their peripheral vision and to detect subtle changes in a scene. And in general, they were better able to accomplish tasks while ignoring confusing or irrelevant information. The team also found that being an athlete minimizes the performance differences that normally occur between women and men.

Female athletes, the researchers . found, were more like their male peers in the speed of their mental . calculations and reaction times, while nonathletic females performed the . same tasks more slowly than their male counterparts. The study appears in the journal Frontiers in Psychology, and the researchers say they are still unsure if the skills or learnt, or athletes were born with them. 'Our understanding is imperfect because . we don't know whether these abilities in the athletes were 'born' or . 'made,' " he said.

chatgpt: According to a recent study, Brazilian volleyball players who have competed in the Beijing and London Olympics have proven not only to be physically exceptional but also mentally sharp. A team of experts examined 87 of the top-ranked Brazilian volleyball players and found that they excelled in how fast their brains could take in and respond to new information.  The study, led by professor Roberta Ricci and her team from the University of Sao Paulo, used special tests to measure the cognitive abilities of these athletes. The results showed that these players have superior perceptual-cognitive skills, which allow them to make quick decisions on the court. "These skills are critical for athletes playing fast-paced sports like volleyball, where quick and accurate decision-making can make all the difference," said Ricci, the lead author of the study. The study also found that these players have a better ability to focus their attention and quickly shift their concentration when needed. Such skills are indispensable in high-pressure situations, where athletes must be able to execute their plays flawlessly, regardless of distractions or changes to the game's circumstances. The performance of these Brazilian volleyball players in the Olympics has been extraordinary, with the team winning medals in both Beijing and London. These players have exhibited exceptional athleticism, speed, strength, and agility. However, the study's findings suggest that the success of these players may also be attributed to their mental strength. "Volleyball is a very dynamic sport that requires quick reactions and decision-making. Therefore, the cognitive abilities of these athletes play a vital role," added Ricci. This study's results hold great promise for the future of Brazilian volleyball, as coaches can use this information to tailor their training programs to further develop their players' cognitive abilities. This could lead to even better performances and more victories in the future. The study highlights the importance of cognitive training in sports and reveals the intricate relationship between cognitive abilities and athletic performance. The findings demonstrate how the ability to process information quickly and accurately can make a significant difference in competitive sports. Overall, the study suggests that Brazilian volleyball players are among the world's best not only in their physical abilities but also in their cognitive abilities. Their success on the court can be attributed to their heightened perceptual-cognitive skills, which set them apart from their competitors. The future looks bright for Brazilian volleyball with these findings offering new insights into developing world-class athletes.
