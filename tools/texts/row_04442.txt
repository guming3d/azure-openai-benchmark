article: (CNN) -- At least 24 people were killed early Sunday when militants raided a Sunni town in northern Yemen, medics and witnesses said. The Houthi Shia militants raided a Sunni town in Sa'ada in the predawn hours, medics said. At least 61 Sunnis are also injured when their homes were shelled with grenades, the medics said. They medics did not want to be named because they are not authorized to talk to the media. Witnesses said the injured did not get medical attention because the town was under siege. The Houthi attacks were concentrated on a Sunni religious center, according to witnesses. All mediation efforts to end the conflict have failed. Houthis, a pro-Shia movement in Yemen, has expanded during the 10-month struggle to oust the president. Opposition officials have expressed concern over its growth. "We cannot indulge in any political agreement with an armed movement. How can we involve them into politics when they don't believe in it," said Ali Mamari, an opposition member in Yemen. Mamari said Yemenis will not accept movements that spread with force and kill people. "There is no difference between Houthis and al Qaeda, both are armed and use force to spread their beliefs," he said. Houthis rejected the power transfer signing that took place in Riyadh earlier this week and said it would not recognize it. "The movement has more than 100,000 fighters ready to obey commands from their spiritual leader, Abdul Malik al-Houthi," said Ahmed Bahri, an expert in Houthi affairs. "This movement is well organized and only has one head," Bahri said. "They now control majority areas in the provinces in Sa'ada and Jawf, and have powerful presence in Amran, Mareb, Sana'a and Hajjah," added Bahri. Sectarian violence is at peak in northern Yemen where Houthis control is spread across five provinces. Saudi Arabia fought the Houthis in 2009 but failed to end their expansion. The attacks come a day after Yemen's vice president called for presidential elections to be held in February, state media reported. President Ali Abdullah Saleh stepped down after months of protests against his 33-year rule. He became the fourth leader to leave office as a result of the Arab Spring unrest that has roiled much of the Middle East and North Africa this year. Saleh returned to Yemen on Saturday night, days after he signed an agreement in Saudi Arabia yielding his powers, according to the Yemen official news agency .

chatgpt: Dozens were killed and at least 61 people were injured when militants raided a Sunni town, shelling homes with grenades. The town, which is under siege, has been cut off from the outside world, making it difficult for doctors to reach the injured. The attack occurred in the early hours of the morning and was carried out by a group of militants. They targeted homes in the Sunni town, throwing grenades and firing weapons. As a result, dozens were killed, and many others were injured. According to local reports, the town has been under siege for the past several weeks, and the attack has only made the situation worse. The attackers have cut off all communication lines, making it impossible for people to call for help or contact loved ones outside the town. Doctors and medical aid workers have been unable to enter the town to treat the injured due to the ongoing siege. The wounded have been left to suffer without proper medical attention, causing widespread outrage and condemnation. In the aftermath of the attack, Saleh, the former president of Yemen, returned to the country on Saturday night. Saleh has been living in exile in Saudi Arabia since 2012 when he was forced to resign after months of protests against his rule. Saleh's return has sparked speculation about his intentions and what role he may play in the ongoing conflict in Yemen. Some experts believe that Saleh's return could complicate the situation even further, adding another layer of complexity to an already complex conflict. Meanwhile, the attack on the Sunni town has once again highlighted the brutality of the ongoing conflict in Yemen, which has claimed the lives of thousands of people and displaced millions. The UN has called for an end to the violence and urged all sides to come to the negotiating table to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict. The attack on the Sunni town underscores the need for immediate action to protect civilians and put an end to the ongoing violence in Yemen. The international community must work together to find a solution to the conflict and bring an end to the suffering of the Yemeni people.
