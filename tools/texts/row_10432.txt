chatgpt: Lobster has long been considered a luxury food item, but it seems that the UK's appetite for this delicacy is at an all-time high. This is due to the availability of lobster and the fact that it is now being sold at a lower price than ever before. Lobster sales have soared in recent years, as the delicacy is no longer just reserved for high-end restaurants. High Street takeaways and snack bars are now serving lobster, while lobster shacks are popping up across the country. Customers can now enjoy a delicious lobster roll for as little as £9, making it more accessible to the general public. Analysts are predicting that the price of lobster could fall even further this year, making it even more affordable for consumers. This is due to an increase in the supply of lobster, coupled with a decrease in demand from China, which has traditionally been a large consumer of the seafood. However, while this may be good news for consumers, it is causing concern for those in the industry, particularly those who are reliant on the high prices of lobster to make a profit. Lobster fishermen in particular are feeling the strain, as the low prices are making it difficult for them to make ends meet. Despite this, the popularity of lobster in the UK shows no signs of slowing down. In fact, many are predicting that it could overtake other popular seafood items such as prawns and crab in the near future. One reason for this is the increasing awareness of the health benefits of lobster. It is high in protein, low in fat, and an excellent source of vitamins and minerals. In fact, some studies have even shown that it can help to reduce the risk of heart disease and other health conditions. Overall, while the availability and low price of lobster may be causing concern for those in the industry, it is clear that the UK's love affair with this delicacy shows no signs of abating. Whether it's served in a high-end restaurant or a humble takeaway, lobster is a food item that is here to stay.
