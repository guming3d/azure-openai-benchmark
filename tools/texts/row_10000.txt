His records show that he was disciplined for making an 'unwelcome comment' to an employee and hitting a car, but has never been flagged up for dancing. 'It's all about enjoying what you do and that's the way I feel,' he said. 'Clean fun. It's nothing like doing any bumping and grinding. People just have nothing else to do but bash people. No twerks, no jerking, no nothing.' He added that he dances in front of people to bring a smile to their face. Deeanna Demian, a park patron, said: 'Sad. I mean somebody's trying to have fun and entertain people and they get fired for doing that. I don't understand.'

chatgpt: A security guard in Chattanooga, Tennessee, has been arrested for "unbecoming conduct" and neglecting his duties. Deryl Nelson, aged 51, was taken into custody after a visitor to Coolidge Park complained about his behaviour. Nelson was accused of engaging in inappropriate conduct while on duty. His actions were described as unprofessional and not in keeping with his job responsibilities. Officials at the park launched an investigation into the incident after the visitor's complaint was filed. During the investigation, Nelson tried to defend his actions, saying that he was not doing anything wrong. He claimed that his conduct was not as bad as some people were making it out to be. "It's nothing like doing any bumping and grinding," he said when asked about his behavior. Despite Nelson's insistence that he had done nothing wrong, officials at the park decided to take action against him. They accused him of neglecting his duties and engaging in conduct that was unbecoming of a security guard. Nelson was subsequently arrested and charged with disorderly conduct. He was taken to the police station and questioned about the incident. He will now be required to appear in court to answer the charges against him. The incident has raised concerns about security measures at the park. Some visitors have expressed their worries that there may be other security guards who are not doing their jobs properly. "I'm glad they caught this guy, but I'm worried about what else might be going on out there," said one visitor to Coolidge Park. The investigation into the incident is ongoing, and officials say that they will take action against any other security guards who are found to be engaging in similar behaviour. In the meantime, Nelson has been suspended from his job as a security guard at the park pending the outcome of his court case. The incident at Coolidge Park serves as a reminder of the importance of professional conduct in the workplace. Security guards, like all employees, are expected to maintain a high standard of behaviour at all times in order to create a safe and welcoming environment for visitors.
