article: (CNN) -- Authorities investigating the disappearance of a 10-year-old North Carolina girl have recovered "evidence that could provide valuable information" in the case, police said Thursday. The evidence was located Wednesday, Hickory, North Carolina, police said in a statement, and will be analyzed at the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation's lab. Police launched a search for Zahra Baker October 9, but said no one other than a family member has reported seeing her since September 25, when a woman saw her at a furniture store. Police did not elaborate or say what the evidence is. "We understand the concern and interest in this case by the public, but we must be cautious in prematurely releasing information, so it will not jeopardize any future criminal proceedings," police said. Authorities said earlier this month a bone that might be related to the case was found. They also previously found a prosthetic leg belonging to Zahra, whose disappearance is being investigated as a homicide. Elisa Baker, Zahra's stepmother, is jailed on charges unrelated to the girl's disappearance, as well as an obstruction of justice charge related to the case after she admitted to writing a fake ransom note found at the family's home. Elisa Baker has said said she did not know what happened to Zahra, a freckle-faced girl who lost her leg to bone cancer at age 5 and reportedly developed lung cancer a few years later. Zahra's father, Adam Baker, was arrested late last month in nearby Catawba County on eight charges, including five counts of submitting worthless checks and three counts of failing to appear in court. Police earlier acknowledged that Adam Baker faced bad-check charges unrelated to the disappearance of his daughter. But they did not initially arrest him, as he had been helping authorities in their search. Zahra's biological mother, Emily Dietrich, is coming to North Carolina from Australia, CNN affiliate WSOC reported. She could arrive sometime Thursday. Last week, Dietrich told Australia's Seven Network that she had little hope of seeing Zahra alive again, according to WSOC. Dietrich has not had contact with her daughter since Zahra was an infant. Meanwhile, the Children's Protection Council of Catawba County said it will hold a candlelight vigil in honor of Zahra on Tuesday, her birthday. Toys or stuffed animals left at the vigil will be donated to the Cops for Tots organization, the group said in a statement.

chatgpt: The biological mother of Zahra Baker is set to arrive in the United States from Australia to attend a vigil scheduled on her daughter's birthday next week. Zahra, a 10-year-old girl, went missing in 2010, and the investigation into her disappearance is now being treated as a homicide. Zahra's stepmother, Elisa Baker, has already been charged with obstruction of justice in connection with the case. While the investigation is still ongoing, investigators believe that Elisa had something to do with Zahra's disappearance. Since Zahra's disappearance, her biological mother, Emily Dietrich, has been advocating for justice for her daughter. Dietrich has been based in Australia, but she has been following the developments in her daughter's case closely. Now, she is set to travel to America to join Zahra's friends and supporters at the vigil. Dietrich has expressed her appreciation for the ongoing support that she has received from people who have followed the case since her daughter went missing. She shared that she wants to keep her daughter's memory alive and for the people to know that she was not forgotten. Zahra's case was a high-profile one that drew attention from all over the world. The girl had survived cancer and had lost parts of her leg and hearing because of it. She had been living with Elisa and her father, Adam Baker, in North Carolina when she went missing. During the investigation, it was discovered that Elisa had a troubled past and a history of making false claims. As the investigation progressed, Elisa's lies began to unravel and the authorities grew suspicious of her involvement in Zahra's disappearance. While the vigil on Zahra's birthday would be a solemn event, it would also serve as a reminder that justice has yet to be served. The event aims to keep Zahra's memory alive while shedding light on the importance of accountability in cases of child abuse and neglect. The community's support for the event shows that Zahra's story touched the lives of many, and her memory and legacy will continue to inspire and urge for greater responsibility and justice. In conclusion, the case of Zahra Baker, a young girl whose disappearance is being investigated as a homicide, continues to touch people's lives. With her mother's arrival from Australia and a vigil planned on her birthday, the community hopes to keep Zahra's memory alive and to push for justice in her case.
