article: (CNN) -- Want to combine your frequent flier points with friends and family to earn free flights faster? JetBlue Airways will now allow members of its TrueBlue loyalty program to register as a family to share loyalty points within a designated group. "It's a GREAT way for family and friends to combine points so they can earn a free ticket a lot easier and quicker," aviation blogger Johnny "Jet" DiScala wrote in an e-mail. "I wish the other airlines would do the same." Adult TrueBlue members can sign up for family pooling, including one other grownup and up to five children who are also members. Each family member can decide what percentage of their points to contribute to the family account. From there, the chosen "head of household" can monitor the family's account and redeem points at JetBlue. Members can join only one JetBlue "family." JetBlue executives may be trying to strengthen a loyalty program that doesn't have as many airline partner options as traditional carriers. JetBlue lists American Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, Aer Lingus and Emirates among its loyalty partners. In contrast, United Airlines lists 28 worldwide Star Alliance airline partners in its MileagePlus program. Delta Air Lines SkyMiles Award Travel program lists 26 worldwide partner airlines. TrueBlue allows members to use points for any seat on any JetBlue operated flight with no blackout dates, and its points don't expire. And while other airlines allow loyalty program members to transfer miles, they often charge a fee for the service. JetBlue's upgrades haven't stopped there. The airline is also moving to make its cross-country service between New York City and its West Coast cities San Francisco and Los Angeles more attractive for business class travelers. It announced its new premium "Mint" seating last month. Starting next summer and fall, certain flights between New York and the two West Coast cities will start offering fully flat beds, private suites, dual power outlets with USB ports, amenity kits and a tapas menu.

chatgpt: JetBlue, one of the largest low-cost airlines in the US, has announced that it will now allow family members to pool their loyalty points. Under the new policy, family members will be able to combine their TrueBlue loyalty points in order to earn and redeem rewards faster. JetBlue had previously announced that they have no blackout or expiration dates for redeeming points. Air traveler advocates applauded the move by JetBlue to make points easier to use. The new policy will be especially helpful for families who travel frequently or who have multiple people in their household who are members of JetBlue's loyalty program. By pooling their points, families will be able to accumulate points faster and reach redemption goals more quickly. This means that they can enjoy more flights, upgrades, and benefits with their accumulated points. JetBlue's TrueBlue loyalty program offers various benefits to its members, including free checked bags, bonus points on each flight, and exclusive access to special promotions and deals. The program is designed to reward frequent flyers and make their travel experience easier and more enjoyable. The new pooling policy is just the latest move by JetBlue to improve its loyalty program and make it easier for customers to earn and use points. The airline has also recently launched new features and services that are aimed at providing a more personalized and seamless travel experience. These include new technology that allows passengers to use their mobile devices to board their flights and new in-flight entertainment options. JetBlue is not the first airline to allow loyalty point pooling â€“ other airlines, such as British Airways and Emirates, also allow family members to combine their points. However, JetBlue's move is noteworthy because the airline is known for its customer-friendly policies and its emphasis on providing an affordable, comfortable travel experience for all passengers. Air traveler advocates praised JetBlue's new policy, saying that it will make the loyalty program more accessible and user-friendly for customers. They noted that many people are deterred from joining loyalty programs because they feel that the rules are too complex or that the value of the rewards is not worth the effort. With this new policy, JetBlue is making loyalty points more accessible and valuable, and is setting an example for other airlines to follow.
