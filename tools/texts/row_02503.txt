The fashion for a Hitler-style tash is spreading through the animal kingdom with a goldfish called George now getting in on the act. The five-year-old who belongs to Deborah Cochrane, from Belfast, has developed a distinctive black mark above his mouth which creates an uncanny resemblance to the fishist dictator. George and a fellow goldfish that has died were named after the art duo Gilbert and George. George follows in the pawsteps of a string of cats who became nicknamed 'Little Kitlers' for the dark patches of fur below their noses.

chatgpt: In a peculiar story out of San Francisco, a local resident has claimed that his pet goldfish has developed an unlikely affinity for peas – a peculiar dietary preference he claims the fish shares with none other than Adolf Hitler. The news came to light after the owner, who wished to remain anonymous, made the revelation on social media. According to him, the goldfish has taken a liking to peas and will refuse to eat anything else. He was initially baffled by this odd behaviour, but soon stumbled upon some curious reading material that shed light on the mystery. As it turns out, Hitler was apparently a fan of peas himself, and it is speculated that this could be the reason why the fish has developed an unusual obsession with the vegetable. But that's not all. The owner also claimed that his fish seems to show an unusual fondness for cats that bear a striking resemblance to the infamous dictator. He stated that the fish will follow these feline companions around the tank, often exhibiting curious behaviour towards them. While this may all seem like a bizarre coincidence, the owner claims that the evidence speaks for itself. He has posted several photos and videos online that show the fish in action – eating peas and trailing after cats that bear some resemblance to Hitler. The story has sparked a great deal of interest online, with many people expressing both amusement and concern over the strange behaviour of the goldfish. Some have pointed out that the owner may simply be projecting his own fascination with the dictator onto the behaviour of his pet, while others have questioned the ethics of keeping a fish in such peculiar conditions. Regardless of where one stands on the matter, this curious tale is a reminder of the strange and fascinating world of animal behaviour. Who knows what other unlikely preferences and habits we may discover in our animal companions in the future? Perhaps we'll even find a dog that loves to eat brussels sprouts, or a cat that has a fondness for classical music. Only time will tell.
