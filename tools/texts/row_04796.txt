article: Germany coach Joachim Low said he will be packing as many attacking midfielders and forwards as possible into his lineup for their Euro 2016 qualifier against minnows Gibraltar on Friday. The Germans are third in Group D after a below-par start to the campaign following their World Cup win in July and Low said it was crucial to finish the year on a high against Gibraltar and European champions Spain, who they face in a friendly on November 18. 'We are not satisfied, neither me, nor the team because we have too few points,' Low told reporters on Thursday. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Germany training ahead of Euro 2016 qualifying clash vs Gibraltar . Germany coach Joachim Low watches on during his side's training session in Nuremberg on Thursday . 'So we logically expect a win, not only reflected by the result but also by the way we will play. 'There will be many attacking players on the pitch tomorrow. We don't need four defenders at the back. We need players to set the tone up front,' he added. 'We do not talk about records. If we play our game tomorrow as we expect then we will score several goals. How many goals, I don't know but we want a big score, worthy of a World Cup winner.' Low shouts some instructions to his side as Toni Kroos (left) and Mario Gotze (right) listen in . This will be bad news for Gibraltar, a team made up of mainly amateur players who are policemen, firefighters and customs officers by profession. Gibraltar, a British overseas territory which borders the southern tip of Spain, was accepted as a UEFA member after a 14-year battle during which it faced fierce opposition from Spain. The team played their first international in September. The Germans, four-time World Cup winners, have managed just one win from their three qualifying games, losing to Poland and drawing with Ireland following a narrow opening win against Scotland. John O'Shea's late strike rescued a point for the Republic of Ireland against Germany in October . Low admitted World Cup euphoria had lifted them up high before they crashed back down to the football reality with their bad start to the Euro 2016 qualification. 'We were given this cloud of invincibility after the World Cup but crashed back down hard on reality,' he said. 'We are and will remain the world champions. But we have to learn to leave the past in the past. We have to be in the here and now and drive things forward in the coming months.'

chatgpt: German boss Joachim Low has declared his intentions to pack as many attacking midfielders and forwards as possible into his team's line-up as they take on minnows Gibraltar in their upcoming match on Friday. Germany, who currently occupy third place in Group D, have managed just one win from their three qualifying games, losing to Poland and drawing with Ireland following a narrow opening win against Scotland.  Low's side will be looking to secure a much-needed victory against Gibraltar, who they defeated 4-0 in their previous encounter. The coach will be hoping his new attacking strategy will provide the necessary firepower to overcome their opponents and secure three vital points in the race for Euro 2020 qualification. Despite their recent struggles, Low's side remain one of the strongest teams in Europe and will be looking to demonstrate their quality against Gibraltar, who are considered the weakest opponents in the group. However, the coach is aware that complacency could be the downfall of his team, and has called on his players to remain focused and not underestimate their opponents. Following Friday's match, Germany will turn their attention to a friendly against European champions Spain on November 18. Although the match does not carry any significance in terms of qualification, it will provide Low with the opportunity to test his team against one of the best sides in the world. Low's decision to pack his line-up with attacking talent is a clear indication that he is looking to take the game to both Gibraltar and Spain. With the likes of Leroy Sane, Julian Brandt, and Serge Gnabry all expected to feature, Germany will be hoping their attacking prowess will prove too much for their opponents to handle. The coach will also be looking to address his team's defensive frailties, which have been exposed in recent matches, particularly in their defeat to Poland. The absence of experienced center-back Jerome Boateng due to injury will add further pressure to a backline that has struggled to keep clean sheets in the qualifying campaign. With Germany's qualification hopes hanging in the balance, Low will be hoping his attacking strategy pays dividends against Gibraltar and sets the tone for a successful remaining qualifying campaign. The friendly against Spain will also provide an opportunity for the team to regroup and fine-tune their tactics ahead of the crucial matches to come. In conclusion, German boss Joachim Low's decision to pack his line-up with attacking talent is a clear indication of his intentions to take the game to both Gibraltar and Spain. With qualification hopes hanging in the balance, Low will be hoping his new strategy pays dividends and secures three vital points in the race for Euro 2020 qualification.
