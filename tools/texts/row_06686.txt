article: (CNN) -- Colombia's largest rebel group said it plans to release French journalist Romeo Langlois some two weeks after taking him "as a prisoner of war." Colombian rebels called for a committee composed of former Colombian Sen. Piedad Cordoba, a representative of newly elected French President Francois Hollande and the International Committee off the Red Cross to arrange for the journalist's transfer. Cordoba, a human rights activist, has been instrumental in many hostage releases involving the rebel group. She most recently spearheaded this year's release of the last 10 government hostages held by the guerrilla group. ICRC Spokesman Daniel Munoz said the group is ready facilitate the release. "We hope (the rebels) will contact us again, this time to give us a date and time," Munoz said. "We reiterate we are at their disposal with our boats, with our cars, with all our logistics, with all our delegates, anywhere in the country." Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said this month that his government would do whatever was necessary to guarantee Langlois' release. "The Colombian government is willing to provide all the facilities so the release occurs as quickly as possible, but if you really want to be viewed well by the world, release him now and simply tell us where he is and we will go get him. " Langlois, who works for France 24 and is a war reporter with more than 10 years experience in the country, was reporting alongside soldiers when the rebel group attacked, the Colombian government said. During the raid, a sergeant, two soldiers and a national police officer were killed, the Ministry of National Defense said; six others were injured. The Colombian government is expected to hold a hearing on the April 28 operation. Colombian defense minister Juan Carlos Pinzon, along with the Commandant of the Colombian Army Gen. Alejandro Navas are expected to take part.. Kidnapping government forces and civilians has been a key strategy of the rebel group. Dramatic rescues, escapes and hostage handovers have revealed harsh conditions in jungle camps, including stories of prisoners chained to trees, grueling marches between hideouts, torrential rain and blistering sun. While severely weakened in recent years, the rebels have continued to carry out kidnappings and attack security forces. The 10 hostages released last month were members of the military and police that FARC said were its last government hostages. In February, FARC also said it would stop kidnapping civilians for money. The rebels did not address the fate of its civilian captives then, nor did it renounce kidnapping for political purposes.

chatgpt: Romeo Langlois, a French reporter, has been missing since an April 28 rebel attack in Colombia. The journalist was covering a military operation against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in a remote region of Caqueta when the rebels attacked. The incident resulted in clashes between the army and the guerrillas, leaving Langlois missing. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) announced its readiness to assist in Langlois' release. The humanitarian organization is known for its efforts to secure the release of hostages worldwide. The ICRC has been instrumental in negotiating the release of several hostages held by the FARC in the past. Kidnapping government forces and civilians is a key strategy of the FARC, which has been engaged in a long-running insurgency against the Colombian government. However, the group has been under increasing pressure in recent years, with the government launching a series of military offensives against them. Langlois' abduction is the latest in a series of kidnappings carried out by the rebels in their fight against the government. Colombia's President Ivan Duque called on the FARC to release the journalist "and simply tell us where he is." Duque described Langlois as a "friend of the Colombian people" and stressed the importance of protecting journalists and freedom of the press in the country. Several international press freedom organizations have also called for Langlois' immediate release. The French embassy in Colombia has also weighed in on the matter, expressing concern for the journalist's safety and calling for his release. The French government has been working closely with its Colombian counterpart to secure Langlois' release and ensure his safe return to France. Langlois, who has been reporting on the conflict in Colombia for several years, is well-known among Colombian journalists and international correspondents for his in-depth coverage of the conflict. He has covered various aspects of the conflict, including the drug trade, human rights abuses, and the various peace negotiations between the government and the FARC. The disappearance of Langlois highlights the dangers faced by journalists reporting from conflict zones around the world. Despite the risks, many journalists continue to put themselves in harm's way to provide critical coverage of global events. The international community has a responsibility to protect the safety and rights of journalists, and to ensure that they are able to report freely and without fear of retribution. In conclusion, the fate of Romeo Langlois remains unknown, and the world waits anxiously for his safe return. As the search for the missing journalist continues, the international community must continue to call for his immediate release and an end to the brutal conflict that has plagued Colombia for decades.
