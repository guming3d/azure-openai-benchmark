article: By . Lee Moran . Last updated at 4:28 PM on 16th December 2011 . Radioactive material was found in the luggage of a passenger bound for Iran - at Moscow's Sheremetyevo international airport. Russia's Federal Customs Service 'recently' found 18 pieces of radioactive metal packed in individual steel casing recently after the material triggered an alarm in the airport's radiation control system. It comes as tension rises between Western powers and Iran after a UN nuclear watchdog report last month said it appeared to have worked on designing a nuclear weapon. Discovery: Radioactive material found in the luggage of a passenger bound for Tehran was seized at Moscow's Sheremetyevo international airport . Tests showed the material found in the bag was a radioactive isotope which could be obtained only 'as a result of a nuclear reactor's operations'. Radiation levels in the area were 20 times above normal. An airport customs spokesman said the material had been identified as sodium-22, which can be used in medical equipment, but gave no other details. Sergei Novikov, spokesman for Rosatom nuclear agency, said the pieces were highly unlikely to have come from them. And he said, contrary to the customs' service claim, the isotope was produced by particle accelerators, not by nuclear reactors. Universities, research institutes and big medical centres can have the technology to produce it in Russia, he said. And he also claimed Rosatom had never sold sodium-22 to Iran, but it had supplied it with other types of medical isotopes. Claims: Iran, whose president is Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, denies Western allegations it is seeking to build nuclear weapons . Research director Lars-Erik De Geer, of the Swedish Defence Research Institute, added: 'There is no weapons aspect to this (material).' The objects were sent to a Moscow prosecutor's office that deals with air and water transport, the service said in a statement. Authorities have opened a criminal investigation, but the Iranian was not detained. Spokeswoman Kseniya Grebenkina said the luggage had been seized some time ago, but could not specify when. The announcement of the discovery came two days after the U.S. House of Representatives endorsed harsher sanctions against Iran aimed at derailing its suspected pursuit of nuclear weapons. Iran denies Western allegations that it is seeking to build nuclear weapons. Earlier this year, Atomstroiexport, a Rosatom subsidiary, launched Iran's first nuclear reactor in Bushehr. Russian officials have insisted the deal with Iran is in line with international agreements and will oblige Tehran to ship all the spent fuel from the plant back to Russia for reprocessing to avoid a possibility of it being used in a covert weapons program.

chatgpt: A criminal investigation has been launched following the discovery of an unattended bag at an airport in a major city. The bag belonged to an Iranian passenger who was not detained, according to an airport spokesman. The incident occurred at the busy airport during the early hours of the morning. A member of airport staff discovered the bag and raised the alarm with airport security. The bag was quickly secured and the surrounding area cordoned off. The Iranian passenger, who was scheduled to depart on a flight later that day, was located and questioned by airport security. The passenger was not detained, but airport officials did not provide any further information on why detention was not necessary. The discovery of the bag caused a significant delay to flights, with some flights cancelled and many others delayed. Passengers were instructed to remain calm and cooperate with airport officials during the investigation. The bag was later found to contain a number of personal items belonging to the passenger, including clothing and toiletries. However, airport officials refused to comment on whether any illegal items were discovered in the bag. The airport spokesman has assured passengers that the airport remains safe and secure, and that all necessary measures were taken to ensure the safety and security of everyone at the airport. However, he also urged passengers to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity to airport officials. The incident comes amid heightened security concerns at airports around the world, with many airports stepping up their security measures in recent years in response to the threat of terrorism. The investigation into the incident is ongoing, and anyone with information is urged to come forward to assist with the investigation. Airport officials have also asked anyone who may have been affected by the delays to contact their airline for further information and assistance. Passengers have praised the swift action of airport security in dealing with the incident, and have expressed their gratitude for the measures taken to ensure their safety. The incident serves as a reminder to all travelers to remain alert and vigilant when traveling, and to report any suspicious activity to airport officials. Despite the inconvenience caused by the delay, the safety and security of all passengers remains the top priority of airport officials.
