article: Beijing (CNN) -- Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao underlined the Asian giant's regional military ambitions and economic challenges Monday in a speech that opened the annual meeting of the country's legislators. China intends to further tailor its military to ensure it is able to prevail in conflicts in its vicinity, Wen said in a speech to the National People's Congress, a 10-day gathering in Beijing of about 3,000 delegates from across the country. "We will enhance the armed forces' capability to accomplish a wide range of military tasks. Most important is to win local wars under information-age conditions," Wen said. His made his comments a day after China said it planned to increase its defense budget by 11.2% to some 670 billion yuan ($106.4 billion) this year, following similar increases in previous years and a renewed strategic push by the United States in the region. The focus on local conflicts is a key part of China's military blueprint -- the country is locked in territorial disputes with several of its neighbors. It regards Taiwan as part of its territory and has vowed to use force against the island if it ever formally sought independence. China has also claimed significant portions of the seas off its coast as its own territorial waters, putting it at loggerheads with other nations like Japan and Vietnam that have their own claims on the areas. As well as pouring more resources into the military, the authorities are also ramping up spending on internal security, according to a Ministry of Finance report released Monday. The document forecast that central and local government spending on police and other domestic security organs would increase to 701.8 billion yuan ($111.3 billion), from 629.3 billion yuan ($99.8 billion) in 2011.

China is grappling with unrest among its Tibetan population in southwestern regions and among the Uighur population in the far western province of Xinjiang. In his speech Monday, Wen also set a lower target for China's economic growth, underscoring the need to make the country's breakneck development more sustainable. The government is aiming for economic growth of 7.5% in 2012, Wen said, lower than the goal for last year of about 8%. But the Chinese economy often exceeds the official objective: last year it grew 9.2%. "China's economy is encountering new problems," he said. "There is downward pressure on economic growth. Prices remain high." Chinese officials are concerned about high inflation and perceptions of a growing divide between rich and poor, as well as the threat of faltering overseas demand for the country's exports. Wen also mentioned challenges the country faced in real estate, agriculture, land rights and food and drug safety. The National People's Congress at which Wen was speaking is constitutionally the highest organ of power in China, although it has long been considered a rubber-stamp parliament. It passes virtually every measure, resolution and law put forward by the government or the Communist Party. CNN's Steven Jiang contributed to this report.

chatgpt: The Chinese Prime Minster, Li Keqiang, has announced that the country aims to tailor its military to ensure it can win local conflicts. Speaking at the start of China's annual parliamentary gathering on Friday, Keqiang said that the country's military will be developed with a focus on local conflicts, and that China will not engage in any arms race with other nations. The move is seen as a sign of China's increasing assertiveness in regional matters. The country has been involved in territorial disputes with its neighbours, including Japan, Vietnam and the Philippines. China has also been building artificial islands in the South China Sea, which has been a source of tension with other regional powers. Keqiang's speech also addressed the country's economic growth, setting a lower target than in previous years. The Prime Minister announced that the government is targeting GDP growth of around 6.5% in 2017, down from the 6.7% growth that China saw last year. Keqiang also said that the government will continue to push for reforms, particularly in the state-owned enterprises, to address the risks that have arisen from years of rapid expansion. "China will continue to pursue a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy in 2017," Keqiang said. "We will also continue to deepen supply-side structural reforms, reduce excess capacity in some sectors and encourage innovation in others." The Chinese economy is undergoing a transformation as the government shifts its focus from manufacturing and exports to services and domestic consumption. The target for growth reflects the government's efforts to balance the need for continued economic development with the risks of debt and financial instability. The Prime Minister's announcement is in line with President Xi Jinping's call for a "new normal" in economic growth, with a focus on quality instead of quantity. The government has been promoting the "Made in China 2025" initiative, which aims to upgrade the country's manufacturing capabilities and encourage innovation in high-tech industries. The annual parliamentary gathering, known as the National People's Congress, is the country's largest political event, and provides an opportunity for leaders to set out their vision for the future. This year's gathering is particularly significant, as it marks the start of second term for President Xi. Xi has used his time in office to consolidate his power and promote his vision for a more assertive China on the global stage. His "One Belt, One Road" initiative aims to revive the ancient Silk Road trading routes and expand China's influence in the region. The initiative has been met with both enthusiasm and skepticism from other nations, particularly those in the West. As China continues to grow in economic and military power, the world will be watching closely to see how the country's leaders navigate the challenges that lie ahead.
