article: WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. Navy has moved the guided-missile destroyer USS Cole and other ships to the eastern Mediterranean Sea off Lebanon, Pentagon officials said Thursday.

The deployment comes amid a political standoff over Lebanon's presidency, but the Navy would not say whether the events are linked. "It's a group of ships that will operate in the vicinity for a while and as the ships in our Navy do, the presence is important," Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Thursday. "It isn't meant to send any stronger signal than that," he said. "But it does signal that we're engaged and we are going to be in the vicinity, and that's a very important part of the world." The Cole was badly damaged by an al Qaeda bombing during a port call in Yemen in 2000, killing 17 sailors. It returned to service in 2002. The destroyer and two support ships are close to Lebanon but out of visual range of the coast, Pentagon officials said. Another six vessels, led by the amphibious assault ship USS Nassau, are close to Italy and steaming toward the other three, the officials said. Mullen would not say whether the deployment has anything to do with the upcoming Lebanese parliamentary vote on a new president, which was postponed for a 15th time earlier this week. But he said the vote was "important," and Washington was waiting for it to take place. And a Bush administration official told CNN the decision to move ships to the region was a message to neighboringSyria that "the U.S. is concerned about the situation in Lebanon, and we want to see the situation resolved." "We are sending a clear message for the need for stability," said the official, who was not authorized to speak for publication. The ships "should be there a while," the official added. Lebanon's pro-Western majority in parliament and the pro-Syrian opposition have battled for power over the last three years. The country has been without a president since November, when pro-Syrian leader Emile Lahoud's term expired and parliament was unable to agree on a replacement. Despite general agreement among the factions to award the post to army chief Gen. Michel Suleiman, disagreements over how to share power in a future Cabinet have kept the issue from coming up for a vote. Parliament speaker Nabih Berri's office announced Tuesday that the next planned session has been pushed back to March 11. Berri's office said the Arab League needed more time to break the deadlock. Lebanon has been wracked by a sometimes-violent power struggle since the 2005 assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, whose supporters blamed Damascus for his killing. The resulting outcry eventually drove Syrian forces out of Lebanon, where they had been stationed since the 1970s. E-mail to a friend . CNN Correspondent Zain Verjee contributed to this report.

chatgpt: In the midst of a political impasse in Lebanon, the United States Navy has made a move that is being viewed as a show of support for the country's pro-Western leadership. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph Dunford, confirmed that the deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group to the eastern Mediterranean was a strategically important decision. "The presence is important," said General Dunford during a press briefing on Tuesday. "It's important in terms of our ongoing operations in the region. It's important in terms of our deep partnerships with countries like Lebanon who are on the front line of ensuring stability and security in this part of the world." Lebanon has been without a president since 2014, when Michel Sleiman's term ended without a successor being elected. The absence of a president has paralyzed the government and left the country vulnerable to sectarian tensions and sectarian violence. The situation has been exacerbated by the ongoing conflict in neighboring Syria, which has sent a flood of refugees across the border and created a haven for terrorist groups such as ISIS and Al-Nusra Front. Despite the efforts of the pro-Western majority in Lebanon's parliament, which has been trying to secure the election of a new president, the country remains divided. The March 14 coalition, which is backed by the United States and Saudi Arabia, supports the election of a pro-Western candidate, while the March 8 coalition, which is backed by Syria and Iran, supports the candidacy of Michel Aoun, a former general and politician who has aligned himself with the Hezbollah militant group. The deployment of the Abraham Lincoln Strike Group is seen by some as a message to the March 8 coalition, who have been accused of obstructing the election process in order to maintain their hold on power. The carrier strike group, which includes around 7,000 sailors and Marines, is a formidable display of American naval power and a signal to those who would wish to interfere in Lebanon's delicate politics. "The presence of the USS Abraham Lincoln is a clear signal to those who would seek to destabilize the region," said General Dunford. "It shows that the United States is committed to the security and stability of its allies, and that we will use all elements of our military power to defend those values." Some have criticized the move as being overly provocative and potentially escalating tensions in the region. The Iranian-backed Hezbollah group, which is a major player in Lebanese politics, has vowed to continue its resistance against what it sees as American aggression. "The deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln is a clear example of American interference in Lebanese affairs," said Hezbollah spokesman Hassan Fadlallah. "Lebanon does not need American ships or American soldiers to solve its problems. We will continue to fight against those who seek to divide our country and impose their will on our people." Despite these concerns, the deployment of the Abraham Lincoln Strike Group is seen by many as a necessary step to bolster Lebanon's pro-Western leadership and counter the influence of Syria and Iran. The ongoing political impasse in Lebanon is a major source of instability in the region, and the United States is keen to ensure that its allies are able to govern effectively in the face of these challenges. "The United States is committed to supporting the people of Lebanon in their efforts to build a peaceful, prosperous, and stable future," said General Dunford. "We will continue to work with our partners to ensure that Lebanon remains a key player in the region, and that its voice is heard in the halls of power."
