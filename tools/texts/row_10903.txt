article: (CNN) -- As you step closer to the artwork, it's as if you're venturing into a crimson-hued dreamscape, a psychedelic realm immersed in feverish landscapes and eerie sounds. Yet, this is no dream. Using a special and discontinued technology, which registers an invisible spectrum of infrared light, Irish artist and photographer Richard Mosse has captured beautiful and challenging imagery of people and landscapes in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Designed by the U.S. military in the 1940s for camouflage detection, the Kodak Aerochrome film renders the landscape in an unexpected light, turning shades of lush green into dramatic pinks and glowing reds. The result is both spectacular and shocking: Rolling hills appear dotted with candy-coated trees; river valleys are covered with pink savannah grasses; gun-holding soldiers, clad in purple uniforms, stroll under darkened skies. Set against the horrors of eastern DRC's humanitarian disaster, where more than five million people have died due to war-related causes since 1998, Mosse's surreal palette presents an alternative view of the region's complex situation.

It's this juxtaposition of alluring panoramas and defiant militia, of haunting beauty and unsettling violence, that forces viewers to pause and think. "The idea was to use this medium to see into the unseen, to reveal the hidden and make visible the invisible of this forgotten conflict," says Mosse, 33. "That works really on a very simple level through the color palette," he adds. "The pink is so surprising and shocking and unnatural that really makes people stop." Mosse first used infrared film in his highly praised 2011 photographic series "Infra," also about eastern DRC. He now takes that project a step further with "The Enclave," a multimedia installation that opened last weekend at the Irish Pavilion of the Venice Biennale in Italy. "The Enclave" is centred on a six-screen projection of a nearly 40-minute documentary, shot on 16mm infrared film. Throughout large parts of last year, Mosse traveled across eastern DRC with cinematographer Trevor Tweeten and composer Ben Frost. Embedded with armed militia, they captured video, stills and audio to create a powerful installation about the region's rebel groups and their surrounding communities. "There's no plot, there's no narrator, there's no dialogue -- it's very much a video art piece," says Mosse, who first travelled to eastern DRC in 2010.

We can't really make things up; it's really what we had the luck to capture and what we turned our sights on." Mosse says that at the heart of the project is an effort to bring "two counter-worlds into collision: art's potential to represent narratives so painful that they exist beyond language, and photography's capacity to document specific tragedies and communicate them to the world." "The Enclave" is exhibited at Fondaco Marcello in Venice until November 24.

chatgpt: Richard Mosse, an Irish artist known for his unconventional techniques, has stunned audiences with his latest work "The Enclave," a multimedia installation that blends infrared stills, video, and audio to depict the crisis in eastern Congo. The installation opened last weekend at the Venice Biennale in Italy and is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about pieces of the event. Using an infrared camera that is typically employed for military reconnaissance, Mosse captures hauntingly beautiful images of the Congolese landscape. The lush greenery of the region is transformed into a surreal, pinkish-orange tableau, while the people and militia groups that populate the area are rendered in shocking, vibrant reds. The effect is both haunting and mesmerizing, drawing the viewer in while simultaneously highlighting the violence and instability that has plagued the region. Mosse has previously described his approach as a way of "problematizing representation," using unconventional means to challenge the way we see and perceive the world around us. The installation includes six large screens that play a variety of images and video clips, some of which feature interviews with Congolese refugees recounting their experiences of displacement and violence. In one particularly moving moment, a woman describes the loss of her daughter in a brutal attack by a militia group. The audio component of "The Enclave" is equally powerful, featuring an original score by Ben Frost that adds an additional layer of intensity to the already mesmerizing visuals. Frost's music shifts from haunting, melancholy tones to pulsing, aggressive beats, mirroring the shifting moods and emotions of the images on screen. Mosse's work has garnered widespread recognition and acclaim, with many critics praising his ability to create beauty out of the most unlikely of subjects. However, some have criticized his approach as being voyeuristic, arguing that his focus on aesthetics obscures the very real suffering and trauma experienced by the Congolese people. In response to these criticisms, Mosse has emphasized that his work is not intended to be merely aesthetic or voyeuristic, but rather to draw attention to the complex political and social issues that underlie the crisis in Congo. He notes that the use of the infrared camera is a deliberate choice meant to highlight the often invisible nature of violence and conflict, making it more tangible and accessible to viewers. Regardless of one's perspective on Mosse's techniques, it is clear that "The Enclave" is a powerful and thought-provoking piece of art, one that forces us to confront the complexities and challenges of the world around us. As the installation continues to tour galleries and museums around the world, it is sure to leave a lasting impact on all those who have the opportunity to see it.
