article: (CNN)  -- Liverpool want to avoid playing on the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster and UEFA president Michel Platini says he will "do his utmost" to make it a reality. Liverpool fans had to be treated on the pitch as the tragedy unfolded at Hillsborough in 1989. The anniversary falls on April 15, one of two dates set aside for the second leg of this season's Champions League quarterfinal ties, the other being the previous day. European governing body UEFA issued a statement from Platini, rejecting reports that they had snubbed the appeal by Liverpool. "We are aware of the huge significance of the April 15 date for both Liverpool FC and their fans, and that is why we will do our utmost to make sure that the club does not have to play its UEFA Champions League second leg quarterfinal match on that day," Platini said. "This being the 20th anniversary of that tragic disaster in 1989 makes it even more relevant and we will take this into account." Ninety six people died when Liverpool supporters were crushed at the Leppings Lane end of Hillsborough on April 15, 1989, before the start of their team's FA Cup semifinal against Nottingham Forest. A cousin of Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard was among the dead, and the England midfielder has urged UEFA to be sympathetic to the club. Gerrard told Press Association at the weekend: "We're still waiting to see whether UEFA will make us play on the day. That would be far from ideal given all the emotion that always surrounds the club on that day." Liverpool have never played a game on the anniversary of the tragedy. The Champions League quarterfinal draw takes place on Friday with four English clubs in the draw and no seedings in place. Liverpool reached the quarterfinals with a superb 4-0 home win over Real Madrid last week and followed it up with a 4-1 thumping of Manchester United to revive their Premier League title hopes.

chatgpt: Liverpool FC, along with their fans, continue to be on edge over the upcoming Champions League quarterfinals, specifically with regards to the scheduled date of April 15th. This is due to the tragic Hillsborough disaster which claimed the lives of 96 Liverpool fans 20 years ago on the same date. As such, Liverpool have been anxious to avoid playing on April 15th to avoid any emotional turmoil that may be caused. It has been reported that UEFA President Michel Platini has personally intervened to ensure that Liverpool will not be playing on this significant date. Platini has guaranteed that either the 14th or 16th of April will be the allocated dates for Liverpool's quarterfinal matches. He also stated that the decision was made out of respect for the 96 fans who lost their lives on that fateful day, and to prevent any further emotional distress to Liverpool and its supporters. However, despite assurances by Platini, Liverpool has made it clear that they have not yet received any official confirmation from UEFA. A representative for the club stated that they would prefer to learn about their scheduled date as early as possible so they can adequately prepare themselves. The Hillsborough disaster occurred during the 1989 FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. Due to police negligence and overcrowding, 96 Liverpool fans were killed and over 700 were injured. The day has become a significant date in the history of not just Liverpool football club, but also English football as a whole. Furthermore, the Hillsborough tragedy had a significant impact on Liverpool's European football campaigns due to the resulting ban from UEFA competitions. Liverpool were banned from European competitions for six years following the tragedy, which would result in them missing out on potentially winning several European titles. Overall, it is clear that Liverpool fans continue to hold the Hillsborough tragedy close to their hearts. As such, UEFA's decision to avoid scheduling Liverpool matches on the 20th anniversary of the disaster is a respectful move that is sure to be well received by fans of the club. Liverpool remains hopeful that UEFA will confirm their quarterfinals date soon so they can start to focus on the games ahead.
