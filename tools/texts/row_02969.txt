article: (CNN) -- Three people died Thursday when a medical helicopter crashed in western Tennessee, the Federal Aviation Administration said. The helicopter had dropped off a patient in Jackson, Tennessee, and was returning to Brownsville, Tennessee, about 30 miles west of Jackson, when the crash was reported, said FAA spokesman Lynn Lunsford. Tennessee Emergency Management Agency spokesman Jeremy Heidt said the crash occurred shortly after 6 a.m. Three people were initially reported to be on board the helicopter, Lunsford said. All three were believed to be fatalities, as the aircraft -- a Eurocopter AS350 -- was burned, he said. Investigators were en route to the scene of the crash, a field near Brownsville, Lunsford said. CNN affiliate WMC-TV said the helicopter was operated by Hospital Wing. The organization identifies itself on its Web site as the Memphis Medical Center's air ambulance service. Hospital Wing said in a statement, reported by WMC-TV, that the crash occurred just east of Brownsville, and that three crew members and no patients were on board. The National Transportation Safety Board and the FAA are investigating, the statement said. "Nothing like this has ever happened in our history," Allen Burnette, Hospital Wing's director and chief operating officer, said in the statement. "A weather report said there were thunderstorms in the area, but that they had passed, Lunsford said. "The big weather system moving through had stopped a few moments before." Officials believe the helicopter was operating under a visual flight rules plan and not communicating with air traffic controllers, he said. Visual Flight Rules, or VFR, mean a flight is conducted under visual conditions. "There are operating guidelines in any aviation operation, but ultimately the pilot is responsible for (the) safety of (the) aircraft and deciding whether to go forward or not," Lunsford said. Hospital Wing was founded in 1985, the group's statement said, and is a nonprofit air medical transport service with direct alliances with the Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare, Baptist Memorial Hospital, The MED, St. Francis Hospital in Memphis and Crittenden Memorial Hospital in West Memphis, Arkansas.

chatgpt: A helicopter carrying three crew members made an unexpected landing in Jackson, Tennessee on Wednesday, after it dropped off a patient and was returning to its home base in Brownsville. Emergency responders rushed to the scene, but thankfully, there were noÂ injuries reported. According to local officials, the helicopter was likely using visual flight rules, which means it was flying without communicating with air traffic controllers. Such rules allow pilots to fly in good visibility conditions, but they are required to remain vigilant and avoid obstacles. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) investigators are at the scene to determine the cause of the incident. The FAA has not yet released any official statement on the matter. The helicopter that landed in Jackson belongs to Air Evac Lifeteam, a medical transportation company based in Tuscumbia, Alabama. The incident has raised concerns about whether there were any violations in the operations of the helicopter. The FAA has extensive rules and regulations in place to ensure the safety of pilots, crew members, and passengers. However, in some cases, mistakes can happen, or rules may be inadvertently ignored. In such cases, investigations are launched to determine the root cause of the incident. While there is no indication of any malfunctions with the helicopter, the incident is being treated seriously, and investigators will be looking into all possible angles, including the possibility of human error or technical problems. The FAA takes safety issues seriously and will undoubtedly take all steps necessary to ensure that such incidents do not happen again in the future. In the meantime, Air Evac Lifeteam has issued a statement confirming that none of their crew members or patients were injured in the incident. They also expressed their gratitude to the emergency responders who arrived at the scene promptly and offered assistance. The use of helicopters for medical transportation has grown significantly in recent years due to their ability to transport patients quickly and efficiently over long distances. However, incidents such as this serve as a reminder of the importance of following safety protocols at all times when operating such aircraft. The investigation into the incident is ongoing, and further information will be shared as it becomes available.
