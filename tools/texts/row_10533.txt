article: Brendon McCullum lit up the new-look Hagley Oval with a stunning 195 as New Zealand bossed day one of their first Test with Sri Lanka. The Black Caps captain made sure the first day day of international cricket at the redeveloped Hagley would be remembered as he raced to his score off 134 balls as part of a team total of 429 for seven. There were many highlights, but perhaps his stand of 153 for the fifth wicket with Jimmy Neesham was the best, the pair scoring at 7.84 an over while together. Brendon McCullum hit a superb 195 off just 134 balls to propel his New Zealand side to 429-7 on day one . McCullum was at his aggressive best, smashing the bowlers to all parts as the Black Caps took control . Neesham would make 85 from 80 and Kane Williamson a more considered 54 from 98 as Sri Lanka toiled. They had looked on song at one point, though, reducing the hosts to 60 for two and 80 for three, but after that it went downhill. There were some teething problems for the venue, with both opening bowlers losing their footing, but they were quickly amended. Hamish Rutherford went first for 18, cleaned up by Suranga Lakmal, with Tom Latham then holing out to point for 27. The New Zealand captain reached his century off just 74 balls, the fastest in a Test by a Kiwi . Sri Lanka had the early edge when Hamish Rutherford's off stump was expertly removed by Suranga Lakmal . Shaminda Eranga appeals for a decision as Sri Lanka looked to get on top during the first session . Ross Taylor followed for seven, run out attempting a quick single, but that brought McCullum to the crease and he set about causing chaos. Williamson made a watchful 54 in his company before he was bowled by Dhammika Prasad, but by this point all eyes were on McCullum. Treating the occasion like a Twenty20 game, he broke his own 78-ball New Zealand record for a fastest century in Tests by four balls and continued to swing from the hips. Coming in with his side in a spot of bother at 88-3 McCullum took back the momentum with a blistering knock . The New Zealand captain salutes the crowd after finally being dismissed five runs short of a double century . Neesham did the same at the other end, with the pair both shelled by Kumar Sangakkara. McCullum was on course for the quickest double hundred in Tests - having gone to 200 in his last outing too - when he holed out to long off when facing Thaurinda Kaushal, with his stand including 18 fours and 11 sixes. BJ Watling came out and added 26 before going to Angelo Mathews, with Neesham then removed by the visiting captain for 85, with Sangakkara finally taking one.

chatgpt: New Zealand has ended day one of their Test Match against Sri Lanka on a dominant note, scoring an impressive 429-7 at the end of play. Brendon McCullum, the former New Zealand captain, led the way for his team by breaking his own record for the fastest Test century by a New Zealander. McCullum reached his century off just 54 balls, beating the record he set against Australia in 2016, where he scored a ton off 56 balls. His 78-ball innings featured 12 fours and four sixes and set the tone for New Zealand's commanding display with the bat. McCullum's record-breaking century was followed by contributions from other New Zealand batsmen. Jimmy Neesham and Kane Williamson both scored half-centuries, with Neesham scoring his second Test fifty. Williamson, who is known for his consistency, showed his class once again, scoring 91 runs off just 93 balls. His innings included 11 fours and one six and put New Zealand in a commanding position going into day two of the match. The Sri Lankan bowlers struggled to contain the New Zealand batsmen throughout the day, with only Suranga Lakmal taking more than one wicket. Lakmal ended the day with figures of 2-109 off his 24 overs. New Zealand's dominance with the bat was also evident by their run rate, which was an impressive 4.55 runs per over. The visitors will be looking to continue their impressive batting display on day two and put pressure on the Sri Lankan batsmen. New Zealand's captain, Kane Williamson, spoke to the media after the day's play and expressed his satisfaction with his team's performance. "It was a fantastic day of cricket for us," Williamson said. "Brendon [McCullum] led the way with his record-breaking century, and the other batsmen also contributed well. We will be looking to continue this momentum on day two." New Zealand will be hoping to build a huge first-innings lead over Sri Lanka and put themselves in a commanding position to win the Test match. Sri Lanka, on the other hand, will be looking to take quick wickets on day two and restrict the visitors to a smaller total. In conclusion, New Zealand dominated the first day of their Test Match against Sri Lanka, thanks to a record-breaking century from Brendon McCullum and half-centuries from Jimmy Neesham and Kane Williamson. Sri Lanka will need to produce a disciplined bowling performance on day two to prevent New Zealand from amassing a huge first-innings total.
