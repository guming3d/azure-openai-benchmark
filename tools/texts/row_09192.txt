article: (CNN) -- Downpours subsided temporarily in the Philippines on Sunday, a day after Tropical Storm Ketsana pummeled the capital Manila with its heaviest rainfall in more than 40 years. Filipino pedestrians in Quezon City, a suburb of Manila, brave Tropical Storm Ketsana's floodwaters. Flood spawned by the rainfall killed at least 75 people with at least 21 others missing, the government said. More than 80 percent of the capital was under water that swallowed whole houses and buses. Manila, in the island of Luzon, and the nearby province of Rizal bore the brunt of the storm. People huddled on rooftops Sunday waiting on army helicopters to pluck them to safety. Others used ropes to wade through waist-deep muddy waters. Power and water supply failed in some areas. Roads were rendered impassable, making rescue efforts challenging. Are you there? Share your story or pictures . "Right now the challenge is to find out how many people have actually died and how many people we have to take care of in terms of people who've been displaced," said Richard Gordon, the chairman of the Philippines National Red Cross. "We're really talking about maybe hundreds of thousands of people," with about 280,000 to 300,000 displaced in the island of Luzon alone, he said. Though the Philippines is no stranger to floods, Saturday's downpours approached a record, with a month's worth of rain falling within six hours. The average rainfall for the entire month of September is 391 mm (15.4 inches), said Gilberto Teodoro, secretary of national defense and chairman of the National Disaster Coordinating Council. The capital experienced 341 mm (13.4 inches) between 8 a.m. and 2 p.m., he said. Officials worried that if the rains return, they could bring more floods if reservoirs burst. "We're hoping that there will be no more breaching of the dams," Gordon said. "That's one of the things that are very disconcerting to many people right now." Mike Anthony Catuira spent Sunday retrieving valuable belongings and seeking cover on higher ground. Overflowing rivers in the municipality of Tanay in Rizal province had inundated shops and homes, he said. "The storm's local name 'Ondoy' is really a powerful storm, and this is the most severe storm in my whole life," he said in a report to iReport, the CNN Web site that allows people to submit pictures and videos.

chatgpt: The Philippines is reeling from the devastating effects of Tropical Storm Ketsana. The disaster has left more than 75 people dead and up to 300,000 displaced, according to Red Cross officials. The government has launched massive relief operations to assist those affected by the flooding. The storm, which hit the northern Philippines over the weekend, caused flooding in Manila and neighboring provinces. The deluge overwhelmed the drainage systems and triggered landslides, leading to widespread destruction and loss of lives. The rescue and relief efforts are ongoing, with authorities working tirelessly to reach those in need. The Red Cross has deployed volunteers to the affected areas, providing emergency shelters, food, water, and medical assistance. The humanitarian organization has also launched an appeal for funds to support the relief efforts. The Philippine government has allocated resources to aid in the recovery process, including deploying military personnel to assist in rescue operations. The provincial government of Rizal, one of the hardest-hit areas, has declared a state of calamity. The declaration allows for the mobilization of additional resources to address the disaster. Local officials have called for the public's help in the form of donations of food, clothing, and other essentials. President Rodrigo Duterte has expressed his condolences to the bereaved families and ordered government agencies to provide assistance to the victims. The president has also directed authorities to intensify efforts to prevent similar calamities in the future. The storm has disrupted normal life in the affected areas, with schools and businesses forced to close. The floods have also caused extensive damage to infrastructure, including roads and bridges. The recovery process is expected to take time, with efforts focused on restoring basic amenities and helping those affected to rebuild their lives. The disaster highlights the susceptibility of the Philippines to natural disasters such as typhoons and floods, owing to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire. The government has faced criticism in the past for its inadequate response to similar disasters. However, this time, authorities appear to be taking the necessary measures to mitigate the effects of the storm and provide relief to those affected. The Philippine people have a history of resilience in the face of adversity, as demonstrated in the aftermath of previous natural disasters. The current calamity will test their spirit once again, but with the support of the international community, it is hoped that they can overcome the challenges and rebuild their lives.
