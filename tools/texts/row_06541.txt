article: (CNN) -- George Zimmerman, who was acquitted of murder in the shooting death of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin last month, visited a gun manufacturer Thursday, TMZ reported. The celebrity gossip site TMZ published a picture of Zimmerman smiling and shaking hands with someone it said was an employee of the gunmaker, Kel-Tec. It said Zimmerman asked about the KSG compact 12-gauge shotgun while he was there. Zimmerman's brother, Robert, confirmed to CNN by text message that is was George in the photo. Kel-Tec is headquartered in Cocoa, Florida. The company manufactures, assembles and repairs its line of weapons, and its facility contains a shooting range but does not sell guns, according to its website. Kel-Tec manufactures the PF-9, the type of gun Zimmerman used to shoot Martin. A jury acquitted Zimmerman in July of second-degree murder in Martin's February 2012 death. The neighborhood watch volunteer, now 29, killed the 17-year-old as he walked to his father's fiancee's house through a gated community in Sanford, Florida. Zimmerman had called 911 to report Martin as a suspicious person. He acknowledges killing Martin but says it was in self-defense after the two had a confrontation. His parents said Zimmerman and his family received many death threats after the acquittal. Zimmerman's defense attorney, Mark O'Mara, described his client as a marked man who wore a disguise and often strapped on body armor when he left home. O'Mara said Zimmerman must now be protective of his safety because of the threats against him. TMZ also reported that O'Mara went to the gun facility with Zimmerman, but O'Mara told CNN he was not there and was in court at the time.

chatgpt: TMZ, the popular celebrity gossip site, has published a photo of George Zimmerman, the man who was acquitted of the murder of teenager Trayvon Martin last month. The photo shows Zimmerman shaking hands with an apparent employee. According to TMZ, Zimmerman was at the gun shop to inquire about a compact shotgun. The photo has sparked controversy, with many wondering what Zimmerman might need a gun for so soon after the highly publicized trial. Zimmerman's brother, Robert, confirmed to CNN that it was indeed George in the photo. Some have criticized TMZ for giving oxygen to a figure who has caused so much pain and division in the country. Others defended the site's decision to publish the photo, arguing that it is newsworthy and in the public interest. Zimmerman's lawyer, Mark O'Mara, said that his client is entitled to go about his life like anyone else. "George has been offered security in the wake of the trial, but he has chosen not to have protection at this time," O'Mara said in a statement. "He is free to come and go as he pleases." The publication of the photo comes at a time when tensions surrounding the Trayvon Martin case are already high. The verdict sparked protests across the country, with many people arguing that Zimmerman should have been found guilty. The photo will likely be seen as another indication of Zimmerman's disregard for the consequences of his actions. The compact shotgun that Zimmerman inquired about is legal in the state of Florida, where he resides. However, some experts are concerned that he may be seeking weapons that are specifically designed for close-range combat. Whatever the case may be, many people will be keeping a close eye on Zimmerman in the coming months, and watching to see how he chooses to move forward after the trial.
