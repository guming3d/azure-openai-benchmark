article: (CNN)Madonna is stringing us along again and not everyone is happy about it. Never one to stray far from provocative images, the pop star has released altered pictures of iconic figures to match the artwork for her upcoming album "Rebel Heart." In the cover art, Madonna's head is wrapped in black cord. No one said much when her Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts pushed out altered visages of Jesus, Marilyn Monroe, the Grinch, Homer Simpson and the like. But things got a bit chippy when Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela and Bob Marley showed up on Friday, like Madonna, all wrapped in black cord. Social media lit up, many questioning her use of the civil rights icons to promote her album. "Is this some kind of a joke ???" Pastor Viwe Pobana said on Twitter in response to the Mandela image. This is outrageous and needs urgent intervention." "What ever the intended meaning is... I think poor taste!" tweeted Nelson R Ferreira. Not all the comments were negative, but enough were that by late Friday Madonna had issued a rambling apology on her official Facebook page laced with grammatical errors and misspellings. "I'm sorry . "I'm not comparing my self to anyone . "I'm admiring and acknowledging there Rebel Hearts . "This is niether a crime or an insult or racist! "I also did it with Michael jaclson and frida khalo and marilyn monroe . "Am I saying I am them . "NO . "I'm saying they are Rebel Hearts too. "And . "I didn't do it . "My fans did . "And I just re posted those photos . "My fans aren't racist either . "If they put me in the same category as these other people . "Thank you. I'm very flattered and I hope one day to live up to 1 100th of what those people accomplished." - Madonna . Following the post, comments by the hundreds peppered her official Facebook page -- from detractors and defenders alike. "Who would have thought such an icon could allow herself to cheapen her image with such juvenile social media posts and horrific grammar and spelling mistakes?" said Iain Precht . "Blah, blah, blah, your sounding alittle defensive madonna, not like you at all," said a post from Thomas Greifenstein Sr. Freitas Neto said, "U dont need explaining yourself. YOU ARE MADONNA!" And it was all pretty simple for supporter Mario Molina. "rebel heart = activist. mlk and mandela = activsts. duh." Madonna responds to leak, releases songs as Christmas gift . Madonna's new album isn't expected to be out in its entirety until spring, but six tracks were released last month ahead of schedule after unfinished versions of her newest songs found their way onto the Internet. Leaks have tormented Madonna in the past. In 2003, the singer's website was defaced, and last month, every song off her "American Life" album was leaked online. CNN's Joe Sutton contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Madonna, the pop icon, recently found herself in hot waters after posting a series of photos titled "Gone But Not Forgotten" on Twitter. The pictures featured well-known civil rights leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela, and Bob Marley, with captions that promoted her upcoming album. Social media users were quick to criticize the move, calling it insensitive and disrespectful to use such important figures for mere promotional purposes. The hashtag #MadonnaIsOverParty began trending on Twitter, with thousands of users voicing their disappointment in the singer. Some users also pointed out that Madonna misspelled Mandela's name in one of her captions, causing even more frustration and anger among her detractors. In response to the backlash, Madonna issued an apology on social media, stating that she never intended to disrespect or offend anyone. She explained that her intention was to pay homage to the leaders who inspired her, and she was sorry for any offense she may have caused. However, her apology did little to quell the outrage, as the statement itself contained grammatical and spelling errors. Many users pointed out that if Madonna wanted to show respect to these iconic figures, she should have taken the time to proofread her statement before posting it. The criticism only continued to pour in, with users questioning Madonna's sincerity and calling for her to make a more meaningful gesture to apologize. Some suggested that she make a donation to organizations that support civil rights causes or partner with activists who work to combat inequality. Madonna is no stranger to controversy, but this incident highlights the importance of being mindful and respectful of the legacies of those who paved the way for social justice. It also serves as a reminder that words matter, and a lack of attention to detail can have serious consequences. As social media continues to play an increasingly important role in shaping public opinion and holding public figures accountable, it's crucial for celebrities to recognize the power of their platform and the impact their actions can have on society. In the case of Madonna, her misstep serves as a cautionary tale for those who may be tempted to use important figures or causes for personal gain. As much as it is important to focus on self-promotion and marketing, it is also important to respect and honor those whose memories we seek to keep alive.
