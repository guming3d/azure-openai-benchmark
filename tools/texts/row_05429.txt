If you spot something unusual in the sky over Wiltshire today, don’t be alarmed. It’s not a UFO but the Army’s newest unmanned aircraft, sent up to capture images of the countryside below. The ‘spy in the sky’ can fly for longer than drones currently used in Afghanistan and  provide clearer pictures to troops on the ground. It will be tested over Wiltshire from today, before being deployed in the summer. Scroll down for video . Keeping watch: The Watchkeeper WK450 pictured during a test flight. It will be undergo a testing phase this week before deployment next summer . Design: It is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for all weather and its primary uses are intelligence gathering, surveillance and target acquisition . The Watchkeeper – which has a 33ft wingspan – can fly for 16 hours, sending real-time images to pilots on the ground, who control it from up to 100miles away. It also boasts better cameras than previous models. It is expected after MoD trails finish the pilotless surveillance aircraft - which boasts better cameras and sensors than previous models - will be deployed this Summer. Colonel Mark Thornhill, commander of the 1st Artillery Brigade, said: ‘It is a highly capable and very robust system that will be used to provide intelligence and surveillance for the ground forces from 16,000ft.’ The primary roles will be to provide intelligence, surveillance and target acquisition capabilities in direct support of the ground command. Crew: Sergeant Matt Long operates operates a simulated flight deck for reconnaissance and surveillance aircraft Watchkeeper . 'Compared to other unmanned air system (UAS) it can fly for longer, it can flu off rough strips, it has better sensors and all together a much better capability. 'It allows us to provide real-time imagery down to the ground commander so that he can then take appropriate action depending upon what he sees and what he learns from that imagery. 'Therefore, he will be able to perform in a much better fashion and make much better operational decisions based on the imagery we are providing to him.' When asked of plans to send the drones to Afghanistan, he said: 'At the moment that is an operational decision.' Pilots will go through six months of training at Larkhill in Wiltshire. Despite fears over the safety of unmanned drones, Colonel Thornhill insisted: ‘It is very safe. They are certified in exactly the same way that a manned aircraft has been certified.’ Display: The aircraft was unveiled today at Boscombe Down in Wiltshire and is manufactured by Thales .

chatgpt: The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) has announced the testing of a new unmanned aerial vehicle called the Watchkeeper that will take to the skies starting today. The aircraft boasts a 33-ft wingspan and can remain aloft for up to 16 hours while being controlled from up to 100 miles away.  The Watchkeeper is designed to provide intelligence, surveillance, and target acquisition capabilities, making it an indispensable tool for modern military operations. The aircraft is equipped with a range of sensors and cameras that allow it to provide real-time imagery and video of the battlefield.  The testing phase of the Watchkeeper is being carried out by a team of experts at a remote airfield in the UK. The team will be responsible for evaluating the aircraft's performance, testing its various systems and equipment, and assessing its ability to operate in different environments and conditions.  One of the key advantages of the Watchkeeper is its ability to provide round-the-clock surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities. This means that it can be deployed in a variety of situations, such as monitoring suspicious activity on the ground, tracking enemy movements in real-time, and assisting in search and rescue operations.  The Watchkeeper is also designed to be highly adaptable, meaning it can be easily reconfigured to suit different missions and objectives. For example, it can be equipped with different types of cameras and sensors to collect specific types of data, such as thermal imaging or radar.  The development of the Watchkeeper represents a major step forward in the field of unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs. UAVs are becoming increasingly popular in military operations as they offer numerous advantages over traditional manned aircraft, such as lower costs, increased endurance, and reduced risk to human operators.  However, there are also concerns about the use of UAVs, particularly when it comes to issues such as privacy and safety. There have been reports of UAVs being used for surveillance in civilian areas, raising concerns about the potential for abuse. Additionally, there have been concerns about the safety of UAVs when operating in close proximity to other aircraft or in public areas.  Despite these concerns, the MoD is confident that the Watchkeeper will prove to be a valuable asset in future military operations. The testing phase is expected to last for several months, after which the aircraft will be deployed for active service.  Overall, the introduction of the Watchkeeper is yet another indication of the growing use of UAVs in military operations around the world, and represents a significant step forward in the development of this technology. While there are certainly concerns and challenges that need to be addressed, it seems likely that UAVs will continue to play an increasingly important role in future military operations.
