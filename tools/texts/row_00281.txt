article: It seems that almost everyday there's a new advertisement for the last must-have piece of technology. But IKEA just one-upped the competition with the announcement of their 2015 catalogue aka 'bookbook' - a play on Apple's MacBook. This parody video is particularly timely as Apple gears up to launch the new iPhone with what will surely be a hyperbolic and exquisitely designed ad campaign. Scroll down for video . IKEA's new advertisement for their 2015 catalogue is a blatant parody of Apple's ad campaigns . 'The first thing to note is no cables,' the satirical ad points out . 'The interface is 7.5 x 8 inches. But can expand to 15 x 8 inches,' the narrator explains . 'Once in awhile, something comes along that changes the way we live,' the advertisement begins. 'A device so simple and intuitive, using it feels almost familiar.' 'Introducing the 2015 IKEA catalogue.' 'The first thing to note is no cables - not even a power cable,' Jurgen continues. 'Not even a power cable. The 2015 IKEA catalogue comes fully charged and the battery life is eternal.' The entire advert is narrated by Jorgen Eghammer, dubbed the Chief Design Guru . The advert demonstrates the 'bookbook's' unique ability to expand its interface - simply by opening it . 'Navigation is based on tactile touch technology. To start browsing, scroll right to left to move forward and left to right to move backward.' 'Notice something else? That’s right – no lag. Each crystal clear page loads instantaneously, no matter how fast you scroll.' And when it comes to bookmarking, the 'bookbook' has that covered, too. 'If you find something you want to save for later, simply bookmark it,' the model demonstrates by turning down the top corner of the page. 'Content comes pre-installed via 328 high definition pages,' Jurgen teases in the video . 'Even if you close the application, you can easily find the bookmark again. Amazing.' For multiple users, the 2015 IKEA catalogue offers a colour-coded tab system to avoid confusion. 'If you want to share a particularly inspiring item, you literally share it.' 'Another special feature is password protection, which is voice-activated.' All you need to say is: ‘Excuse me, that’s mine!’ 'At IKEA, we feel that technology is life-enhancing and should be at the hands of everyone,' the advert concludes. 'So, the 2015 IKEA catalogue is free.' The advert also joking offers voice-activated security protection. Simply say, 'Excuse me! That's mine!' Behold IKEA's colour-coded system software - if you'd like to share a page with a friend, simply place a tab on it .

chatgpt: Furniture giant IKEA has taken a page out of Apple's book with its latest ad campaign for the 2015 catalogue. In a hilarious parody of Apple's famous MacBook ads, IKEA pokes fun at the tech company's hyperbolic advertising style. The ad, which has been making the rounds on social media, features a narrator introducing the "latest must-have technology" - the IKEA catalogue. The narrator uses phrases similar to those in Apple's advertisements, such as "It's not just a book, it's a breakthrough," and explains how the IKEA catalogue is "thin and lightweight." The ad's pièce de résistance, however, is the use of the phrase "bookbook." In a nod to Apple's tendency to append "book" to the end of its product names, IKEA takes it one step further by doubling down on the term. The narrator explains that the "bookbook" is "familiar yet totally new," and compares the sensation of holding one to "holding the world." The ad ends with a shot of the IKEA catalogue being closed with a satisfying thud, followed by a tagline that reads "Experience the power of the bookbook." Social media users have praised the ad for its cleverness and humor. Many have noted that IKEA's parody is a refreshing change from the usual overly serious advertising that dominates the tech industry. While the ad may be lighthearted, IKEA's focus on its catalogue as a piece of technology is not entirely misplaced. The company has been investing heavily in digital technology in recent years, with a particular focus on mobile apps that allow customers to browse and purchase items from their smartphones. In 2013, IKEA launched its first augmented reality app, which allows customers to preview furniture in their homes using their mobile devices. The app has been a hit with customers, and IKEA has continued to develop its digital offerings, with plans to invest over $2 billion in e-commerce and digital operations by 2020. The bookbook ad campaign is the latest in a series of playful ads from IKEA, which has become known for its offbeat approach to advertising. Previous campaigns have included a series of ads poking fun at Americans' inability to pronounce IKEA product names, as well as a series of print ads that highlighted the company's Swedish roots by depicting products as classic works of Scandinavian literature. As for the bookbook ad, it's hard to argue with its effectiveness. The spot has already garnered millions of views and has helped to elevate the IKEA brand as a fun, irreverent company that doesn't take itself too seriously. And in the end, isn't that what advertising is all about?
