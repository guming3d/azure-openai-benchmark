A test used for heart disease is 'flawed' and may be leading to thousands of patients being given the wrong treatment, an expert has warned. Professor Nick Curzen said that x-rays for angina - a painful tightening of the chest - give inaccurate results in a quarter of all patients. The tests, called angiograms, involve patients being given a local anaesthetic while a long tube is inserted into their groin or arm up to the coronary artery in the heart. Flawed: According to Professor Curzen, angiograms are inaccurate in 26 per cent of cases . A dye is then passed through the tube while a series of x-rays are taken which show up any blockages in the arteries. Professor Curzen, a consultant cardiologist at Southampton General Hospital, said the x-rays do not give a precise reading on whether blood flow is restricted. He said angiograms should be used alongside another procedure which involves inserting a tiny wire into arteries which measure the blood pressure. Professor Curzen carried out a trial on 200 patients which showed that angiograms led to the wrong treatment in 26 per cent of cases. During the trial patients were given angiograms and doctors then decided on their treatment. They then underwent the second procedure, a fractional flow reserve test, and doctors were asked if they would change the treatment. In 26 per cent of cases they did. Faulty: The test is supposed to pick up arterial blockages such as the one above but doesn't always get it right . Professor Curzen said: 'The results indicate management of patients with stable angina by angiogram alone is probably flawed and treatment would be much more tailored to the individual through routine use of a FFR pressure test at the diagnostic stage.' He now wants to conduct a much larger trial in the hope it will lead to a 'major change' in the way tests are done. About one in seven men and one in 12 women over 65 suffer from angina although it is also common in patients in their fifties. It occurs when the arteries supplying blood to the heart become narrowed resulting in a heavy, tight pain that can spread to the arms and neck. Angina is a form of heart disease and patients may go on to suffer heart attacks and strokes if it is not properly treated. Patients are given a spray or pills to take once an attack starts and other drugs to help prevent them.

chatgpt: According to a recent study conducted by Professor Nick Curzen, a cardiologist at a leading medical institute, angiograms are inaccurate 26% of the time. Professor Curzen presented his findings in a statement following a trial that involved 200 heart patients. The results reveal that flawed angiograms often lead to inappropriate treatment being prescribed, causing serious health implications for patients. Angiograms are medical procedures used to visualize the heart and blood vessels. A dye is injected into the bloodstream while X-rays are taken, creating an image of the heart and its blood vessels. These images determine whether or not a patient needs treatment such as surgery, medication or lifestyle changes. The study conducted by Professor Curzen revealed that incorrect angiogram results can cause a patient to receive ineffective and potentially harmful treatment. Inaccurate angiograms result in inappropriate treatment being prescribed to patients, leading to unfavorable outcomes. According to Professor Curzen, another procedure should be used alongside angiograms, to ensure that patients receive accurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment. Professor Curzen suggests the use of the Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) test, which analyzes blood flow through the heart and allows for a more accurate assessment of the extent of blockages in the arteries. The results of the study are significant, indicating the need for doctors and cardiologists to be more vigilant in their diagnoses of heart disease. By utilizing the FFR test, doctors can provide a more accurate assessment of the patientâ€™s heart health, allowing for more effective treatment and ultimately saving lives. The findings of Professor Curzen's study have also been welcomed by leading medical organizations such as the American Heart Association, who have stated that the use of the FFR test can lead to a reduction in unnecessary invasive procedures and more appropriate treatment. The importance of accurate diagnoses in heart disease cannot be overstated. Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, and accurate diagnoses and proper treatment can significantly improve patient outcomes. Professor Curzen's study underscores the significance of ensuring that cardiologists employ the most accurate diagnostic methods to diagnose and treat patients with heart disease.    In conclusion, the results of Professor Curzen's study underscore the need for more effective diagnostic procedures to assess patients with heart disease. The use of the Fractional Flow Reserve test alongside angiograms is a step towards ensuring that patients receive the most accurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment for their heart disease. Increased efforts towards more accurate assessments of heart health must continue in earnest to help save lives and improve patient outcomes.
