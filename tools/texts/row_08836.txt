After saying they are a brand that has long 'supported women and stood for female empowerment,' they called on the NFL 'to take swift action on their path forward to address the issue of domestic violence.' The brand, which bills itself as the 'official beauty sponsor of the NFL,' became a part of the discussion regarding the league's handling of domestic abuse offenses over the weekend when photoshopped versions of their NFL ads depicting battered women went viral.

We developed our NFL program to celebrate the more than 80 million female football fans. In light of recent events, we have encouraged the NFL to take swift action on their path forward to address the issue of domestic violence.' Unfortunately, this was not enough for some of those 80 million female football fans the cosmetic giant claims to be reaching with their NFL partnership, who called on parent company Procter & Gamble to do more in the wake of the two recent high profile domestic abuse incidents involving star players Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson. Some are even urging a boycott of CoverGirl on Twitter until they take stronger action or withdraw their sponsorship entirely.

The photshopped ads were not even originally meant as an attack on CoverGirl, but rather an attempt to shame NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, using the hashtag #GoodellMustGo. This comes after video of Rice punching then-fiancée Janay Palmer went public last Monday, and Peterson was indicted on charges of reckless or negligent injury to a child on Friday for an incident in which he hit his son with a switch back in May. Rice has been indefinitely suspended from the NFL and had his contract terminated by the Baltimore Ravens, while Peterson, who was sidelined by the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday, will return to team play this weekend.

chatgpt: CoverGirl is standing by the NFL despite recent scandals involving players accused of domestic violence. In a statement released by the company, CoverGirl reaffirmed its commitment to "empowering women" and emphasized that domestic violence of any kind is "completely unacceptable."  CoverGirl's stance comes after photoshopped versions of their NFL ads depicting battered women went viral over the weekend. While some have called for a boycott of the beauty brand, urging them to withdraw their sponsorship of the NFL, CoverGirl has made it clear that they will not yield to pressure. "CoverGirl believes that domestic violence is a serious issue that should never be ignored or trivialized. As an organization, we have always been committed to empowering women and ensuring that they have access to the resources they need to live a healthy, happy life," the company's statement read. The NFL has faced intense scrutiny in recent years over its handling of domestic violence cases involving its players. The Ray Rice scandal in 2014 sparked a national conversation about the issue, while the Adrian Peterson scandal in 2015 further fueled the controversy. In both cases, the league came under fire for failing to take a strong enough stance against domestic violence. Many have called on the NFL's corporate sponsors to take a stand against the league's handling of these cases. CoverGirl is one of several companies that has faced pressure from consumers to withdraw sponsorship from the NFL. While some companies, like Anheuser-Busch, have stated that they are monitoring the situation and could reconsider their sponsorship in the future, CoverGirl has made it clear that they are fully committed to the league. "We understand the concerns of those who are calling for a boycott of our products or who are urging us to withdraw our sponsorship of the NFL. But we believe that by standing with the league, we can help bring about positive change and contribute to a safer, healthier environment for all women," the statement continued. CoverGirl's decision to stick by the NFL has sparked mixed reactions on social media. Some users have praised the company for standing by its beliefs and supporting a cause that is important to them. Others, however, have criticized CoverGirl for not doing enough to combat domestic violence or for ignoring the concerns of their customers. This controversy highlights the ongoing debate about corporate responsibility and the role that brands should play in social issues. While companies like CoverGirl have made it clear that they stand by their values and beliefs, consumers have the power to hold them accountable and demand that they take action to address critical issues like domestic violence. In the final analysis, it is clear that CoverGirl will continue to support the NFL, and the league will continue to face scrutiny over its handling of domestic violence cases. The controversy over the company's stance will likely continue, with both supporters and detractors weighing in on the debate. However, one thing is certain: the issue of domestic violence will remain a critical concern that demands our attention and action.
