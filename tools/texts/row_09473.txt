Three senior BBC journalists have been accused of having a conflict of interest in accepting thousands of pounds to speak at conferences held by some of the organisations they are supposed to scrutinise. The Mail on Sunday has found that Radio 4 Today presenter Sarah Montague, economics editor Stephanie Flanders and Radio 5 Live chief political correspondent John Pienaar have agreed four and five-figure fees to officiate at events held by the NHS, the European Commission and the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, which represents accountants in Whitehall and local government.

Critics say this moonlighting could affect the trio’s ability to report impartially because they are receiving money from some of the institutions they cover. Last night, Tory MP Alun Cairns called for a register where BBC journalists would declare all outside earnings. He said: ‘Well-known journalists are often asked to attend these conferences for money. That potentially establishes an unhealthy relationship.’ BBC rules state that anyone signing up to a speaking agency must have written permission from their head of department and that each engagement is examined case by case.

Ms Montague is understood to have been paid five figures this month for chairing events at an NHS conference, while Ms Flanders, who according to agency JLA charges up to £25,000 per event, pulled out of a European Commission debate on June 19 after MoS enquiries. But both she and John Pienaar, a regular on the after-dinner circuit, are scheduled to appear at the CIPFA annual conference in July. A BBC spokesman denied any infringement of impartiality rules had taken place.

chatgpt: Senior BBC journalists have been found to be making thousands of pounds attending conferences. This has raised concerns about their outside earnings and led to calls for the creation of a register of these earnings. The call was made by Tory MP, Alun Cairns, who stated that such a register would ensure transparency and avoid conflicts of interest. According to Cairns, the BBC is a publicly funded organization, and as such, there need to be stricter measures in place to ensure that its employees are not engaging in activities that could compromise their journalistic integrity. Attending conferences and earning money from them is just one example of such activities. The current situation, Cairns argues, creates an impression of favoritism and selective reporting, especially when the conferences are attended by high-profile figures or parties with vested interests. While the BBC has a code of conduct to regulate staff conduct, Cairns says that it is not being applied strictly enough. BBC journalists attending conferences are typically paid for their attendance, with fees ranging from a few hundred pounds to several thousand pounds, depending on the prestige of the event. Some of the conferences that BBC journalists have been found to attend include those run by industry bodies, corporate conferences, and events organized by special interest groups. In response to the call for a register of outside earnings, the BBC has stated that it already has systems in place to ensure that its staff members do not engage in conflicts of interest. The organization also pointed out that it already has a code of conduct in place that regulates staff behavior. However, Cairns argues that more needs to be done to avoid any perception of wrongdoing. He has called on the BBC to be more transparent about its journalists' outside earnings and to create a public register of such earnings. In conclusion, the call for the creation of a register of BBC journalists' outside earnings has raised questions about the need for greater transparency in the organization. While the BBC says that it already has measures in place to avoid conflicts of interest, the call by Alun Cairns highlights concerns over the impartiality and integrity of the organization's journalism. It remains to be seen if the BBC will heed the call and create a public register of its journalists' outside earnings.
