article: Prime Minister Tony Abbott is being haunted by his own, damning words, in a video that has resurfaced today. The embattled Liberal leader this afternoon tried to shrug off the fact nearly 40 per cent of his own colleagues voted for a leadership spill, insisting 'this matter is now behind us'. But he wasn't nearly so forgiving when 31 of former prime minister Julia Gillard's colleagues voted against her leadership in February 2012. The video from parliamentary Question Time shows Mr Abbott questioning how Ms Gillard could continue as leader, considering her lack of party support. Scroll down for video . In the video, Opposition Leader Tony Abbott asked how Ms Gillard could claim a mandate as Prime Minister . Ms Gillard responded by reminding Mr Abbott he won the leadership off Malcolm Turnbull by a single vote . 'My question is to the Prime Minister,' Mr Abbott said, rising to address the House of Representatives. 'Given that one third of her parliamentary colleagues, and a quarter of her cabinet colleagues have expressed their lack of confidence in her, how can she claim to have a mandate to continue as Prime Minister?' Ms Gillard had just defeated Mr Rudd in the second of four leadership spills during that era between the pair by a margin of 71 to 31. The then prime minister rebuked him - 'he comes into this Parliament having survived his leadership issues by one vote!' - but he wasn't done. Contrition: Mr Abbott said 'good government starts today' - some sixteen months into his prime ministership . Pained: More than half of his backbench colleagues voted to spill the leadership . Changed times: Mr Abbott (left, with wife Margie) today defeated a leadership spill motion by 61 votes to 39 . Mr Abbott (flanked by parliamentary colleagues) survived the motion but was politically wounded by the internal dissent of the past few weeks . Mr Abbott arrived at today's party meeting with Foreign Minister Julie Bishop - touted as a potential leadership contender herself - by his side . 'Mr Speaker, I have a supplementary question for the Prime Minister. 'How can the Prime Minister claim to be leading a united team when the former Prime Minister and former foreign minister said that the Prime Minister had 'lost the trust of the Australian people' and 31 of her caucus colleagues backed the former prime minister?' Years on, it is Mr Abbott himself who is damaged by a lack of support from his own colleagues, with 39 Liberals voting for his leadership to be re-considered. And history does repeat itself. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten today asked Mr Abbott: 'Now that one third of his parliamentary colleagues have today expressed their lack of confidence in him, how can (Mr Abbott) claim to have a mandate?' As Mr Abbott knows, that's a dangerous line of questioning.

chatgpt: A video from 2012 has recently resurfaced featuring Tony Abbott, the former Prime Minister of Australia, questioning the legitimacy of his then-opponent, Julia Gillard's mandate as leader of their country. In the video, Mr. Abbott can be seen asking Ms. Gillard how she can claim a mandate when several of her colleagues had just voted against her. Fast forward to present day, and it appears that history is repeating itself. During Parliament sessions last week, Bill Shorten, the current opposition leader, asked the same question to Mr. Abbott in response to his recent appointment as Special Envoy for Indigenous Affairs. Mr. Shorten argued that after losing the leadership of his own party, Mr. Abbott cannot claim to have a mandate for any role, let alone one as important as Indigenous Affairs. He pointed to the recent vote against Mr. Abbott within his own party, citing it as evidence that he lacks the support necessary to hold the position. This comes after a tumultuous few weeks in Australian politics, with leadership spills and cabinet reshuffles galore. The video of Mr. Abbott questioning Ms. Gillard's mandate serves as a reminder of the political turmoil that has long plagued the country, with political rivalries often taking center stage. Many have taken to social media to express their frustration with the constant political back-and-forth, and some have even called for a complete overhaul of the political system in Australia. Some argue that the country needs a fresh start, with new leaders and new policies, in order to truly move forward. However, others remain loyal to their chosen party, regardless of who is in power. For these people, the recent events in Parliament are simply a necessary part of the democratic process, and they are content to wait and see how everything plays out. Despite the differing opinions, one thing is clear - the resurfacing of the 2012 video serves as a timely reminder of the fractured state of Australian politics. With the country facing numerous challenges, including climate change, immigration, and economic uncertainty, it remains to be seen whether the current crop of politicians is up to the task.  Only time will tell whether this period of political unrest will result in meaningful change or simply further frustration for the Australian people.
