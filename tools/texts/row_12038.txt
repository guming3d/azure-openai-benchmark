chatgpt: As tension continues to mount in New Delhi, mandatory frisking has been implemented for all passengers using the Delhi Metro network. Rapid response and bomb disposal teams are on standby. This announcement comes in the wake of a second warning from the Indian Mujahideen terrorist group of a possible hijacking attempt at the Delhi airport.  The Indian Mujahideen has been responsible for several attacks in the country since 2007. Their latest warning, announcing an attack within the first 10 days of 2014, has put the entire country on high alert. With foreign travelers at high risk of being targeted, they have been advised to comply with the demands of local authorities in case of any suspicious activity. This latest security threat has prompted authorities to take strict measures to keep the city safe. All passengers boarding the Delhi Metro network will undergo frisking, and their baggage will also be thoroughly checked. The security personnel at the airports and railway stations have been asked to be extra vigilant and to keep an eye out for suspicious activities. The rapid response teams, extensively trained in handling emergency situations, will be deployed at strategic locations across the city and will be the first to respond in case of any threat. The bomb disposal squads have also been stationed at various locations to deal with any suspicious packages or bombs. The Indian Mujahideen has been a serious threat to national security since its inception. The group is known for its violent attacks on civilian targets, and its members have been involved in several high-profile bombings in the country. The authorities have been on high alert since the group issued a warning of an attack within the first 10 days of 2014. Foreign travelers have been advised to comply with the instructions of local authorities at all times. The authorities have asked foreign nationals to be particularly vigilant and to report any suspicious activities or objects immediately. Security has been tightened at all major airports and railway stations across the country, with additional personnel and equipment being deployed. The Indian Mujahideen has been designated a terrorist organization by the United Nations, and the Indian government has been taking strong measures to eradicate the group. Its members have been arrested and convicted in several cases, but the group's activities have continued. The most significant of their recent attacks was the bombing of a popular bakery in Pune, which claimed 17 lives and injured several others. The Delhi Police and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) have been working closely to identify and neutralize any potential threats. The NIA has also been working with intelligence agencies to gather information regarding the group's plans and members. The recent security alert has understandably caused panic among the public, especially in New Delhi. The authorities have assured the public that all necessary measures have been taken to ensure their safety. They have urged people to be alert and to report any suspicious activities immediately. In conclusion, the recent security threat posed by the Indian Mujahideen has once again put the country on high alert. It is imperative that the authorities remain vigilant and take all necessary measures to prevent any potential attacks. The public must also cooperate with the authorities and report any suspicious activity. Ultimately, it is only by working together that we can ensure the safety of the people and the country.
