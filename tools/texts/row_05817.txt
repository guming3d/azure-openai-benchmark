article: Speaking out for the first time since nude pictures of her were leaked on the Internet, actress Scarlett Johansson defended the right to privacy, even for high-profile celebrities such as herself. Asking why protecting privacy is important is a redundant question, she told CNN's David McKenzie. "Who doesn't want to protect their own privacy?" she said. "Just because you're an actor or make films or whatever doesn't mean you're not entitled to your own personal privacy. If that is sieged in some way, it feels unjust. It feels wrong.' Johansson sat down for an interview with CNN in Nairobi, Kenya, following a visit with the humanitarian group Oxfam to see first-hand the impact of the drought and famine that has hit the Horn of Africa. Her trip came after hackers allegedly stole nude photos from Johansson's cell phone and posted them online earlier this month. The 26-year-old actress has never appeared fully nude in any of her films. She told CNN that she traveled to Kenya to highlight the depth of human suffering. The "Lost in Translation" and "Girl With a Pearl Earring" star has been an Oxfam ambassador since 2004. "What struck me the most is the fact that people are just surviving," she said. "They are in sort of a state of limbo." She said she was touched by the harrowing stories of many of the people she met at refugee camps, including a woman who was forced to leave her handicapped child behind in her search for food. She said the world was increasingly becoming a smaller place and urged people to get involved with helping others. "It feels just as wonderful to give as it does to receive," she said.

chatgpt: Actress and Oxfam ambassador, Emma Watson, recently became a victim of online hackers. The hackers allegedly managed to breach Watson's phone and steal private nude photos of the actress, which were subsequently posted online. In a statement, Watson expressed her deep regret that her privacy had been violated. "Who doesn't want to protect their own privacy?" she asked. "It's deeply upsetting that someone could steal my private photos and share them with the world without my consent." Watson was in Kenya at the time of the alleged breach, promoting Oxfam's work in the region. She is a vocal supporter of the charity's efforts to combat poverty and inequality around the world. The actress went on to express her concerns about the broader issue of online privacy. "This incident highlights the need for everyone to be vigilant about their online security," she said. "It's a reminder that even the most secure devices can be vulnerable to hacking." Watson has previously spoken out about her commitment to protecting her privacy. In 2014, she delivered a speech at the United Nations urging world leaders to take action to end gender-based violence and protect women's rights. The hacking incident has sparked a debate about the responsibility of tech companies to safeguard users' privacy. Many have called for stronger regulations and penalties to be put in place to deter hackers from committing such crimes. In the meantime, Watson is working with Oxfam to raise awareness about the importance of protecting personal information online. "I hope that my experience can help raise awareness about this issue," she said. "No one should have to suffer through a violation of their privacy like this."
