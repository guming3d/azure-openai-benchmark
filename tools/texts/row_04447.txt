article: Denise Shepherd, 19, who died from an overdose of heroin and a cocktail of pills after becoming addicted to drugs aged 11 . A teenage girl died from an overdose of heroin and a cocktail of pills after becoming addicted to drugs when she was aged just 11, an inquest has heard. Denise Shepherd started smoking cannabis before starting secondary school and then progressed to harder drugs such as heroin. In June last year, aged 19, she was found dead in the flat she shared with her boyfriend Jamie Hayne in Eastbourne, East Sussex, when he woke in the early hours of the morning and found she had stopped breathing. At an inquest into her death at Eastbourne Magistrate's Court, her mother Joann Bell told the coroner how her daughter had moved into her flat in a bid to get her to stop taking drugs but was later joined by Mr Hayne. The pair were said to be drinking heavily and were suspected of taking drugs. However, two days before Miss Shepherd, who was unemployed, was found dead, Ms Bell moved out of the flat. She said her daughter and Mr Hayne had a volatile relationship and didn't clean up after themselves. She said: 'They became increasingly difficult to live with. 'I struggled financially because they came to me for food.' She also told the hearing how her daughter had smoked cannabis from a very early age after she had 'fallen in with the wrong crowd'. Coronor Alan Craze was also told how a neighbour had tried to administer CPR to Miss Shepherd when she was discovered unconscious. When paramedics arrived they too were unable to revive her and it is feared she may have been dead for some time. Mr Craze then recorded a verdict of death due to a dependence on drugs. The inquest at Eastbourne Magistrates Court, pictured, saw Coroner Alan Craze record a verdict of death due to a dependence on drugs . Speaking after the inquest, Ms Bell said she has tried to warn her daughter about the dangers of drugs. She said: 'It is so difficult. People won’t talk to their parents about drugs. 'I tried to sit down and talk to her calmly but I never was aware exactly what was going on. 'I wouldn’t have moved out if I had known. 'She was gullible, naive and easily-led. 'She would be an aunty now. Her brother is now a father. She would have loved being an aunty.'

chatgpt: Denise Shepherd, a young woman from Eastbourne, died last year from an overdose of heroin and a cocktail of pills, according to the inquest into her death. She was found dead in the flat she shared with her boyfriend, who was also a drug user. The hearing revealed that Denise had become addicted to drugs at the age of 11, starting with marijuana before moving on to harder substances. Her mother, Joann Bell, told the inquest that her daughter had "fallen in with the wrong crowd." Despite attempts to steer her daughter away from drugs, Ms. Bell said Denise's addiction spiraled out of control until she was using heroin. Denise's boyfriend, who was also a drug user, told the inquest that he had tried to revive her after finding her unresponsive in their flat, but was unsuccessful. Coroner Alan Craze recorded a verdict of death due to a dependence on drugs, highlighting the dangers of drug addiction and the tragic consequences that can result. The inquest into Denise's death serves as a reminder of the ongoing drug crisis across the UK, particularly among young people. According to the Office for National Statistics, drug-related deaths in the UK have been steadily increasing over the last decade, with 4,393 recorded in 2019 alone. Drug addiction is a complex issue that often arises from a combination of factors, including peer pressure, trauma, and mental health problems. Effective interventions and support services are needed to address these underlying issues and prevent young people from falling into the same cycle of drug dependency that ultimately claimed Denise's life. Ms. Bell hopes that her daughter's story will serve as a cautionary tale to other young people about the dangers of drug use. She also called for better access to addiction treatment and support services to help those struggling with drug dependency. Denise's tragic death has left a deep impact on her family and friends, as well as the wider community. As the UK continues to grapple with the drug epidemic, it is critical to prioritize education, prevention, and treatment in order to reduce the number of lives lost to addiction.
