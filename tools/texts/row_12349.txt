chatgpt: Samir Nasri, the former French international footballer, celebrated his 27th birthday in Brazil during the World Cup in the company of his stunning girlfriend, Anara Atanes. The pair were pictured enjoying each other's company, but it was his absence from the French squad and Anara's tweet that grabbed the headlines. Didier Deschamps, the French national team manager, decided not to include Nasri in the squad for the World Cup. This decision came as a surprise to many football lovers, especially since Nasri had scored 7 goals for Manchester City in the Premier League that season. However, Deschamps had his reasons, which he kept to himself. Anara Atanes did not take Nasri's snub lightly and took to Twitter to express her frustration. "F*** France and f*** Deschamps!", she tweeted. This tweet created a media storm, and Atanes was heavily criticized for her foul language and lack of respect for the French national team. Deschamps was not willing to let Atanes' tweet go unpunished and decided to take matters to court. He filed a civil lawsuit against the model for her offensive words against him and the French national team. The matter is still pending in court. This incident was not the first time that Atanes had publicly criticized Deschamps for leaving Nasri out of the French squad. She had previously claimed that the manager had a personal vendetta against Nasri and was jealous of his fame and success. The controversy surrounding Nasri, his absence from the French squad, and Atanes' foul language and public outburst made headlines worldwide. While Nasri enjoyed his birthday celebrations, France progressed into the last 16 of the World Cup, and Deschamps' decision to exclude him was vindicated. It remains to be seen what the outcome of the civil lawsuit will be, but one thing is certain- Atanes' tweet will be remembered for a long time to come, and her reputation as a model and social media influencer has taken a hit.
