After the monumental ruling last month awarding unpaid wages to an intern who worked on the film Black Swan, two new lawsuits have sprung up against NBCUniversal from former interns. In a lawsuit filed July 3, two former interns of NBCUniversal are suing the media company for unpaid wages for their time spent as interns on two of the company's television shows. Jesse Moore worked as a booking department intern at MSNBC and Monet Eliastam worked as a production intern for Saturday Night Live. Unpaid: The new lawsuit is aimed at NBCUniversal by former interns from MSNBC and Saturday Night Live . The interns: Jesse Moore, left, worked as a booking intern for MSNBC, while Monet Eliastam worked as a production intern for Saturday Night Live . The lawsuit alleges that 'a key part of NBCUniversal's success are the hundreds of unpaid or underpaid interns who work for it as production assistants, researchers, and delivery-people, but receive no or very little compensation for their work.' Both Moore and Eliastam reported working for more than 10 hours a day sometimes, while the lawsuit also states that NBC 'did not provide academic or vocational training.' Their tasks as interns listed in the lawsuit - filing petty cash envelopes, fetching coffee, and booking travel - seem more like training for secretarial positions than jobs in production. If Moore and Eliastam win their lawsuit against NBC, it will mean that not just they are owed back payment - but everyone who was an intern within the state's statue of limitations. In New York, that means interns from the past six years. Both Moore and Eliastam are being represented by the employment law firm Outten & Golden, the same firm that represented Eric Glatt in his successful case against Fox Searchlight for his time spent as an accounting intern on Black Swan. The law firm: Outten & Golden has taken up the intern's plight before, having represented Black Swan intern Eric Glatt. Juno Turner, left, and Justin Swartz, right, will represent the two former interns in their upcoming case . Ross Eisenbrey, a specialist in labor and employment law, explainedÂ  why Outten & Golden keep taking up these cases even though there is little to be gained financially. Since these cases are dealing with unpaid minimum wages, the cases don't amount to much unless grouped together in class-action suits with numerous defendants. 'They are hoping that some of these suits will pay off, but I think that they're willing to take a chance and prosecute some of these without a big payoff at the end,' Eisenbrey told Bloomberg Businessweek. 'The way to stop this practice is to bring big suits and win.'
highlights: Jesse Moore worked as a booking intern for MSNBC and Monet Eliastam worked as a production intern for Saturday Night Live . They are represented by the same firm that successfully won the case for former Black Swan intern, Eric Glatt . If they win, the past six years of unpaid interns at NBCUniversal could get paid for their time .

chatgpt: Two former NBCUniversal interns are taking legal action against the media giant, and their case could pave the way for many others to receive back pay for their unpaid internships. Jesse Moore worked as a booking intern for MSNBC, while Monet Eliastam was a production intern for Saturday Night Live. Both argue that they were not adequately compensated for the work they performed during their internships. Moore and Eliastam are represented by the same law firm that successfully represented former Black Swan intern Eric Glatt, whose case set a precedent for intern rights in the entertainment industry. The firm argues that NBCUniversal's internship program violated state and federal labor laws by not providing interns with proper training and mentoring, and by failing to pay them for the work they performed. If the two interns are successful in their case, it could have major implications for the past six years of unpaid interns at NBCUniversal. Legal experts estimate that back pay and damages could exceed $200 million. The lawsuit comes as more and more former unpaid interns are taking legal action against their former employers, hoping to receive compensation for work they performed but were not paid for. NBCUniversal has not yet commented on the lawsuit, but the company has already faced criticism for its unpaid internship program. Some experts argue that unpaid internships are exploitative and unfair to young people, while others argue that they provide valuable opportunities to gain experience and make connections in a competitive industry. Critics of unpaid internships say that they disproportionately benefit wealthy students, who can afford to work for free, while creating a barrier to entry for low-income students and other underprivileged groups. They argue that unpaid internships reinforce social inequality and contribute to a culture of unpaid labor in many industries. Advocates of unpaid internships, on the other hand, say that they provide valuable experience and networking opportunities that can help young professionals launch successful careers. They argue that unpaid internships are a necessary part of the job market, and that they are a fair exchange for the experience and training they provide. Regardless of where one stands on the issue, it is clear that unpaid internships are coming under increasing scrutiny. With lawsuits like this one, and growing awareness of intern rights, employers will need to reexamine their internship programs and ensure that they are providing valuable opportunities without exploiting young talent.
