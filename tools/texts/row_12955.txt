article: (CNN) -- A man coolly and calmly approached the screening area outside the Pentagon Thursday evening and opened fire, grazing two Pentagon police officers before they returned fire, critically wounding him, officials said. The incident happened at 6:40 p.m., when the man wearing a coat -- with "no real emotion in his face" -- approached the officers outside the Pentagon Metro station, said Pentagon Police Chief Richard S. Keevill. "As the officers started to ask him for his pass to get into the Pentagon, he drew a weapon from his pocket and started shooting immediately at the officers" from a few feet away, Keevill told reporters. "He drew a gun and just started shooting immediately." The two Pentagon Force Protection Agency officers returned fire with their semi-automatic Glock .40-caliber weapons and the suspect, thought to be a U.S. citizen, was critically wounded, Keevill said. He praised the police officers for acting "quickly and decisively to neutralize him as a threat" without hurting anyone else. Asked how many shots were fired, he said, "Many." Keevill would not identify the man. The Pentagon Force Protection Agency is the Pentagon's police department. Pentagon entrances were locked briefly but all were reopened with the exception of the Pentagon Metro entrance, the Pentagon said in a statement. Lisa McDonald, a spokeswoman for George Washington Hospital, said three people were being treated there -- both officers and the suspect. The Pentagon police department, the Arlington County Police Department, U.S. Secret Service and the FBI were all involved in the investigation, Keevill said. The Pentagon is one of the largest office buildings in the world with three times the floor space of New York's Empire State Building, according to its official Web site. Some 23,000 military and civilian employees work there. Are you there? Send images, video .

chatgpt: In a shocking incident, a suspect opened fire at the screening area of the Pentagon, injuring multiple people. According to the police, the incident took place earlier today when the suspect, whose identity is yet to be revealed, shot at the officers. However, the officers were able to return fire and injure the suspect, who is now in custody. The Pentagon police have confirmed that three people, including two bystanders, were injured in the shooting and have been taken to George Washington Hospital. The hospital has not yet released a statement regarding the condition of the patients. However, sources close to the investigation claim that all three injured are stable and expected to recover. Following the incident, the screening area of the Pentagon has been locked down, and no one is being allowed to enter or leave the premises. The police and security personnel are conducting a thorough investigation into the matter, and the area has been cordoned off. The police have also confirmed that there is no immediate threat to the public at this time. The Pentagon, which is the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense, is one of the most secure areas in the country. It is monitored 24/7 by CCTV cameras and has several layers of security that one must pass through before entering the premises. However, despite the security measures in place, incidents like these are a reminder that no place is entirely safe from violence. The motive behind the attack is not yet clear, and the police have not revealed any details about the suspect, apart from confirming that they are in custody. In a statement to the media, the Pentagon police chief said that they are investigating all possible leads and will keep the public updated on any developments. The incident has sent shockwaves across the country, and senior officials have condemned the attack. The Pentagon is a symbol of the strength of the United States, and any attack on the institution is an attack on the country itself. The investigation is still ongoing, and more details are expected to emerge in the coming hours and days.
