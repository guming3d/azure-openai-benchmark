article: Cindy Crawford's 13-year-old daughter Kaia Gerber looks like an angel modeling a pair of wings on Instagram. The image was taken by Kaia's older brother Presley, 15, and shared on the siblings' shared Instagram account earlier today. And despite her young age, fans were quick to comment how mature the teenage model appeared - with many of them suggesting that she could easily hold her own among some of Victoria's Secret's most experienced Angels. Scroll down for video . Angel in training: Kaia Gerber, 13, posted an image of herself sporting a pair of feathered wings on Instagram . Seeing double: The teenager is the spitting image of her supermodel mother Cindy Crawford (L) 'Better than a VS Angel,' one Instagram user commented, while another added: 'The soon to be Victoria's Secret Angel.' Kaia, who is the daughter of Cindy and her husband of 16 years Rande Gerber, made her fashion big fashion debut aged 10, when she appeared in the first ever Young Versace ad. The similarities in appearance between the youngster and her supermodel mother, now 48, quickly caught the attention of the industry's elite, many of whom were quick to label the youngster as one to watch for the future. At the time however, former Vogue cover star Cindy insisted her daughter would have to wait a while before throwing herself into a full-time fashion career. 'At this point, she’s too young to pursue a career,' she told The Daily Front Row. 'There aren’t even a handful of jobs for a 10-year-old girl. But if she’s 17 and wants to try it... of course, what can I say? She’s really into singing and acting. Model genes: While Kaia (R) has insisted she doesn't look anything like her mother (L), the similarities between the pair are incredibly obvious to most . 'She kind of jokingly said - I’m not even sure if it was jokingly - "I might model first because you don’t have to know how to do anything, but then I want to be a baby nurse."' But it seems that Cindy has since changed her mind - and is now happily encouraging her daughter's burgeoning career as a professional model. Earlier this month, the teen made her magazine debut on the cover of Teen Vogue, a move which Cindy admits she was 100 per cent in favor of. 'I’m happy for her to be happy,' she told the UK's Evening Standard. 'She’s kind of chomping at the bit and the Teen Vogue piece seemed like an appropriate thing to do. 'I am very comfortable with the photographer, who is a woman I’ve worked with a lot and is a mother herself.'

chatgpt: In the world of fashion, social media has become a breeding ground for young models looking to make an impact. And one such model is 16-year-old Primrose, who has recently made waves on Instagram with her stunning features and striking poses. Primrose's latest photo, which has taken social media by storm, was captured by none other than her older brother, Presley. The 19-year-old's photo shows his younger sister posing confidently in a white t-shirt and denim shorts, looking straight into the camera with a fierce gaze. The siblings, who share the same Instagram account, regularly post photos and updates about their daily lives. However, this particular photo has garnered a lot of attention, with many praising Primrose's natural beauty and modeling talent. Speaking to reporters, Presley shared his excitement at seeing his sister gain recognition for her modeling endeavors. "I've always known that Prim was destined for greatness, and it's amazing to see her receive recognition for her hard work and dedication," he said. "I'm so proud of her, and I can't wait to see where her career takes her." But while the photo has received widespread praise and admiration, critics have been quick to point out the potential dangers of a young girl entering the modeling world at such a young age. With body image issues and self-esteem concerns rampant in the fashion industry, many worry that Primrose may be subject to unrealistic beauty standards and unfair scrutiny. However, the siblings are quick to dismiss these concerns, and emphasize the importance of having a supportive family unit. "We're very close as a family, and we make it a priority to support each other no matter what," said Primrose. "I know that Presley always has my back, and that means a lot to me." Their mother, who also plays a key role in managing Primrose's modeling career, echoes this sentiment, stating that she is committed to keeping her daughter grounded and positive. "I believe that with the right guidance and support, Primrose can thrive in the modeling industry without compromising her values," she said. Despite the challenges that come with being a young model in the digital age, Primrose is determined to make a name for herself on her own terms. "I want to inspire other young people to pursue their dreams and never give up, no matter what obstacles they may face," she said. With her striking features and undeniable talent, it's clear that Primrose is well on her way to achieving her goals. And with the help of her supportive family, there's no telling what she can accomplish in the world of fashion.
