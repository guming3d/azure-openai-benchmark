As it stands, US technology lovers can only take their instructions from a woman while those in the UK are given directions by a man's voice. But all that is about to change. Apple unveiled earlier this week that its latest software update for the iPhone will see users able to choose whether the phone's built-in personal assistant Siri speaks with a male or female voice. For the first time, users of the phone will have a choice which sex Siri takes the form of when it tells them where the nearest takeaway is or puts an appointment in your mobile schedule. New technology: Apple software developers unveiled the latest updates for its IOS software for the iPhone earlier this week . And according to Clifford Nass, a professor at Stanford University in the US, research has shown that iPhone fans may trust male Siri's answers more than those that come from his female counterpart. Nass, who studies people's interaction with technology, said: 'Female voices are seen, on average, as less intelligent than male voices. 'It’s safer in a sense to have a male voice in the sense that you’re not going to disappoint people as much.' The new option offers users another opportunity to customise their phones, similar to options that allow users to customise their ringtones or chose an individual picture as their screen background. The male voice which will be introduced for the first time to US users will already seem familiar to them as it is used on the Apple Support hotline and the United Airlines hotline, according to the Huffington Post. New look: Apple unveiled a new user interface for its iPhone earlier this week . The original creators of the technology behind Siri, which was snapped up first by Apple, are said to have envisaged multiple Siri characters and wanted to install technology that would see the iPhone mimic it's user way of talking. But Nass said that Apple risks alienating customers by offering a choice of male or female Siri. He told the Huffington Post that men and women tend to use different dialect as well as sounding different. He said that unless the software sees separate dialects recorded for the male and female Siris then users won't trust the interface. Leila Takayama, a research scientist at Willow Garage, a robotics firm, said that having a choice of voices may lead users to see Siri as more of a technology than a personality. Experts claimed when Siri was initially launched that dominant gender stereotypes in different nations dictated whether a male or female voice was used.

chatgpt: Apple has made a significant alteration to Siri, its digital assistant, with the latest software update. For many years now, iPhone users in the United States could only interact with a female-voiced AI assistant. Meanwhile, UK customers had the choice of a male Siri. However, with the newest software update, Siri’s default voice in the US has changed from female to gender-neutral. The update was announced by Apple during its annual developer conference, which took place earlier this week. The change comes after criticism from some users, who claimed that Siri’s female voice perpetuated stereotypes and biases. Apple is hopeful that the gender-neutral voice will make Siri more inclusive and reflective of its diverse user base. In a statement, the company said: "We're excited to introduce a new Siri voice, which we believe will provide users with a more diverse Siri experience." Siri's new voice was developed with recordings from new voice talent, and they used an engineering approach called speech synthesis to incorporate a wide range of voices for the AI digital assistant. The updated version retains Siri’s signature sound, but it will possess a much wider pitch range, allowing for a more varied performance. The move comes after years of criticism that Siri's female voice perpetuates gender stereotypes, with users believing that society challenges women's authority by making them communicate in a certain way. Several studies have suggested that women's voices are often preferred in the digital assistant industry because they are perceived to be more helpful and friendly. As a result, some argue that virtual assistants with female voices are often overworked, whether they're helping schedule appointments or answering complex queries. This shift to a gender-neutral Siri is one of several Apple updates meant to promote inclusivity and diversity. The business recently introduced new features to its iMessage program, including a Memoji editor that allows users to personalise their Memoji avatars with masks, glasses, new hairstyles, and other accessories. The software update, labeled iOS 14.5, has been made available to iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch customers worldwide. In addition to changes made to Siri, the update also contains new privacy features, including the ability to enter Siri requests without connecting to the internet. In conclusion, the innovative Siri update demonstrates Apple's commitment to improving diversity, inclusion, and equity, and the company believes that this shift will lead to a more inclusive Siri experience. It also highlights the importance of reducing gender stereotypes, particularly in the tech industry, where ongoing efforts to reduce gender disparities are crucial.
