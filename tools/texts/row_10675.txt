article: Garry Hancock (pictured with the packet of mushrooms) complained to Walsh Mushrooms after his wife found a cigarette in the packet . A father-of-four was left disgusted after his wife discovered a cigarette inside a packet of mushrooms. Garry Hanock, 36, said his wife Alexandra, 36, had been preparing dinner for their four sons when she spotted the unsmoked cigarette in the packet of mushrooms. When Mr Hancock, from Peasedown St John, near Bath, Somerset, complained to the company who supplied the mushrooms he received a cheque for 92p reimbursing him and an offer of a factory visit. He said: 'Whether the cigarette was put in the mushrooms on purpose by some disgruntled member of staff or whether it was an accident weâ€™ll never know but packets should be checked much more carefully before they end up on the shelves. 'I was shocked with the response of the company who supplied the mushrooms. 'They sent me a cheque for 92p which was how much the mushrooms cost and invited me to visit the factory where the mushrooms are packed. 'I have to say I rang them up and suggested they would be better off inviting someone from the Food Standards Agency to look around instead of me.' Mr Hancock, a printer, bought the packet of British mushrooms from a Co-operative shop in Radstock, Somerset, on January 14. The mushrooms were supplied to the store from Walsh Mushrooms in Evesham, Worcestershire. Brian Cartwright, sales and marketing director, said it was the first such incident in the 35 years the company has been in business. He said: 'The packet was harvested in Northern Ireland at one of our growers. The mushrooms were supplied to the Co-operative store by Walsh Mushrooms in Evesham, Worcestershire . 'We have very strict rules and regulations about taking anything into the work place, let alone cigarettes. 'We have followed that through with the site and the site operator has had all his people together and let them know this has been found and reminded them that people could lose their jobs if they break the rules about bringing items into the work place. 'If anyone was found to have done this they would be prosecuted. 'We are very disappointed that he (Mr Hancock) has turned down our offers.'

chatgpt: A man from Somerset, Garry Hancock, was shocked to find a cigarette in a pack of mushrooms he had purchased from his local Co-operative store. He reported the issue to the store and was given a cheque for just 92p as compensation, which he felt was insufficient. Mr. Hancock said that his wife was the first to discover the cigarette in the pack of mushrooms. He immediately informed the store where he had purchased the mushrooms from and complained about the matter. The store manager offered him a factory visit and also gave him a cheque for 92 pence. Mr. Hancock was unimpressed with the response and felt that the compensation was inadequate. He further expressed his disappointment, as this was not the first time he had experienced a problem with the quality of the supermarket's products. The Co-operative has issued a statement apologizing for the incident and stating that they have launched an investigation into the matter. They have also offered to refund Mr. Hancock's money and have assured him that they are taking steps to ensure that such incidents do not occur in the future. Mr. Hancock is not convinced that the Co-operative has done enough to resolve the issue. He feels that the compensation offered is a sign of disrespect and disregard towards the customer. He is also concerned about the safety of the Co-operative's products and is calling for an overhaul in the supermarket's quality control practices. In response to Mr. Hancock's concerns, the Co-operative has stated that they take the quality and safety of their products very seriously, and that they follow strict guidelines and protocols to ensure that their products meet the highest standards. They have also stated that they are committed to making any necessary improvements to their quality control practices. In conclusion, while Mr. Hancock's experience may be concerning, it is clear that the Co-operative is taking the issue seriously and is committed to addressing any shortcomings. It is also important to note that incidents like these are rare, and that the supermarket industry as a whole has strict regulations and guidelines in place to ensure the safety and quality of their products.
