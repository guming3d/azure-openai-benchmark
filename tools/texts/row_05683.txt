article: A drunk Briton who threatened to kill an air stewardess and chop her up after she refused to serve him more alcohol is to have his mental health assessed. The 42-year-old, named only as A M, was eating food off the floor of an Emirates flight from London to Dubai when he started to throw his meal at other passengers and verbally abuse the staff. Dubai Criminal Court has ordered a medical committee to examine the man after his outburst on the flight in June during which he told a female flight attendant that she was a 'sex slave'. A British man who threatened to kill an Emirates air stewardess and chop her up after she refused to serve him more alcohol is to have his mental health assessed . The defendant began drinking shortly before take-off and continued 20 minutes into the journey, the court heard. Indian flight attendant, 30, known only as B S, said: 'He was eating and throwing away food on the floor, then eating off the floor. 'I went to him and asked him to return to his seat and have his meal there. I then brought a garbage bag and started picking up the food he threw away. 'He also threw food on passengers around him and jumped from his seat to the aisle and started making a mess. Some passengers asked to change seats from near him.' A Dubai court was told that the threat was made by the 40-year-old, named only as A M, amid several outbursts of verbal abuse directed at cabin staff and unseemly behaviour that included throwing food at other passengers . As she cleaned up after him, B S said the defendant aggressively pulled her shirt. When she asked him to stop touching her, he got up from his seat and began a torrent of insults. 'He stood up and told me I was trash, a sex slave and a b****,' she said, adding that the Briton also insulted some of her colleagues. He then threatened to slap B S, kill her and chop her up if she did not give him more alcohol. Fellow flight attendant, E M, 26, from Egypt said: 'I was ordered to attend to the problem and, when I did, I saw him jumping on his seat and pulling B S from her shirt, then insulting her with very bad words.' He proceeded to the toilet where he lit a cigarette, setting off the fire alarm and scaring his fellow passengers, the court heard. The unruly passenger fell asleep shortly before the plane landed in Dubai, and then started to also insult the waiting police, court records showed. He denied all the charges against him, including one of illegal consumption of alcohol. The court was due to issue a verdict on Wednesday morning but instead ordered the mental health check.

chatgpt: A British man has been accused of threatening to kill an Emirates air stewardess on a flight from London to Dubai. The 42-year-old reportedly exhibited ugly behavior towards the flight attendants after he was refused alcohol. According to reports, the man was eating food off the floor and verbally abusing the staff before he pulled a female flight attendant's shirt and called her a "sex slave." The incident took place on a flight operated by Emirates, which is the flagship airline of the United Arab Emirates. The man's behavior was so appalling that the Emirates staff informed the authorities in Dubai after the flight landed. The Dubai Criminal Court has now ordered a medical committee to examine the man's behavior and determine whether he was under the influence of any substances at the time of the incident. The defendant appeared in court dressed in traditional Arab attire, looking visibly confused and disoriented. However, he told the court that he did not remember the incident and had no recollection of what he said to the Emirates staff. The court was also told that the defendant had a history of alcoholism and had been attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings before he boarded the flight in London. However, he was refused alcohol on the Emirates flight, which seems to have triggered his aggressive behavior. The incident has raised concerns about the behavior of some passengers on flights, particularly when it comes to alcohol consumption. Emirates is one of the world's leading airlines, and it takes the safety and well-being of its passengers and staff very seriously. In a statement, Emirates said that it fully cooperated with the authorities in Dubai and will continue to support the legal process. The airline also reiterated its commitment to providing a safe and enjoyable travel experience for its passengers. The incident comes amid a global debate about the safety of commercial airlines, particularly in light of recent incidents involving unruly passengers. In August, a passenger on a Delta Airlines flight was duct-taped to his seat after he assaulted a flight attendant and tried to open the plane's door mid-air. The Emirates incident serves as a reminder that airline staff are not only responsible for the safety of passengers, but also for dealing with unruly behavior. It is essential that passengers respect the rules and regulations of their airline and behave in a manner that is respectful to their fellow passengers and crew members. In conclusion, the Emirates air stewardess incident is a stark reminder of the importance of respecting airline staff and following the rules and regulations of an airline. The defendant's behavior was unacceptable and must be condemned. It remains to be seen what the outcome of the court's investigation will be, but it is clear that the Emirates airline will continue to take all necessary measures to ensure the safety and well-being of its passengers and staff.
