article: Last week, Theresa May was pictured sporting sassy knee-high boots and a rather eye-catching coat that could hardly be described as conservative. The Home Secretary took further sartorial steps at her party's conference earlier this month where she turned heads in a Â£1,190 Vivienne Westwood tartan suit, leading to comparisons being drawn between her and Cara Delevingne, who wore the exact same look a few months earlier. But the 57-year-old MP has laughed off similarities between herself and the 21-year-old supermodel, who she describes as one of the most 'beautiful' women in the world. Sole mates: Theresa May may have been pictured last week in a pair of racy boots just like some sported by Cara Delevingne, but the MP says she definitely doesn't share the model's style . Speaking as she collected the Spectator's Politician of the Year award last week, the 57-year-old said: 'This is the second good thing that's happened to me today because this morning, the Daily Mail asked: "Is Theresa May the new Cara Delevingne?" 'For . those of you who don't know, she is 21, a supermodel and one of the . most beautiful in the world - so I think we can safely say that the . answer to that has to be filed by John Rentoul as a question, to which . the answer is no.' While May is hugely flattered by the comparisons, she's made it quite clear that she won't be hanging out with Miley Cyrus in a beanie or a cropped top anytime soon.

chatgpt: In a recent interview, 57-year-old MP Kathy Johnson revealed that she does not share supermodel Cara's sense of style. Despite this, Kathy went on to declare Cara "one of the most beautiful supermodels in the world." Kathy, a prominent figure in the political world, is known for her conservative fashion choices. She has never been one to follow the latest fashion trends and instead tends to opt for classic pieces that stand the test of time. When asked about Cara's bold and daring fashion choices, Kathy replied, "It's not really my cup of tea." However, Kathy was quick to heap praise on the iconic model. She commended Cara's beauty and called her one of the most beautiful supermodels in the world. This admiration may come as a surprise to some, given the stark contrast in their styles. Cara, known for her striking looks and edgy fashion choices, has made a name for herself in the fashion industry. She is a frequent presence on runways, red carpets, and social media feeds alike. Her signature look is often characterized by bold makeup, statement accessories, and unique outfits that push the boundaries of conventional style. Despite their differing styles, both women have found success in their respective fields. Kathy, a respected political figure, has made a name for herself through her advocacy work and policy initiatives. Cara, on the other hand, has become a household name in the fashion industry and has used her platform to advocate for causes such as mental health awareness and LGBTQ rights. In an age where public figures are often criticized for their fashion choices, it's refreshing to see Kathy and Cara embrace their own unique styles. Both women have found success by staying true to themselves and refusing to conform to anyone else's expectations. As for the rest of us, it's a reminder to embrace our own individuality and not be afraid to express ourselves through our fashion choices. Whether we prefer classic pieces like Kathy or bold looks like Cara, the key is to stay true to ourselves and wear what makes us feel confident and empowered. In conclusion, while Kathy may not share Cara's sense of style, she certainly has an appreciation for her beauty and talent. This unlikely pairing is a reminder that we can all find common ground, regardless of our differences. And who knows, maybe we'll see Kathy rocking a bold accessory or two in the future.
