An unholy row has erupted in the US after an independent clothing label discovered that 'Jesus' has been registered as a trademark. When Michael Julius Anton, from Virginia, wanted to patent his company Jesus Surfed he found that an Italian jeans label had already beaten him to it. Jesus Jeans was registered with the US Patent and Trademark office in 2007 and lawyers have told Mr Anton he cannot trade commercially using his chosen name, The Wall Street Journal reported. Italian clothing company Jesus Jeans won the exclusive right to use of the name 'Jesus' for clothing brands in the US in 2007 . The company does not have a patent on images of Jesus - just his name. Jesus Jeans has reportedly warned dozens other apparel start ups in the US against using Jesus in their brand since winning the patent. Others to have been warned include 'Jesus First', 'Sweet Jesus' and 'Jesus Couture'. Intellectual property lawyers say there is nothing against companies owning century-old names. 'If somebody—small church or even a big church—wants to use 'Jesus' for printing a few T-shirts, we don't care,' said Domenico Sindico  the general counsel for intellectual property at BasicNet, a publicly traded company based in Turin, Italy, that owns Jesus Jeans and the Kappa sportswear brand. But when companies like Jesus Surfed want to make money from their products, 'that's a concern,' he said. Lawyers have warned Mr Anton he can only use the name Jesus in 'descriptive, religious, free speech, ornamental sense' and that he should withdraw his trademark application. Mr Anton was sent a legal warning after he tried to register a patent for his clothing company Jesus Surfed . The owner of Jesus Jeans, Maurizio Vitale, came up with the name during a visit to New York when he walked by a theatre poster for the musical 'Jesus Christ Superstar'. BasicNet acquired Jesus Jeans in the 1990s through a bankruptcy but their attempts to trademark 'Jesus' have been turned down in countries including Turkey, China, Switzerland, Australia, Norway and Cuba. In 2003, Britain's patent office rejected its application as 'morally offensive to the public' but Jesus Jeans registered 'Jesus' through the European Union as a 'Community Trademark' valid across the European Union. Mr Anton said he is preparing to fight his case. 'Jesus Jeans has absolutely nothing to do with anything biblical,' he said. 'I didn't think it would be that big of a hassle.'

chatgpt: Italian clothing company Jesus Jeans is currently facing a patent battle over the use of the name "Jesus" in clothing. The company, which specializes in denim apparel, claims to own the US patent to the name and has already warned several other brands not to use it in their clothing lines. However, Michael Anton of Virginia is contesting their right to own the patent, stating that the name "Jesus" has nothing to do with the company's biblical namesake. According to reports, Jesus Jeans has been sending cease and desist letters to various clothing companies that use "Jesus" in their branding. Some of these companies include "Jesus Surfed" and "Jesus Couture," which Jesus Jeans claims are infringing on their patent. The Italian company has also reportedly filed a lawsuit against a clothing company in Tennessee that markets clothing under the name "Jesus by Jesus." Despite these actions, Michael Anton has decided to challenge Jesus Jeans' patent ownership. In a statement to the media, Anton argued that "Jesus Jeans has absolutely nothing to do with anything biblical." He further pointed out that the word "Jesus" has been used in many different contexts, and it is not fair for one company to claim ownership over it. Anton's challenge is not the first time Jesus Jeans has faced opposition over their use of the name. In 2013, a Chilean artist filed a lawsuit against the company for using the name "Jesus" in their branding. The lawsuit argued that Jesus Jeans was exploiting the religious connotations of the name for commercial gain. Despite these challenges, Jesus Jeans has continued to defend their right to the patent. The company claims that they have been using the name "Jesus" in their branding since the 1970s and that they are simply protecting their intellectual property. The outcome of the current lawsuit remains uncertain, but it has sparked a larger discussion about the use of religious names in branding. Some argue that it is inappropriate to use religious figures for commercial gain, while others claim that it is simply a matter of intellectual property rights. Regardless of the eventual outcome, it is clear that the battle over the "Jesus" patent is far from over. As more and more clothing companies enter the market, the issue of using religious names is likely to remain a contentious one.
