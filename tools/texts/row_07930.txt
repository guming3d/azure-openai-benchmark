chatgpt: Arsenal's victory against West Bromwich Albion was marred with injuries to three key players, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Nacho Monreal and Kieran Gibbs. The Gunners, who already have 10 first-team players out, secured a 1-0 win at The Hawthorns, thanks to Danny Welbeck's header. Arsenal manager, Arsene Wenger, was elated with the win but expressed his concern about the mounting injury list. "We have to wait and see how bad the injuries are, but it's not looking good," said Wenger. He also praised the players for their resilience, stating that it was a difficult game but the team 'did well to hold on for the win'. The Gunners, who are currently fifth in the Premier League table, have been plagued with injuries throughout the season. The likes of Aaron Ramsey, Santi Cazorla, and Francis Coquelin have been ruled out for the most part of the season, leaving Wenger with a depleted squad. However, the North London club managed to grind out a crucial win against Tony Pulis' men, who were looking to bounce back from their recent defeat to Manchester United. Arsenal started the game on the front foot, with Mesut Ozil and Welbeck coming close to breaking the deadlock in the opening minutes. However, they were met with a resolute West Brom defence, who were determined to keep the Gunners at bay. The home side, who were missing the services of the influential Matt Phillips, struggled to break down the Arsenal defence throughout the game. Arsenal goalkeeper, Petr Cech, was forced into a few saves but largely untroubled by the West Brom attack. The only goal of the game came in the 60th minute, when Welbeck rose highest to meet an Ozil cross and head home. The goal was Welbeck's fourth of the season and came at a crucial time for the Gunners. Despite the win, Wenger was faced with more injury concerns to add to his already long list. Oxlade-Chamberlain was forced off with a hamstring injury, while Monreal and Gibbs suffered ankle injuries. Wenger, who was already without first-choice full-backs Hector Bellerin and Sead Kolasinac, will be hoping the injuries are not too serious, with a busy festive period coming up. The Arsenal boss will also be pleased with the performance of Ozil, who was instrumental in the Gunners' win. The German playmaker's assist for Welbeck's goal was his ninth of the season, and he was constantly causing problems for the West Brom defence. The win sees Arsenal move level on points with fourth-placed Liverpool, who take on Bournemouth later today. The Gunners will be hoping to build on the win and mount a serious challenge for a top-four spot in the second half of the season. However, they will need to address their injury woes if they are to maintain their push for the Champions League places.
