article: For the first time, the number of active daily visitors checking Facebook on mobile devices is higher than the number of people checking the social network on the Web. Overall, the company says there are 1.06 billion active Facebook users in the world. Of those, 618 million of them are visiting daily and 157 million are doing it from mobile devices. The company's focus on putting mobile first, with new apps and features, is paying off. Facebook is the largest social network in the world, and it was the most-used mobile app across iOS and Android devices in the United States in 2012, according to recent comScore numbers. "In 2012, we connected over a billion people and became a mobile company," said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a statement announcing the fourth-quarter results. This is great news for the company, which is figuring out the best way to make money off all those smartphone and tablet users. Its biggest earner is advertising, which makes up 84% of the company's revenue. The big story this quarter is mobile ads, which the company said accounted for 23% of its ad revenue, a huge leap from the third quarter of last year when it was just 14%. Big companies like Wal-Mart are tapping into Facebook's audience. The retailer served up 50 million mobile ads in the fourth quarter. Facebook also makes some money off social games like Zynga's "FarmVille," which share revenue with the social network. But the company is hoping to move beyond Zynga's games to become the default platform for mobile games from all developers. The company is constantly testing new ways to squeeze cash out of users and partners, with a steady stream of features and ads. Recent smaller projects that are still finding their legs include Facebook Gifts, which lets you buy real and virtual goods for friends, and charging a small fee to send messages to strangers. While ads and visits are taking off on mobile devices, the company's latest big feature is still Web-only. Graph Search, a new advanced search feature that lets you scour your extended network for people based on their likes or profiles, is still in its beta stages and cannot be accessed through mobile apps. Currently the search feature doesn't make money, but Zuckerberg said it could become a meaningful business "down the line."

chatgpt: Facebook announced its latest earnings on Wednesday and there is good news for the social networking giant. For the first time in history, there are now more people using Facebook on mobile devices than there are people checking the website on the Web. This is a major milestone for the company, as mobile usage continues to increase around the world. Facebook has been working hard to improve its mobile experience for users, and it seems to be paying off. Its mobile app is now one of the most popular apps in the world, with millions of people using it every day to check their friends' updates, share photos and connect with the world around them. The company is also getting better at making money off of mobile, with a boom in mobile ads. In the last quarter, Facebook's mobile ad revenue soared, accounting for nearly 92% of the company's total advertising revenue. This is a significant increase compared to last year, when mobile ads accounted for just over 50% of Facebook's advertising revenue. The strong performance of Facebook's mobile advertising business has been driven by two main factors: the growing number of people using the social network on their mobile devices, and the continued success of Facebook's ad products. The company has developed a range of mobile ad formats, such as Sponsored Stories and News Feed ads, that are highly effective at reaching and engaging users. Facebook's success in the mobile advertising market is great news for the company, as it faces fierce competition from rivals such as Google and Twitter. These companies have also been investing heavily in mobile advertising, and are looking to grab a bigger share of the market. However, Facebook's dominance in the social networking sector, along with its focus on innovation and user engagement, has put it in a strong position to defend its market share. Facebook's latest earnings report shows that the company is firing on all cylinders, with strong growth in both its user base and its advertising business. With more than 2 billion active users around the world, Facebook continues to be the world's largest social network, and its success in mobile is only adding to its strength. As the company continues to develop new products and services, it is well positioned to stay at the forefront of the digital revolution.
