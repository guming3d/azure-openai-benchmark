Hot spot: Gaudi's Sagrada Familia is an imposing sight, which more than three million tourists visit each year . Neighbour Mireia Daniel, 40, added: 'The last few years have been terrible. I can't even take my son to his nursery in a pushchair.' The number of tourists visiting Barcelona has more than tripled in the last 20 years. More than three million people visit the Sagrada Familia, a large Roman Catholic church and Unesco World Heritage site designed by Catalan architect Antoni Gaudi, every year.

chatgpt: The beautiful city of Barcelona has seen a drastic increase in the number of tourists visiting the city over the last two decades. In the last 20 years alone, the number of visitors has more than tripled in Barcelona. However, with the surge in tourism, the city has also been grappling with the challenges that accompany it. Recently, the city witnessed protests against the behaviour of drunken holidaymakers and illegal tourist flats. Concerns were raised about the negative impact on the city's environment and its residential communities. The local residents were concerned about the influx of large numbers of tourists, overcrowding, and increase in noise levels. The locals' anger came to the forefront when tourists were spotted coming out of a supermarket naked. This incident sparked a wave of outrage, with the locals voicing their concerns over the lack of decency and respect for the locality's culture, traditions, and values. While the city boasts of breathtaking architecture, such as Gaudi's Sagrada Familia, and attracts more than three million visitors every year, the challenges of accommodating them in a city that was not built for the scale of tourism it is receiving has become increasingly prominent. The increase in illegal tourist flats has only added fuel to the fire. Local authorities have been cracking down on such flats and levying heavy fines to discourage the practice. Tourism is an integral part of the city's economy, and it is undoubtedly a balancing act to cater to the tourists' needs and the local residents' expectations. The authorities must find a way to regulate this in a way that benefits both the tourists and the residents. The city's charm is undeniable, and its popularity is only growing. However, its success cannot come at the cost of the locals' well-being, and sustainable tourism should be the ultimate goal.
