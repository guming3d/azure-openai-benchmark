article: A glitch on the United Airlines website saw travellers offered return, first class flights from London to Newark for just $74 (£49). The round-trip first class tickets from Heathrow to Newark, just outside of New York City, were snatched up by lucky holidaymakers for just 491 Danish krone due to an apparent error on the site. By registering as a customer in Denmark, holidaymakers could snap up the deal, which would normally set them back $5,618 (£3,690) and $6,778 (£4,452). For a brief period of time on February 11, round-trip, first class fares from London to Newark were available on United.com for just £49 . It is unclear how the deal happened and it appears United has since made changes to prevent anyone else from purchasing the cheap tickets. One customer who snapped up the bargain fare said she simply logged on to United.com and changed her country status to Denmark. She then chose her dates and made sure to select business class or first class from the drop down menu, for example March 19 to March 25. Then, using a credit card without a foreign transaction fee, the purchase was completed and a confirmation email sent, although the customer did say she left her country as 'Denmark' when filling out her postal address. The unbelievable fare totalled 491 Danish krone, which comes to £49 or approximately US$74 . Despite the low costs, two customers reported 'miscellaneous' charges when they came to play, adding up to $326 (£214) to the price of the ticket. It is not known what these costs represent, but both customers said they were happy to pay as the price still worked out much cheaper than a full price first class ticket. MailOnline Travel attempted to secure the same deal at approximately 16:20 GMT, but found that selecting Denmark from the country drop down menu was no longer an option. A second customer secured first class transatlantic flights for a total of 1,356DKK - around $206 or £135 . The country option was then turned back to United Kingdom. It is as yet unclear how many people snapped up the flights during the time of the glitch and whether the airline will honour the bookings. According to a statement provided to MailOnline Travel: 'United has temporarily suspended sales from its Denmark website because a third-party software provider applied an incorrect exchange rate and was misquoting the airline’s properly filed fares. 'This error in the application of the exchange rate primarily impacted individuals who live outside of Denmark and who were not traveling to or from Denmark but were attempting to book tickets using United’s Denmark site.'
highlights: Earlier this afternoon, United.com glitch offered hugely discounted fares . First-class, round trip flights from London to Newark were just US$74 . As of 16:00 GMT, the website seems to be once again operating as normal .

chatgpt: A technical glitch on United Airlines website earlier today offered customers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for discounted fares. The airline's website displayed first-class, round trip flights from London to Newark for just $74, a fraction of the usual price. The error did not go unnoticed, as many eager travelers attempted to take advantage of the incredible deal. The discounted fare was made possible by a technical error that arose on United.com. The website's system was not reflecting the correct prices, leading to a situation where some prices were severely discounted. It is not known how many tickets were sold at the incorrect price. The error was quickly noticed by savvy travelers who quickly took to social media to discuss the opportunity. Many travelers expressed excitement at the possibility of snagging first-class tickets at a fraction of the cost. However, it was not meant to last. Within a few hours, United.com was operating normally, and fares had returned to their usual pricing. Despite the short-lived nature of the glitch, travelers who managed to secure tickets before the issue was resolved were undoubtedly pleased with their unexpected bargain. The tickets were sure to be in high demand, and it is likely that many would have missed out on the deal once it was corrected. United Airlines has yet to release a statement regarding the incident. However, it is likely that the company will face some backlash from travelers who missed out on the bargain due to the glitch. Additionally, the airline could face the possibility of lost revenue as a result of the mistake, as many travelers could choose to use other airlines that did not experience similar technical errors. The issue serves as a reminder of the importance of ensuring that technical systems are functioning correctly. Small errors in computer systems can lead to significant financial losses and reputational damage, as customers may lose trust in the company. United Airlines has not disclosed the cause of the glitch and is likely to be conducting an investigation to prevent similar occurrences in the future. While this incident is undoubtedly a setback for United Airlines, the company will likely bounce back quickly. United is a well-respected airline with an excellent reputation for customer service and punctuality. The airline has shown time and time again that it is capable of handling unexpected situations with professionalism and speed. In conclusion, the technical glitch on United.com offered customers an incredible opportunity for a bargain. While the glitch was short-lived, many travelers were undoubtedly pleased to take advantage of the discounted fare. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of ensuring that technical systems are functioning correctly, and highlights the potential for significant financial losses in the event of a technical error.
