article: By . Daily Mail Reporter . Worry: TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said the fact that the gap between the pay of top earners and the lowest-paid has 'soared' in parts of the country is 'bad news' for the economy . The gap between the pay of top earners and the lowest-paid has 'soared' in parts of the country, revealing huge wage inequality, new research has shown. A study by the TUC revealed that the pay gap had widened most in London and the South East, while only Wales and the South West had seen it reduce. The union organisation said wage inequality had risen by 4.5 per cent across the UK since 2000, and by 8.5per cent  in London. An analysis of official figures showed that between 2000 and 2013 the pay gap between the top ten per cent and the bottom ten per cent of earners in London rose by 14 per cent. A similar picture emerged in the South East and the Midlands. The highest top earners were in London where they receive £82,000 a year, followed by those in the South East who are on £57,000 and the East of England where they earn about £52,000. In contrast, an annual salary of about £46,000 puts workers in the top ten per cent of earners in Yorkshire and the Humber and £45,000 makes the top ten per cent in the North East. Top earners in Wales are on about £43,000 a year, nearly half of what those in London are taking home. TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: 'This new analysis shows how wage inequality has soared in parts of the UK over the last decade. This growing pay gap is bad news for our economy and bad news for living standards. 'The picture is particularly bleak in London and the South East, but in areas like the Midlands, the North West and the East of England, a significant gulf has developed between top and bottom earners. Gulf: An analysis of official figures showed that between 2000 and 2013 the pay gap between the top ten per cent and the bottom ten per cent of earners in London rose by 14 per cent . 'Unless this trend stops now and more high-skilled jobs with decent pay are created, this worrying pattern is likely to become even more entrenched. 'Everyone must benefit from the recovery, not just those at the top. The TUC wants to see a greater commitment to pay the living wage from both government and employers, a crackdown on excessive executive pay, and modern wages councils which could set higher minimum wages where employers can afford to pay more.' The TUC is holding a Fair Pay Fortnight from today as part of its campaign to raise awareness about low wages.

chatgpt: The gap between the top 10% and bottom 10% of earners has decreased in just two regions across the UK, according to new research by the Trades Union Congress (TUC). The study found that only Wales and the South West of England had shown a decrease in income inequality between 2000 and 2013. The city with the highest top earners was found to be London, where the top 10% of earners received an average of £82,000 per year – almost double the average top earner in the UK. However, the study found that between 2000 and 2013, the gap between the top and bottom 10% of earners in London had increased by 4.5%. The TUC's research also found that the average top earner in Wales receives around £43,000 per year, which is significantly lower than in London. Despite this, Wales was one of only two regions across the UK to show a reduction in the gap between the top and bottom earners. The study has sparked debate on the issue of income inequality across Britain, with some experts suggesting that more needs to be done to address the issue. Peter Cheese, Chief Executive of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), said: "These figures highlight the ongoing issue of income inequality and the need for organisations to be more transparent in their pay structures." The issue of income inequality has become increasingly relevant in recent years, with high-profile campaigns by activists such as the Fight for $15 in the US and the Living Wage Foundation in the UK. The TUC's research shows that while progress has been made in some regions, there is still a significant gap between the top and bottom earners across the UK. In response to the study, some have called for a fairer tax system, arguing that the wealthiest in society should pay more to address income inequality. Others argue that measures such as a Living Wage or a Universal Basic Income could help to reduce the gap between the top and bottom earners. Despite the debates that have been sparked by the report, some experts have also pointed out that income inequality is not just an issue of fairness, but also has economic implications. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), high levels of income inequality can lead to lower levels of economic growth. Overall, the TUC's research highlights the ongoing issue of income inequality across the UK, and the need for more action to be taken to address the gap between the top and bottom earners. While progress has been made in some regions, there is still much to be done to create a fairer and more equal society. With ongoing debates about the best ways to address the issue, it remains to be seen what steps will be taken to tackle income inequality in the UK in the years to come.
