article: The RSPCA has been criticised for shooting dead a sick foal then leaving it in sight of a children’s play area for several days with a note demanding that the owner remove the body. A second foal was left alone with the body and was in a state of ‘distress’ until it was rescued. After the foal was put down, the RSPCA inspectors left a letter headed ‘Removal of animals left unattended’ because they could not establish who the owner was. The RSPCA allegedly shot a foal and left its bloodied body in sight of a children's play area. File image . The foals are thought to have been dumped on the rough grazing land at Severn Beach, near Bristol, in an example of ‘fly grazing’. This entails abandoning unwanted animals on private land, thus making the landowner responsible for  their welfare. Labour MP Jim Fitzpatrick, of the Associate Parliamentary Group for  Animal Welfare, last night questioned  how the charity could have thought it acceptable to abandon the dead foal and  its companion. ‘It all sounds deeply unsettling,’  Mr Fitzpatrick said. ‘It certainly doesn’t sound like good practice. Jim Fitzpatrick described the incident as 'deeply unsettling' ‘The RSPCA should have done more to trace the landowner and get an appropriate responsible person to take care of the removal of the body.’ The shooting of the bay gelding on January 8 dismayed residents, who complained to the RSPCA and the local council. Resident Becky Ashdown said: ‘It was so sad to see that dead foal in the field,  just lying out in the open with blood all around its head. ‘The other one was left in the field with the carcass, and I think that  it was quite distressed. ‘The two horses were without water or food for weeks, and all they got was  from passers-by who felt sorry for them.’ Katie Merrett, of nearby Stroud, said:  ‘I have been in touch with the RSPCA and, as far as I can gather, they decided the foal had to be put down. They said it was the kindest thing to do. ‘It was very distressing for local children, leaving the body where they could see it from their play area.’ Last night the RSPCA defended its actions, saying the horse, which was unable to stand, had been put down on veterinary advice as a matter of animal welfare. A spokesman said that both it and the surviving foal had now been removed, and that the cost had been met by the owner, whom the charity had managed to trace.

chatgpt: The recent incident involving the RSPCA shooting a sick foal and leaving its body in a field for the owner to recover has sparked outrage among animal rights activists and concerned citizens. The incident took place in a dumping ground, which was in plain sight of a children's play area, raising questions about the RSPCA's ethics and responsibility. According to reports, the foal was sick and unable to stand, prompting the RSPCA to euthanize it on the spot. However, instead of properly disposing of the body, the RSPCA left it in the field, where it remained for several hours before the owner was notified. The owner was then forced to retrieve the body, which was a traumatic experience for them. Many have criticized the RSPCA for their lack of compassion and professionalism in handling the situation. They believe that the organization should follow proper procedures in dealing with sick and injured animals, and not leave their bodies lying around in public areas, where they can pose a health risk and be distressing for members of the public. Furthermore, the fact that the dumping ground was so close to a children's play area has raised concerns about the organization's responsibility to public safety. Parents in the area have expressed their dismay that their children were potentially exposed to the dead animal's body and the germs that may come with it. Some have even called for the RSPCA to be held accountable for the potential health hazard that the incident may have caused. The RSPCA has responded to the criticism, stating that their officers are trained to handle such situations, and that the foal's body was left in the field due to a miscommunication between officers. They have also stated that they have launched an investigation into the incident and will take any necessary measures to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. Despite the RSPCA's response, many remain skeptical about the organization's handling of the situation. Animal rights activists have called for greater transparency and accountability from the organization, and for measures to be put in place to prevent similar incidents from occurring. The incident has also reignited the debate around the RSPCA's effectiveness as an organization. Critics have accused the organization of focusing too much on media publicity and fundraising, rather than on providing effective animal welfare services. They believe that the incident with the sick foal is just one example of a wider problem within the organization. Overall, the incident involving the RSPCA shooting a sick foal and leaving its body in a field has sparked outrage and condemnation from concerned citizens and animal rights activists. The incident has raised serious questions about the organization's ethics, responsibility and effectiveness. While the RSPCA has responded by launching an investigation and promising to improve their procedures, many are calling for greater transparency and accountability from the organization, and for measures to be put in place to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
