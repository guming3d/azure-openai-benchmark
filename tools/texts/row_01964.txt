Leaning forward to blow out the candles on her 50th birthday cake, Ohio State coach Urban Meyer's wife Shelley managed to catch her hair on fire.

Indeed, before taking over at Ohio State, Urban was head coach of the Florida Gators from 2005 to 2010 and is famed for his motivational line, 'run like your hair's on fire'. Busy preparing for the upcoming Sugar Bowl with Alabama, Urban will go up against Nick Saban. Saban's top-seeded Alabama Crimson Tide (12-1) faces Meyer's fourth-seeded Ohio State Buckeyes (12-1) on New Year's Day, a semifinal matchup between two of the nation's most storied programs. Saban has established himself as perhaps the greatest coach of this generation, winning three national titles at Alabama after taking a BCS title during his time at LSU. Meyer captured a pair of national titles at Florida, and now he's two wins away from landing another with the Buckeyes.
