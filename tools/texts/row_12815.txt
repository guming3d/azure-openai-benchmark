article: At least 45 people were killed and 60 others wounded Sunday when a suicide bomber attacked a crowd watching a volleyball match in the Yahyakhil district of Afghanistan's southeastern Paktika province, according to a spokesman for the provincial governor. In 2010, a suicide car bomb exploded in the middle of a group of men playing volleyball, a popular sport in the region, in northwest Pakistan. That attack left 30 people dead and 52 wounded. Sunday's attack comes the same day the nation's parliament agreed to allow U.S. and NATO forces to remain in Afghanistan after 2014. It's unusual for an attack in Afghanistan to kill so many people. Only a few comparable incidents come up in the University of Maryland's Global Terrorism Database, which tracks acts of terror from 1970 to 2013. In October 2012, a suicide bomber dressed in a police uniform attacked a mosque in the city of Maymana in Faryab province, according to the database. At least 42 people, including 19 members of the Afghan security forces, were killed and another 50 people injured in that blast. No group claimed responsibility for the incident, but sources attributed it to the Taliban. In April 2013, nine attackers dressed as soldiers killed 53 people at a courthouse complex where several Taliban members were standing trial in the city of Farah. At least one suicide bomber detonated an explosives-laden vehicle at the entrance to the complex, while the other attackers entered other buildings and began shooting and throwing grenades. About 93 additional people were wounded. All of the attackers died, Global Terrorism Database reports. The Taliban said it was behind the carnage.

chatgpt: A suicide bombing at a volleyball match in eastern Afghanistan has left at least 45 people dead and numerous others injured. The incident occurred in the Yahyakhail district of Paktika province on Sunday, as locals gathered for a game. According to authorities, a suicide bomber detonated explosives at the site, causing widespread chaos and destruction. This is not the first time such an attack has happened in Afghanistan. In 2010, a similar attack at a volleyball match in Pakistan resulted in the deaths of 30 people. The Taliban has since claimed responsibility for the attack in response to the acceptance of NATO's continued presence in Afghanistan past 2014. The timing of the attack is particularly alarming, as it comes just as the Afghan parliament accepted the new agreement allowing NATO to remain in the country beyond the current withdrawal timeline. While the agreement is supported by the Afghan government and NATO forces, some opposition groups, including the Taliban, have been critical of the move. The Taliban has been known to use violence as a tool to create fear among civilians and challenge the authority of the Afghan government. The latest bombing underscores the ongoing security challenges faced by the Afghan government and NATO forces in the country. The casualties from the bombing included men, women, and children. Many of the wounded were airlifted to hospital in the nearby city of Khost for treatment. The local government has condemned the attack and promised to investigate the incident. The attack has been met with widespread condemnation by the international community, with many calling for increased efforts to address the issue of terrorism in the region. The Afghan authorities have pledged to continue to work with foreign forces to tackle the threat of terrorism and to ensure the safety and security of their citizens.
