article: (CNN) -- If you've ever been hit with one, you know how an unexpected "resort fee" can take your breath away. At up to $30 a night, the dollars quickly add up when you spend a few nights in a hotel that charges a mandatory fee for amenities that might include the use of the property's gym or pool. The element of surprise that accompanies some of these mandatory fees has caught the attention of the Federal Trade Commission, which recently sent a letter to 22 hotel operators warning that their online rate quotes may be deceptive and in violation of FTC regulations. The commission found that some of the hotel operators it addressed list only the room rate and taxes in online rate quotes, while listing mandatory fees separately either nearby or on another page, while other hotels list the fees in fine print or don't list additional fees at all, indicating only that other fees may apply. Hotels ready for the end of the world . "These practices may violate the law by misrepresenting the price consumers can expect to pay for their hotel rooms," the commission's letter to hoteliers said. "We believe that online hotel reservation sites should include in the quoted total price any unavoidable or mandatory fees, such as resort fees, that consumers will be charged to stay at the hotel." The FTC declined to name the hotel operators that received the letter. "This is the first time the FTC has publicly stated its position that it is deceptive for the hotels not to include mandatory fees as part of the total price they quote. We want to give the hotel operators an opportunity to come into compliance voluntarily before naming them publicly," said commission spokeswoman Betsy Lordan via e-mail. A hotel for every taste: Fodor's top 100 . Charging mandatory fees for amenities that are included at many hotels is a balancing act for hoteliers, according to Howard Adler, a professor of hotel management at Purdue University. Hotels make money on resort fees, but they can lead to customer dissatisfaction and loss of business, he said via e-mail. "Guest satisfaction is a very costly issue for hotels to deal with since (consumers) have so many choices and brand loyalty is fleeting at best," Adler said. Guests who are surprised by fees when the bill arrives can be especially troubled by them. The trade commission encouraged the hotel operators to review their online price quoting procedures warning that the FTC "may take action to enforce and seek redress for any violations of the FTC Act as the public interest may require." So guests will still have to pay the fees, but chances are, you'll know about them before the bill is slipped under the door. Business or pleasure? Luxury hotels offer day-only rooms .

chatgpt: The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has issued warnings to 22 hotel operators over the misrepresentation of prices on online reservation systems. The agency has said that hotels quote prices without including mandatory fees, triggering misleading prices for customers. "Customers have a right to know the full cost of a hotel stay. Hotels must provide clear and accurate information about their prices," said Commissioner Rohit Chopra. "We will continue to investigate and take action against illegal pricing practices that harm consumers." The commission has not disclosed the names of the hotels it has warned. However, the agency did state that they had been alerted by consumer complaints about the issue. The FTC has issued letters to the hotels outlining that omitting mandatory resort fees from the base room rate is likely to mislead customers. "With more than two-thirds of U.S. consumers using online booking sites to compare hotel prices, it is crucial that these sites provide accurate pricing information," said Chopra. The hotel industry has been under the spotlight for years, with many resorts and hotels charging mandatory resort fees to cover amenities such as Wi-Fi, pools, and fitness centers. These fees are not included in the advertised room rate, making it difficult for travelers to make an informed decision about where to stay. According to a report from Travelers United, mandatory resort fees could account for over 20% of a traveler's final bill, and may add anywhere between $20 and $50 on top of the advertised nightly rate. A separate study by the American Hotel and Lodging Association showed that 59% of U.S. hotels charge mandatory resort fees. The FTC's warning to the 22 hotel operators reflects an ongoing effort to protect consumers against misleading pricing tactics. The commission has urged online booking sites to better disclose resort fees and required them to provide a prominent link to a list of all mandatory fees before customers book. In 2012, the FTC fined Marriott International $600,000 for advertising room rates that excluded mandatory resort fees. Last year, the commission also issued warning letters to hotel and resort operators over similar practices. The letters followed an investigation into consumer complaints about mandatory resort fees. The hotel industry has received criticism for its use of mandatory resort fees, with some arguing that they are deceptive and anti-consumer. In response, some hotels have begun to include the fees in the base room rate to provide greater transparency. However, many hotels still charge resort fees and fail to disclose them in the advertised price. The FTC's latest warning to the hotel operators is a reminder to businesses that the agency will not tolerate deceptive pricing practices. Customers have the right to accurate and transparent pricing information, especially in the hospitality industry. It remains to be seen whether hotels will comply with the FTC's request and provide more transparent pricing for their guests.
