article: By . Rebecca English . Wildlife campaigners have described Prince William’s decision to go hunting just days before launching an anti-poaching crusade as ‘unfortunate’. The future king led a meeting at London Zoo yesterday, in his role as President of United for Wildlife, to develop an international response to the slaughter of endangered animals for their body parts. It was the prince’s first public appearance since spending the weekend at a Spanish hunting lodge owned by one of the richest men in the country, the Duke of Westminster, shooting wild boar and stag. Top guns: Prince William and Prince Harry arrive is Spain with friend Jecca Craig . Finca La Garganta in rural Cordoba spans 37,000 acres, and is one of the most exclusive hunting estates in western Europe. He and his brother Harry flew out last Thursday, along with a group of friends including Jecca Craig, whom Prince William is rumoured to have dated in the past. While the prince’s passion for  saving rhinos, elephants and tigers from extinction was praised yesterday, his weekend activities had not escaped the attention of fellow campaigners. Will Travers OBE, President of the Born Free Foundation, said: ‘I don’t think it was great timing and I personally do not hunt. Dame Jane Goodall, a leading British primatologist, said she agreed the prince's timing was unfortunate . ‘But I would say this – we mustn’t get these two issues confused. ‘This is all about industrial levels of wildlife crime linked to terrorist organisations, which will come to our door if we don’t do something about it. ‘I hope people can, whether they agree with hunting or not, leave that to a different debate and focus right now on wildlife crime.’ Dame Jane Goodall, a leading British primatologist, said she agreed the prince’s timing was unfortunate, but added: ‘The involvement of Prince William and Prince Charles has brought so much attention and it’s so important, because some of these species are actually vanishing.’ In a speech at the symposium, which brought together seven wildlife charities, William told supporters: ‘The forces that are currently destroying some of the world’s endangered species are sophisticated and powerful. 'But this week, we are seeing the creation of an equally powerful alliance, coming together to help fight them.’ The campaigners plan to use new technology to target poachers, as well as those who buy illegal rhino horn, ivory and tiger products such as their skins.

chatgpt: The future king of England made his first public appearance on Wednesday since he spent a weekend in Spain hunting wild boar and stag. Prince William led a meeting at the London Zoo, where he discussed the need for an international response to the ongoing slaughter of endangered animals. The meeting was attended by representatives from various conservation groups, including the WWF and the African Wildlife Foundation, as well as government officials and leaders from several African nations. The purpose of the meeting was to develop a strategy to combat the illegal poaching and trafficking of endangered species, which has reached crisis levels in many parts of the world. Prince William, who is well-known for his dedication to wildlife conservation, spoke passionately about the urgent need for action. "The illegal trade in wildlife is not only a grave threat to the survival of many species, but it also undermines the rule of law, fuels corruption, and funds armed groups," he said. "We must act now to protect the world's most iconic species and the natural habitats they depend on for their survival." The prince went on to discuss the importance of collaboration between nations and the need for a coordinated approach to the issue. "We need to work together to tackle this problem, from strengthening law enforcement and judicial systems to reducing demand for wildlife products and increasing public awareness of the issue," he said. The meeting was widely praised by conservation groups, who welcomed the prince's leadership on the issue. "Prince William's commitment to wildlife conservation is deeply inspiring, and we are grateful for his efforts to mobilize action on this critical issue," said Carter Roberts, president and CEO of the WWF. "We look forward to working with him and our partners to develop a comprehensive response to the illegal trade in wildlife." However, some critics were quick to point out the irony of Prince William's recent hunting trip in Spain. The prince, who is an avid sportsman, has faced criticism in the past for his participation in hunting expeditions. Some argued that his hunting trip undermines his credibility as an advocate for wildlife conservation. Despite the criticism, it was clear from the meeting that Prince William is committed to the cause. He closed the meeting by calling for a renewed sense of urgency in the fight to save endangered species. "We have a moral obligation to protect the world's wildlife for future generations," he said. "Let us work together to ensure that we do not fail in that obligation."
