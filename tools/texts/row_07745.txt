Craig Kaplan, a 3D printing enthusiast, designed the Little Dipper to solve the problem of biscuits being too big to be fully submerged. Originally marketed in America for kids who want to dunk biscuits in a small amount of milk before bed, they could also become a hit with tea lovers in Britain. The Little Dipper mug has been designed to perfectly accommodate and dunk a bisuit . Each cup holds 100ml of fluid and is . 8.5 cm long - perfect for a McVitie's chocolate digestive - and features . flared sides to allow the thumb and forefinger to be accommodated. Mr . Kaplan, an associate professor of Computer Science at the University of . Waterloo in Canada, said: 'My kids love to dip their cookies in milk . but the choice of cup poses a problem. 'A . cup large enough for whole-biscuit dipping must be filled with a huge . amount of milk, whereas a cup that holds the right amount of milk is . usually too narrow for proper dipping. 'The . sides of the cup are flared to allow thumb and forefinger to achieve . dipping perfection, and the drink can be drunk afterwards from one of . the narrow ends.' After . designing the cup it was created in ceramic by 3D printing service . Shapeways, which is now selling the pale blue mug for $36.82 USD (£22). Each cup holds 100ml of fluid and is 8.5 cm long - perfect for a McVitie's chocolate digestive . Last month, MailOnline reported how new research suggested the humble Rich Tea biscuit was the most robust biscuit for dunking. Of the five common biscuits studied, Rich Tea came out on top, with the Hobnob exposed as the least resilient dunker, becoming unstable after as few as three short dunks (approximately four seconds). This is because it is an oat-based, rather than wheat-based biscuit and the larger oat particles in the Hobnob provide less structural strength.
