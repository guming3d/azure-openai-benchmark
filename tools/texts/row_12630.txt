'While we may not be 100 per cent about it, as passionate football supporters just watching football as we have, it's going to be a big change. 'The other side of that is we have got to make sure we are on the bandwagon with them or we are going to get left behind otherwise. 'There's definitely going to be a run of games played abroad in 12 months or two years. 'Whatever happens with the changes in the Premier League, we have got to be finishing high enough to be part of it.

chatgpt: Premier League chairmen are once again looking into the possibility of playing overseas games, something that was previously rejected by FIFA and UEFA over a decade ago. Plans for a "39th game" were first proposed in 2008, with the idea of playing an extra game each season in a foreign country. However, it was met with fierce opposition and eventually dropped. Despite the setback, there are still those who believe that overseas games are a natural progression for the Premier League. Huw Jenkins, the chairman of Swansea City, recently stated that while he understands the previous opposition, he also believes that it is "inevitable" that matches will be played abroad in the future. Jenkins also revealed that plans for overseas games are already in motion and could arrive as early as 12 to 24 months from now. While the specific details are still being worked out, Jenkins suggested that it would likely involve teams playing one of their 38 regular-season matches in a foreign country. There are many potential benefits to playing overseas games, both for the Premier League and for the countries involved. For the league, it presents an opportunity to expand its global reach and tap into new markets, thereby increasing revenue streams. For the host countries, it provides a chance to showcase their own footballing talent and generate excitement among local fans. However, there are also concerns about the impact of overseas games on the players and the integrity of the competition. Critics argue that travelling across time zones and playing in unfamiliar conditions can have a detrimental effect on player performance, potentially altering the outcome of the match. There are also concerns about the fairness of having some teams play an extra game in a foreign country, possibly giving them an advantage over those who do not. Despite these concerns, it seems that the Premier League chairmen are determined to explore the potential benefits of overseas games. Whether or not they will be successful remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the Premier League has its sights set on the global stage, and it is willing to take risks to get there.
