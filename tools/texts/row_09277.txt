article: Washington (CNN) -- Federal officials and the nation's 15,000 air traffic controllers announced Wednesday they are extending an existing work contract for another four years. Controllers will get the same pay raise given to other federal government employees instead of independently negotiating raises, the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Air Traffic Controllers Association said. The announcement, coming six months before the expiration of the existing contract, suggests improved relations between management and labor. It appears both sides wanted to avoid the bruising battles that characterized some previous negotiations. Under the contract extension, work rules will remain the same, the FAA said. And the controllers will get the same raises the president and Congress authorize for other federal employees. The current contract was enacted in 2009 and was to expire on October 1. But the extension, which did not require a vote of the union's members, will prolong the agreement until July 1, 2016. In a joint statement, Acting FAA Administrator Michael Huerta and National Air Traffic Controllers Association President Paul Rinaldi said the extension serves both organizations. "This contract extension will provide stability for our work force; ensure continued collaboration to transform the air traffic system through NextGen , delivering more on-time and fuel-efficient flights; and continue to provide the safest air transportation system in the world." NextGen is the satellite-based navigation system that currently is being phased in to replace the existing ground-based radar system. Contract negotiations between the FAA and its controllers historically have been fractious. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan fired striking controllers, leading to the decertification of the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization, or PATCO. And, after contract talks broke down in 2005, the union worked for more than three years under a contract imposed by President George W. Bush and Congress.

chatgpt: Air traffic controllers have successfully reached a new collective bargaining agreement with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), avoiding the contentious negotiations of previous years. The agreement outlines pay raises for the controllers, bringing them in line with other federal employees. The contract was negotiated with the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), which represents the more than 15,000 air traffic controllers and other aviation safety professionals employed by the FAA. This agreement follows a lengthy negotiation process that began in February 2020 and involved multiple rounds of discussions between the FAA and NATCA. The negotiations were further complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced many meetings to take place remotely. Despite these challenges, the two sides were ultimately able to come to an agreement that NATCA President Paul Rinaldi described as a "mutual compromise." The new contract includes pay raises, which will be retroactive to last year and bring air traffic controllers in line with the pay raises approved for other federal employees. The agreement also covers other issues such as work schedules and retirement benefits. Air traffic controllers play a critical role in ensuring the safety of the nation's airspace. Their job requires a high level of skill and concentration, and they work in a high-stress environment where the margin for error is minimal. Over the years, air traffic controllers have faced a number of challenges, including high turnover rates and staffing shortages. By reaching this new agreement, the FAA and NATCA hope to alleviate some of these issues and ensure the continued safety of the nation's airspace. In a statement announcing the agreement, the FAA praised the professionalism and dedication of air traffic controllers, saying, "It is because of their hard work that the nation's aviation system remains the safest in the world." Overall, this new contract is a positive development for air traffic controllers and the aviation industry as a whole. By avoiding the fractious negotiation process of previous years, the agreement will hopefully provide greater stability and support for those responsible for ensuring the safety of our skies.
