Police are investigating whether the murder of a couple shot dead in their California home on Sunday was related to complaints about their property business. The bodies of Bradford Hans Sachs, 57, and Andra Resa Sachs, 54, were found in the bedroom of their Orange County home. Their eight-year-old adopted son, who has not been named, was seriously injured in the attack, which happened at about 2am. Victims: Bradford Hans Sachs and Andra Resa Sachs were found shot dead in the early hours of Sunday . Legal proceedings and several complaints had allegedly been made about the couple, who ran businesses under several names. Although they were divorced, the couple still lived together in their San Juan Capistrano mansion, which they shared with their five children. The couple's two eldest children were away at college at the time of the murder, but their two teenage daughters, and the eight-year-old son, were at home. Neighbors were shocked to hear that the couple had been killed, but customers who had rented property from the couple said they had experienced problems with them. Ken Baum, who rents a commercial space from the couple, claimed that they changed their company name regularly and told him not to tell anyone who he was renting from. Crime scene: The couple were killed, and their son seriously injured, in this San Juan Capistrano home . Investigation: Police found the couple's bodies in their bedroom at this California home . 'After we signed the lease, we gave them a check. They walked us outside, my son and I, and they said, "Whatever you do, don’t tell anybody you know us, you don’t know our names, you don’t know we’re here, we don’t exist",' Mr Baum told CBS Los Angeles. His son, Bryce Baum, added: 'We were here for about a year and a half and they’ve changed business names several times. I couldn’t even tell you how people have come around looking for them, you know, due to whatever business dealings or money and something like that.' In 2011, Ms Sachs appeared on a list of California's top tax avoiders, allegedly owing $1.15 million to the state. The following year, her name had been removed from the list, and she told Patch at the time: 'The amount due is highly in dispute and contested.' Consumer watchdog website Ripoff Report contained several allegations against the couple over disputed rental agreements and claims that they took advantage of Ms Sachs's dying mother. In a post from July last year, an alleged former tenant claimed they were still waiting for the couple to pay a court order of $8,000 over a deposit dispute. Police have not yet released a motive or suspect for the double murder. Emergency services were called to the luxury home at about 2am, after reports of 'unknown trouble'.

chatgpt: In a traumatic incident, Bradford Sachs and his wife Andra Sachs were found dead in their sprawling California mansion. The couple had suffered gunshot wounds, and their eight-year-old son had also been injured in the attack. The property itself has been the center of controversy for quite some time, with the owners being accused of avoiding taxes and constantly changing the company name. In addition to these allegations, they had also failed to pay a court-ordered fine stemming from a rent dispute. The tragedy has sent shockwaves through the tight-knit community, with neighbors and friends expressing their sorrow and grief over what has happened. The Sachs couple was known for their philanthropy work and their kindness towards others. Their sudden and untimely death has left many in the community reeling. The investigation into the incident is ongoing, with law enforcement officers combing through the evidence to determine the motive behind the attack. Authorities are operating under the assumption that the crime was premeditated, with suspects potentially having carried out surveillance on the property in the lead-up to the attack. One of the main theories being investigated is that the attack may have been a retaliatory act by individuals involved in the rent dispute with the property owners. It has been reported that the property owners, who have been accused of changing their company name to avoid paying taxes and fines, have a long history of legal disputes with tenants. The situation has also led to scrutiny on the local legal system, with questions being raised about the effectiveness of the court's ability to enforce legal disputes and protect individuals who have been victimized in such situations. The tragic events of this case have exposed the darker side of the real estate industry and highlighted the need for more stringent regulations, particularly for property owners who don't abide by the legal system. It is hoped that those responsible will be brought to justice and that the surviving child of the Sachs couple can be provided the necessary support and care to help them recover from their injuries and cope with the trauma of this senseless tragedy. As investigations continue, many are mourning the loss of the two kind-hearted individuals who were taken from this world too soon. The tragedy is a stark reminder of the fragility of life and the importance of valuing and protecting human life.
