article: Ban: Jeremy Irons is leading a campaign to stop HGVs from using his home town as a rat-run . He is a passionate campaigner on green issues, and now Jeremy Irons has backed a campaign to ban lorries from the quaint Oxfordshire town where he lives. The Oscar–winning actor has thrown his weight behind an action group to prevent HGVs using the narrow streets of Watlington as a rat-run between the M40 and M4. The market town - reputedly the smallest in the country - is regularly snarled up with lorries whose drivers, looking for a shortcut between Oxford and Reading, are directed there by their satnavs. Watlington Against Pollution and HGVs plans to put pressure on local councils to take action against the out-of-place vehicles. Irons, 65, star of Brideshead Revisited, lives in the picturesque town with his wife, Sinead Cusack, which has been used as the backdrop for ITV crime drama, Midsomer Murders. Nestled between the Vale of Oxford and the steep slopes of the Chilterns, records show it was once the site of a Saxon settlement in the 8th century. But Bronze Age axe and Roman coins have also been excavated, suggesting it has a much earlier past. Keith Lovelace, the group's chairman, said: 'Jeremy Irons is a resident of Watlington and he feels strongly about it so it makes sense for him to be part of it. 'We all know that if there is a celebrity behind a cause then it gets better publicity. 'We have a lot of people behind us and we are determined to succeed.'

Unsuitable: The narrow streets of the ancient market town regularly become snarled up with HGVs . Rat-run: HGVs, directed by satnavs, take the shortcut between the M4 near Reading and the M40 . This was due to the number of large vehicles and the tall buildings in narrow streets acting like a canyon affect, trapping it low to the ground. Irons, who won the Oscar for Best Actor in 1991 for his portrayal of the fictional character Claus von Bülow in the Hollywood blockbuster, Reversal of Fortune, agreed to become patron after being made aware of the pressure group by his personal assistant, who was already a member. Mr Lovelace said they understood the need for lorries to supply businesses and deliveries to homeowners, and the group is targeting passing HGVs. One measure being looked at is to introduce a congestion charge scheme.

chatgpt: Renowned British actor, John Hurt, has taken up a new cause that hits close to home. Hurt is leading the Watlington Against Pollution and HGVs campaign fighting for a ban on lorries using the town as a rat-run. Watlington, a historic market town nestled in the Chiltern Hills, has seen an alarming increase in heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) over the years. Many of these lorries cut through the town on their way between the M4 and M40. The noise pollution and air pollution have caused significant disruptions to daily life for the residents of the town. Hurt, a long-time Watlington resident, has been an advocate for sustainable living for years. The actor, known for his iconic performances in films like "The Elephant Man" and "Harry Potter," has been an active member of the town's community. He has been vocal about the importance of preserving the town's heritage and maintaining its natural beauty. Watlington Against Pollution and HGVs was formed in response to growing concerns about the health and safety of the town's residents. As the number of lorries passing through the town steadily increased, so did the levels of pollution. This issue sparked a community-wide effort to make Watlington a safer, healthier place for everyone. Hurt and the group have been campaigning for a ban on lorries using the town as a shortcut. Instead, they advocate for a bypass that would divert traffic away from the town center. They argue that a bypass would improve air quality, reduce noise pollution, and make the town safer for pedestrians and cyclists. The campaign has gained widespread support from the community, with many residents joining the group's efforts. In addition, the group has garnered local media attention and has even caught the eye of national politicians. Hurt, who has always been passionate about environmental issues, believes that this campaign is a crucial step towards a more sustainable future. He hopes that other towns will follow in Watlington's footsteps and prioritize the health and wellbeing of their residents. The campaign recently received a boost from Oxfordshire County Council, which has agreed to fund a feasibility study for a bypass. This is a significant milestone for the group, which has been working tirelessly for years to bring attention to the issue. While the road to a bypass is a long one, Hurt and the Watlington Against Pollution and HGVs group remain committed to their cause. They believe that the health and safety of the town's residents are worth fighting for and will continue to work towards a brighter, greener future. In conclusion, John Hurt and the Watlington Against Pollution and HGVs campaign have taken on the critical task of fighting for a ban on HGVs in Watlington. The group's efforts have gained significant momentum, and they hope to see a bypass established that would improve air quality, reduce noise pollution, and make the town safer for everyone. As the campaign gains more attention and support, it is clear that Hurt and the community of Watlington are leading the way for sustainable living in the UK.
