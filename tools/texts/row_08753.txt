Bill Moggridge, the British industrial designer who designed the early portable computer with the flip-open shape that is common today, has died. The Grid, his first deign, was the blueprint for laptops still in use today. The Grid Compass cost $8,150 in 1982 . Processor: Intel 8086 processor . Screen: 320 × 240-pixel yellow and black display . Memory: 340-kilobyte magnetic bubble memory . Communications: 1,200 bit/s modem . Moggridge is credited with the design of the Grid Compass, a computer that had a keyboard and yellow-on-black display that sold for $8,150 when it was released in 1982. It was encased in magnesium and seen as rugged, and was used by the U.S. military. The computer made its way into outer space aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery in 1985. Although there were many portable computers being developed around that time, Grid Systems Corp. won the patent for the clamshell design with the foldable screen hinged toward the back of the machine, said Alex Bochannek, a curator at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif. Moggridge pushed for this foldable design when it was realized the flat-panel screen, keyboard and circuitry could all fit snugly together. Moggridge, who was 69, died on Saturday, Sept. 8, 2012 from cancer. 'In terms of the industrial design of the enclosure, Moggridge was instrumental in proposing that,' Bochannek said. 'He came up with that particular form factor.' Until that point, portable computers resembled portable sewing machines that weighed more than 20 pounds and had a big handle, he said. It was after using the machine that Moggridge’s ideas about design began to change, Bochannek said. His work began to focus more on how people interacted with devices, rather than just making sure they were enclosed well. A co-founder of design consultancy firm IDEO, Moggridge authored the books 'Designing Interactions,' which was published in 2006, and 'Designing Media,' published in 2010. 'Beloved by the museum staff and the design community at large, Bill touched the lives of so many through his wise council, boundary-pushing ideas and cheerful camaraderie,' said Caroline Baumann, associate director of the museum, in a statement. He is survived by his wife of 47 years, Karin, and two sons Alex and Erik.

chatgpt: The Grid Compass, a rugged computer that was used in space, cost an incredible £5095 ($8,150) when it was first released in 1982. This groundbreaking computer was designed by William Moggridge, an industrial designer who was also responsible for the design of the first laptop computer.  The Grid Compass was an incredibly innovative piece of technology, featuring a number of features that were not commonly found on other computers at the time. For example, it was incredibly durable and could withstand harsh conditions, making it an ideal choice for use in the military, on expeditions, and even in space. One of the most impressive feats that the Grid Compass achieved was its use on the Space Shuttle Discovery. In 1985, the computer was taken aboard the shuttle as part of a mission to deploy a joint US-French satellite. The computer played a vital role in the success of this mission, providing the astronauts on board with valuable data and calculations. Despite its high price tag, the Grid Compass was a popular choice for both individuals and organizations. Its rugged design and powerful capabilities made it an ideal choice for anyone who needed a reliable and durable computer. It was used by a wide range of people, including military personnel, scientists, and even journalists. Unfortunately, despite its popularity, the Grid Compass was not able to maintain its position as a leading computer device. Newer, more advanced technology soon emerged, and the Grid Compass was left behind. However, its legacy lives on - it is widely regarded as one of the most impressive and innovative pieces of computer technology of its time. In addition to its use in space, the Grid Compass was also utilized in a number of other important projects. For example, it was used extensively by the US military during the 1983 invasion of Grenada. In this conflict, the computer was used to calculate artillery trajectories, make tactical decisions, and communicate with other units. Overall, the Grid Compass was an incredibly innovative and groundbreaking piece of technology that played a crucial role in a number of important projects. Despite its high price tag and eventual obsolescence, it remains a fascinating and important piece of computer history. For anyone interested in the development of technology over time, the Grid Compass is well worth studying and learning about.
