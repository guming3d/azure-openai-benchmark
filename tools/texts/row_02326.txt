chatgpt: In what can be considered a dominant display, Spain easily saw off Luxembourg 4-0 in their Euro 2016 qualifier on Sunday. The Spaniards controlled the game from start to finish, with impeccable passing and fluid movement on the pitch. Diego Costa, who has been under scrutiny lately due to his slower start with Spain than with Chelsea, finally got off the mark for the national team. The striker scored his first goal for Spain, and it was an important one, as it opened the floodgates for a comfortable evening for the defending champions. Despite some early pressure from the home side, Spain took the lead in the 10th minute thanks to a header from Paco Alcacer. He met a cross from the right and powered his header past the goalkeeper. That goal seemed to settle the Spanish team, who started to enjoy more possession and control of the midfield. The second goal came from Jordi Alba, who found himself in the right place at the right time to slot home a rebound after a shot from Santi Cazorla was saved. The third goal was undoubtedly the highlight of the evening. Diego Costa received a pass from Juan Mata just outside the box and unleashed a thunderous shot that flew into the top corner. His celebration showed just how much that goal meant to him, as he had been heavily criticized for his lack of goals with Spain. The fourth and final goal came in the second half when substitute Cesc Fabregas scored from close range after a good team move. The scoreline could have been even higher, as Spain missed several good opportunities to score. On a different note, AC Milan president, Silvio Berlusconi, has made the shocking revelation that he advised against the club's purchase of striker Mario Balotelli. The Italy international joined the Serie A club for £19million in January 2013, but has struggled to make an impact. Berlusconi told reporters: "I didn't want to buy Balotelli. I told (Vice-President Adriano) Galliani, 'don't buy Balotelli', but Galliani did it anyway." This revelation sheds some light on Balotelli's difficult time at Milan, where he has been accused of inconsistent performances and a lack of commitment to the team. In conclusion, Spain's victory over Luxembourg will give them a much-needed confidence boost as they seek to defend their Euro championship next year. At the same time, Berlusconi's comments on Balotelli will raise questions about the player's future at AC Milan and whether he will be able to turn around his fortunes at the club.
