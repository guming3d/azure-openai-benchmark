article: By . Fiona Macrae . Stress: The study found that children as young as one year old can pick up on negative emotions . As if being a mother wasn’t stressful enough. Scientists say that stress is contagious and can be passed from mother to child. They showed that 12-month-old boys and girls not only pick up that their mother is under pressure, they also start to become anxious themselves. The researchers said: ‘Before infants are verbal and able to express themselves fully, we can overlook how exquisitely attuned they are to the emotional tenor of their caregivers. ‘Your infant may not be able to tell you that you seem stressed or ask you what is wrong, but our work shows that, as soon as she is in your arms, she is picking up on the bodily responses accompanying your emotional state and immediately begins to feel in her own body your own negative emotion.’ The University of California, San Francisco, researchers asked 69 mothers to come into the lab with their babies, who were around a year old. The babies were taken to a playroom, while their mothers made a five-minute speech and then took part in a question and answer session. Some of the women received encouragement as they spoke, while others were faced with frowns and crossed arms. A third group made their speech to an empty room. The women were then reunited with their babies and the children’s heart rate measured. The women whose speeches had received negative feedback felt more stressed – and their babies picked up on this, with their heart rates speeding up within minutes of sitting on their mother’s lap. And the more pressured the woman felt, the greater the effect on the child, the journal Psychological Science reports. Mechanism: It is thought the babies may pick up on changes in tone of voice, touch or smell to work out their mother's emotions . Lead researcher Sara Waters said: ‘Our earliest lessons about how to manage stress and strong negative emotions in our day-to-day lives occur in the parent-child relationship. ‘Our research shows that infants "catch" and embody the physiological residue of their mothers’ stressful experiences.’ It is thought the infants may have reacted to a change in their mother’s voice, touch or facial expression. Even the smell of sweat might have an effect. Such research may help shed light on how children are affected by their parent's health. The researchers said: ‘A common question in public health circles is how stress and social environment “gets under the skin” to affect health both at an individual and at a familial level. ‘With this admittedly modest study, we show a possible mechanism for how stress is transmitted from parent to child.’

chatgpt: A new study by scientists at the University of California has revealed a surprising link between maternal stress and infant behavior. The study, published in the journal Pediatrics, found that infants pick up on their mothers' negative emotions within just minutes of experiencing stress, potentially leading to longer-term developmental issues. The experiment involved testing the heart rates of 69 new mothers in a stressful situation, finding that their heart rates were elevated when compared to those of mothers in a relaxed state. Researchers then placed their infants in front of them and measured their reactions to their mother's elevated heart rate. The study found that within just minutes of seeing and hearing their mother in a stressful situation, infants began to display signs of distress, including crying and increased agitation. Researchers believe that these negative emotions may pass from mother to baby, leading to long-term developmental issues. "Research has shown that chronic stress can have lasting effects on a child's mental health," said lead author Sarah Waters, a doctoral student in psychology at the University of California, Irvine. "Our study suggests that even brief episodes of maternal stress can have an impact on a child's development and well-being." While further research is needed to determine the exact mechanisms behind these findings, the study highlights the importance of supporting new mothers and providing them with the necessary resources to manage stress and promote positive mental health outcomes. "We need to make sure that mothers have access to the support and resources they need to manage stress and promote positive mental health outcomes," said Waters. "This could include things like counseling and support groups, as well as access to affordable childcare and flexible work schedules." Experts say that the findings of this study could have implications for healthcare providers and policymakers, particularly in the area of maternal healthcare. "With this new information in mind, healthcare providers may want to consider screening for maternal stress and providing resources to help manage it," said Dr. Amanda Waterman, a pediatrician at Children's Hospital Los Angeles who was not involved in the study. "Similarly, policymakers may want to consider implementing policies that support maternal mental health, such as paid parental leave and affordable childcare." The study's authors note that while maternal stress and its impact on infant development is a complex issue, their findings highlight the importance of providing support to new mothers in order to promote positive outcomes for both mother and child. "As a society, we need to recognize the importance of maternal mental health and ensure that new mothers have the support and resources they need to thrive," said Waters. "This includes everything from access to affordable healthcare and childcare to counseling and other support services that can help manage maternal stress."
