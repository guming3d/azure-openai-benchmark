His colleague, a PC also in his 40s and who has served with West Midlands Police for 13 years, suffered serious fractures to both legs. The officers were given emergency first aid by colleagues at the scene in Tipton, before specially trained firearms officers arrived to give assistance.

The incident happened on a busy road, and luckily there were no pedestrians nearby.

The man's car was parked across the road at the time of the crash, and fortunately it was only his car that was affected. No other vehicle was involved in the incident. Witnesses to the accident stated that the driver appeared to have been swerving before colliding with the matrix. Adding insult to injury, the neon sign attached to the matrix, which was displaying the message "Don't drink and drive" at the time of the accident, served as an ironic reminder of the consequences of driving under the influence of alcohol. The driver was arrested by local authorities and has been charged with driving under the influence of alcohol. He is due to appear before a local court in the near future.

With the holiday season fast approaching, it is essential for all road users to think carefully before consuming alcohol and getting behind the wheel.
