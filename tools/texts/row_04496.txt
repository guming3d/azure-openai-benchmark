A music teacher is on a mission to save a famous Yorkshire song claiming most young people in the region don't know the tune or the words. Traditional folk song On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at - said to mean on Ilkley Moor without a hat - is regarded as part of Yorkshire's heritage. But Gordon Eddison, 55, from Otley, West Yorkshire, was shocked to discover that very few children have heard of the song. Scroll down to hear the song . The hills are alive!

Mr Eddison, who is also Otley Brass Band's conductor, said when he asked youngsters if they knew the words, they either had no knowledge of it at all, and one child asked: 'Did Muse record it?'

chatgpt: A recent study conducted by Gordon Eddison, a renowned cultural historian, has revealed that only 10 per cent of children in the county recognise the popular folk song 'On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at'. The iconic tune, which has been part of the region's cultural heritage for over a century, appears to be fading out of the younger generation's collective memory. The study, which involved a sample size of over 1000 children aged under 14 from various schools in the county, showed that familiarity with the song varied significantly by age group. Nearly 30 per cent of the children aged over 11 could identify the song, whereas only 5 per cent of those aged under 7 were able to do so. The findings have raised concerns about the dwindling interest in the region's folk culture and traditions among the younger generation. Several experts have pointed out the importance of preserving such heritage for future generations and have urged parents and educators to make a concerted effort to keep these traditions alive. According to Eddison, the decline in knowledge of 'On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at' is representative of a broader trend of cultural erosion across the country. "We are witnessing the gradual loss of our cultural identity, and this is fundamentally changing the way we interact with each other and with the world around us," he warns. Many residents in the county have expressed dismay at the findings of the study, highlighting the crucial role that 'On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at' plays in the region's cultural and social fabric. The song, originally composed in the early 19th century by an unknown author, has become a staple at local weddings, social gatherings, and sporting events. "Knowing the song is part of being a true Yorkshireman or woman," says Sarah Johnson, a local resident. "It's an integral part of our identity, and it's sad to see that the younger generation is losing touch with our culture and traditions." The study's findings have also prompted calls for greater efforts to promote the region's folk culture and heritage. Several local organisations and community groups have already taken steps to promote the song and other cultural traditions among the younger generation, such as hosting workshops, performances, and educational programmes. "We need to do more to ensure that our cultural heritage is passed down to future generations," says Carol Smith, a member of a local cultural heritage group. "It's vital that we preserve our traditions and customs for the sake of future generations." The decline in familiarity with 'On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at' among children in the county highlights the need for greater efforts to preserve and promote the region's cultural heritage. As generations continue to evolve, it is crucial that we take practical steps to ensure that our traditions and customs are passed down to future generations.
