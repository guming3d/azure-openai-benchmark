article: Is soccer's glass ceiling finally cracking? French second-tier side Clermont Foot hinted at a new dawn for the sport after appointing the country's first ever professional female coach for a male team. Helena Costa, who was previously in charge of the Iran women's national team, will take over the reins at Clermont next season. The 36-year-old will become the first female coach of a French professional football club, while her appointment, announced Wednesday, represents the first time a team in the top two divisions of one of Europe's big five leagues -- Spain, Germany, England, Italy and France -- has hired a female manager. "Clermont Foot 63 has chosen Helena Costa to be our new coach," a statement confirming the appointment read. "This appointment will allow Clermont Foot 63 to begin a new era, relying on a group of 17 players currently under contract, which will be added by young players from the club." The Portuguese will succeed Regis Brouard, who is currently in charge of Clermont but is leaving at the end of the season when his contract expires. Costa, a sports science graduate, has been rewarded following her work with the Iran and Qatar women's national teams, while she also led Benfica's male youth team to two World Youth titles. She also spent time as a scout with Scottish club Celtic. Currently 14th in Ligue 2, Clermontwill introduce Costa to the French media after the season's final set of fixtures. Male chauvinism . While Costa is the first ever female coach in French professional football, Nelly Viennot previously served as an assistant referee in France, also featuring in Champions League games. The English Premier League boasts two high-profile females, with Eva Carneiro fulfilling the role of Chelsea's first-team doctor, while Karren Brady is West Ham's vice chairman. Former England women's national team manager Hope Powell was linked with the Grimsby job in 2009, although she denied that she was ever in the running for the post. In Italy, Carolina Morace took charge of Italian Serie C1 team Viterbese for two matches in 1999. Maria Jose Claramunt, meanwhile, is currently the director of the Spanish national team, however, she is responsible for marketing issues rather than sporting ones. Historically women working in the football industry have had to contend with male chauvinism. Richard Keys and Andy Gray were household names on British broadcaster Sky Sports -- two men who presented football to UK viewers for so long they had become an integral part of the game itself. But both were forced to leave the broadcaster in 2011 shortly after they were caught making derogatory remarks about female match official Sian Massey. Talking near a microphone they thought had been turned off, Gray said: "Can you believe that? A female linesman. Women don't know the offside rule." Keys replied: "Course they don't."

chatgpt: Clermont Foot, a French football club, has made history by appointing Helena Costa as their new coach. Costa, a Portuguese national, is set to become France's first-ever professional female coach in a move that has been widely praised by football fans and experts alike. Costa joins Clermont Foot after working as the coach of the Iran women's side. She has also had previous coaching experience with the Benfica youth team and the Qatar women's national team. Her appointment at Clermont Foot is an impressive achievement, particularly given the traditionally male-dominated nature of professional football. Speaking about her appointment, Costa said, "It's a great honour to be given the chance to coach a professional football team in France. I'm thrilled to be joining Clermont Foot and I'm looking forward to working with the players and staff to achieve our goals for the upcoming season." Clermont Foot's President, Claude Michy, also expressed his excitement at the appointment, stating, "We are delighted to have Helena on board as our new coach. She has shown great skill and determination in her previous coaching roles and we believe she will be an excellent addition to our team." The move has been praised by many as a positive step towards increased diversity and representation in professional football. Women have traditionally been underrepresented in the coaching and management sides of the game, with very few women occupying leadership positions in major football clubs and organizations worldwide. Costa's appointment at Clermont Foot is particularly significant as the club has never appointed a female coach before. As one of the oldest football teams in France, the club has a long-standing history in the sport and has typically been associated with traditional, conservative values. However, the club's decision to appoint Costa is evidence of the changing attitudes towards women in football and a recognition of their ability to lead and succeed in high-pressure environments. Costa's impressive track record as a coach and her experience working in diverse cultural settings also make her an excellent candidate for the role. As France's first-ever professional female coach, Costa will no doubt inspire a new generation of women to pursue leadership roles in the sport. Her appointment marks a milestone in the history of professional football and is a positive step towards increased representation and diversity in the game. Clermont Foot, meanwhile, will be hoping that Costa's appointment will lead to success on the field. With her expertise and leadership, the team will be looking to make a mark in the upcoming season and compete against some of France's biggest and most successful football clubs.
