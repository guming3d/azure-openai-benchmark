article: A federal judge in Utah has struck down part of that state's law banning polygamy, after a lawsuit was brought by the stars of the television reality series "Sister Wives." The ruling late Friday by U.S. District Court Judge Clark Waddoups threw out  the law's section prohibiting "cohabitation," saying it violates constitutional guarantees of due process and religious freedom. But the judge said he would keep in place the ban on bigamy "in the literal sense -- the fraudulent or otherwise impermissible possession of two purportedly valid marriage licenses for the purpose of entering into more than one purportedly legal marriage." The 91-page decision comes months after the Supreme Court struck down a separate federal law that defined marriage as between only one man and one woman, a major legal, political, and social victory for homosexual couples seeking recognition of their same-sex unions. The current suit was brought two years ago by Kody Brown, a Utah resident and his four wives -- Meri, Janelle, Christine, and Robyn -- who together have 17 children, and whose lives are chronicled on the TLC cable television program. Polyamory: When three isn't a crowd . They claim their privacy rights were being violated by the decades-old law, passed around the time Utah became a state. They are members of a fundamentalist branch of the Mormon Church  known as the Apostolic United Brethren Church. Brown and his family  said in a statement they were grateful for the ruling. "Many people do not approve of plural families," he said, but "we hope that in time all of our neighbors and fellow citizens will come to respect our own choices as part of this wonderful country of different faiths and beliefs." Some religious groups criticized the ruling. "This is what happens when marriage becomes about the emotional and sexual wants of adults, divorced from the needs of children for a mother and a father committed to each other for life," said Russell Moore, of the Southern Baptist Convention. "Polygamy was outlawed in this country because it was demonstrated, again and again, to hurt women and children. Sadly, when marriage is elastic enough to mean anything, in due time it comes to mean nothing." There was no initial reaction to the ruling from Utah officials, but they are expected to appeal. The case is Brown v. Buhman (2:11-cv-652).

chatgpt: On Friday, a U.S. District Court Judge issued a decision related to Utah's longstanding ban on bigamy. The ruling holds that a section of Utah's polygamy law that specifically prohibits "cohabitation" is unconstitutional. The decision stems from a lawsuit filed by Kody Brown and his wives. Kody is famously known for his role on the reality television show "Sister Wives," which has been on-air since 2010. In the lawsuit, Kody and his wives challenged Utah's polygamy statute, arguing that it violated their constitutional rights to privacy and religious freedom.  U.S. District Court Judge Clark Waddoups' ruling upheld the ban on bigamy in its "literal," fraudulent-intent sense. This means that individuals who obtain multiple marriage licenses without disclosing their previous marriages will still be subject to prosecution. However, Judge Waddoups agreed with the plaintiff's arguments that the "cohabitation" portion of the law was problematic. In his ruling, Judge Waddoups noted that under Utah's current law, an individual could be charged with bigamy solely for residing with multiple partners, even if they were not legally married to more than one person. This created a situation where a person could be punished for engaging in consensual adult relationships, which Judge Waddoups found to be unconstitutional under the U.S. Constitution's Due Process Clause. While Utah's Attorney General's Office plans to appeal the decision, many are hailing the ruling as a victory for the rights of polyamorous individuals in Utah and beyond. Activists argue that the "cohabitation" prohibition effectively criminalized a lifestyle choice that should not be considered illegal. Kody Brown and his wives also discussed the significance of the ruling in a statement released on Friday. "We are so excited and grateful for the judge's ruling todayâ€¦ We have spent years under investigation and prosecution for our family's way of life, and we hope that this decision will bring an end to the targeting of families like ours." While legal challenges to polygamy and polyamory laws continue to unfold across the country, Friday's ruling has the potential to set a precedent for others in similar legal battles. As the debate over the rights of non-monogamous individuals rages on, this decision has the potential to shape the conversation and pave the way for a more equitable future.
