article: By . Margot Peppers for MailOnline . Cashmere not only expensive but also notoriously difficult to clean, but a new invention may well change that. A team of scientists from City University of Hong Kong's School of Energy and Environment have developed an invisible coating that triggers a chemical reaction when exposed to light. When the mineral, which is made from anatase titanium dioxide, coats the fabric, any stain - from dirt to coffee and even red wine - on its surface will be eliminated after being placed in light for 24 hours.

No need for dry cleaning: A team of scientists from City University of Hong Kong have developed an invisible coating that can make cashmere wool clean itself when exposed to light . Like magic: When the anatase titanium dioxide coats the fabric, any stain - from dirt to coffee and even red wine - on its surface will be eliminated after being placed in light for 24 hours . What's more, lead scientist Walid Daoud says that the finished fabric will only bump up the price of cashmere by one to 1.5per cent. Not only is the invention the ultimate in smart technology, but it's also beneficial to the environment. 'On the one hand, clothes that can clean themselves are regarded as smart material,' said Mr Daoud. 'And on the other hand ... we also have less consumption of energy, of water, of chemicals.' The coating was actually first developed in 2002, but applying it to cashmere has proved difficult since the delicate fabric is especially prone to damage. Two-fold: 'Clothes that can clean themselves are regarded as smart material,' explained lead scientist Walid Daoud. 'And on the other hand... we also have less consumption of energy, of water, of chemicals' Special: The notoriously expensive cashmere wool is produced from the undercoat of Cashmere goats that only live in mountainous regions of Mongolia, Tibet and China . The notoriously expensive cashmere wool . is produced from the undercoat of Cashmere goats that only live in . mountainous regions of Mongolia, Tibet and China. 'It is a delicate operation because of the risk of spoiling the cashmere in the process,' Mr Daoud told FastCoExist. 'How to apply nano-sized photocatalysts to cashmere and retain its delicate characteristics was a huge challenge.' But now that the technology has been perfected, he expects it to be a big hit in the fashion industry.

chatgpt: Scientists from City University of Hong Kong have developed an innovative invisible coating, which triggers a chemical reaction when exposed to light for 24 hours. This coating is made from the mineral anatase titanium dioxide and is predicted to soon hit the mainstream market. Interestingly, the coating is not only effective, but it is also cost-efficient. It only raises the overall price of cashmere by about one per cent, which means that it is accessible to people of all economic backgrounds. The benefits of the coating are numerous, and it has the potential to revolutionize the way we care for our clothing. By applying the coating to cashmere, it prevents the growth of bacteria and fungi, and it also helps to repel stains and odors. This means that cashmere items can be enjoyed for longer periods, as they will not require as much washing and will retain their quality for a longer period. The scientists behind the development have already received significant investment towards the project as the potential benefits are huge â€“ not only in consumer convenience but also in terms of sustainability. By prolonging the life of cashmere items, the ecological footprint of cashmere production and disposal is minimized. It is also important to note that this development is not just limited to the cashmere industry. The coating could be applied to a wide range of fabrics, including cotton and wool. The development of the invisible coating technology highlights the ongoing advancements in the field of material science, and how they can bring about significant change in our daily lives. While the development of the technology is exciting news, it is also important to address ethical concerns that may arise as a result of commercializing the coating. Questions around the materials used and the potential ecological impact of the process must be addressed and regulated. Despite these concerns, the scientific breakthrough is promising, and has the potential to change the fashion industry for the better. The invisibility of the coating means that it is not only efficient, but also aesthetically pleasing, with no compromise on the look and feel of the fabric. Overall, the development of the invisible coating made from anatase titanium dioxide is good news for both consumers and the environment. It is cost-efficient and has the potential to reduce the waste and environmental impact of the fashion industry.
