article: By . Simon Jones . The fate of Luis Suarez should become clearer on either August 11 or 12 when his case is to be heard at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Barcelona have pressed for an express hearing to determine the length of his ban following his bite on Italy's Giorgio Chiellini. It stands at four months. They will contend and barter that his nine-match international ban with Uruguay should still stand but that the four-month domestic ban from 'any football-related activities' should be reduced. The tooth hurts: Suarez was banned from all football for four months after biting Chiellini . Mega move: Suarez is mobbed by fans as he walks around in his new home of Barcelona . Getting shirty: But Barcelona fans will not be able to watch Suarez in action until late October as it stands . The 27-year-old's lawyer described FIFA's punishment as 'draconian, totalitarian and fascist' and CAS insiders believe Barca may have some success in their bid to have him playing ahead of schedule in La Liga. He has yet to be formally presented as a Barcelona player following his £75million move from Liverpool although if the ban remains he would be due to make his debut against Real Madrid on the weekend of October 25. Meanwhile, Xavi returned to Barcelona training on Thursday without resolving his future. The 34-year-old was expected to announce his departure to join New York City but he has yet to be fully convinced it is the right step for him. Offers have been flooding in, but as it stands, he will stay at Barcelona for now. He is uncomfortable with the idea of joining Frank Lampard and David Villa in their stint at Melbourne ahead of New York and is considering seeing how the season pans out before taking up City's offer at a later date. He still has two years left on contract and would need a pay-off of around £6m to £8m to go now. In limbo: The future of Barcelona captain Xavi Hernandez remains unclear .

chatgpt: Football star Luis Suarez has been banned from all 'football-related activities' for four months due to an incident that happened during the 2014 World Cup. Suarez was accused of biting his opponent, Italy's Giorgio Chiellini, and was subsequently banned from playing in any football matches or participating in any football-related activities. The incident happened during Uruguay's pivotal match against Italy, with the scores tied at 0-0. Suarez and Chiellini clashed in the penalty area, with footage showing Suarez biting Chiellini on the shoulder before falling to the ground. The match continued, with Uruguay scoring the winning goal shortly after. Since then, Suarez has completed a £75million move to Barcelona from Liverpool, and his appeal against the ban is set to be heard at the Court of Arbitration for Sport in August. Barcelona remains confident that the ban will be reduced to exclude international matches, thus allowing Suarez to play for them in league games. The ban has been a point of great controversy among football fans and commentators alike. Some have argued that the punishment is too severe, while others believe that Suarez deserved a harsher sentence for his repeated biting incidents. The ban will mean that Suarez cannot play any football until November, and it is unclear whether he will be able to play for Uruguay in their qualifying matches for the 2016 World Cup. In response to the ban, Suarez issued a statement in which he apologized for his actions and expressed his regret for any harm he had caused to Chiellini or the wider football community. He acknowledged that biting was unacceptable behavior and promised to work on his anger management issues. The incident has once again brought the issue of sportsmanship into the public eye, with many people debating where the line should be drawn between aggressive play and unsportsmanlike conduct. Regardless of the outcome of Suarez's appeal, it seems likely that the debate will continue to rage on among football fans for some time to come. Overall, Suarez's ban has been a major talking point in the world of football, and it remains to be seen what the future holds for one of the sport's most controversial figures.
