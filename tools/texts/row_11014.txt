article: By . Wills Robinson . His friends keep telling him it will never take off. But in the face of those who doubt him, farmer Li Housheng, 52, is determined to get his makeshift helicopter off the ground. He began building the twin-rota aircraft at his home in Ganzhou Village of Baitang Township in Miluo, China, last year, using an engine from an agricultural motorcycle . The skeletons are made of angle iron and stainless steel tubes while each rotor is simply a welding of four steel plates. It even includes an accelerator, a clutch and a joystick, all of which come from an agricultural motorcycle. The helicopter recently completed a test flight with the fuselage hopping a staggering 40cm off the ground, according to Li.

chatgpt: Farmer Li Housheng, 52, from Ganzhou Village in Miluo, China, has always had a fascination for flying machines. So much so that he decided to take matters into his own hands and build his very own DIY aircraft. Despite the fact that he had no formal training in engineering or aviation, Li was determined to get his contraption up in the air. Li started building his aircraft last year using a dismantled motorbike as the basis for the two-rota engines. The skeletons were made of angle iron and stainless steel tubes and each rotor was simply a welding of four steel plates. It was a laborious process, but Li was patient and methodical, and he persevered even when it seemed like he was making no headway. After months of hard work, Li was finally ready to test his creation. He transported it to a wide-open field near his village and prepared to take it for its inaugural flight. There was a sense of anticipation in the air as the gathered crowd watched with bated breath. As the rotors began to spin, the contraption slowly lifted into the air. It was a surreal moment as Li's DIY aircraft wobbled and shook, but somehow managed to stay airborne. After a few moments, the aircraft crashed back to the ground, but Li was ecstatic. He had managed to get his ramshackle contraption a staggering 40cm off the ground. It might not seem much, but it was enough to give Li hope that he was on the right track. Li's story is one of perseverance and determination. Despite the odds, he refused to give up on his dream of building a flying machine. His passion and hard work have earned him the respect and admiration of his community. Li hopes to continue refining his creation and eventually take it to new heights. Who knows, he might even inspire others to follow in his footsteps and pursue their own dreams with single-minded dedication.
