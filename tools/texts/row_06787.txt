Their bags are adored by women but it seems British heritage brand Mulberry has designs on the wardrobes of the nation's men too. The brand has announced that it is to launch an capsule collection to be sold exclusively on luxury men's fashion site, Mr Porter. Included in the collection, which focuses on accessories, are sturdy leather-trimmed canvas holdalls, in cornflower blue, black and dove grey, and chic messenger bags. Exclusive: This £595 small canvas and leather holdall is part of the collection to be sold on Mr Porter .

Guests at London's Café Royal dined on Scottish lobster, veal with bubble and squeak and an apple and chocolate pudding, before being given an exclusive sneak peek of the collection. The new collaboration is the latest in a series of coups for the heritage brand, which was founded in 1971 by Roger Saul. Despite the departure of the label's enormously successful former creative director Emma Hill, the brand is powering ahead and is proving particularly popular with shoppers from the Far East.

The brand also secured model-of-the-moment Cara Delevingne for its autumn/winter campaign which was shot on location at a crumbling Oxfordshire manor.
