article: Washington (CNN) -- A pilot in Minnesota who was preparing to fly a commercial jet halfway across the country was arrested after a security agent smelled alcohol on him and he failed a preliminary breath test, airport police said Friday. The arrest of Kolbjorn Jarle Kristiansen, 48, happened Friday morning as American Eagle Flight 4590 was preparing to take off from Minneapolis-St. Paul International for LaGuardia Airport in New York. Officers and a Transportation Security Administration agent "detected the odor of a consumed alcohol beverage as they passed by Kristiansen waiting to enter the elevator," according to a Minneapolis/St. Paul International Airport Police Department report. The pilot was taken to a hospital for blood tests, airport spokesman Patrick Hogan told CNN. He was released to airline personnel and charges are pending, according to the airport police report. Fifty-three passengers were scheduled to be on board the Bombardier CRJ700 regional jet for the flight. However, Hogan said none were aboard at the time of the arrest. "American Eagle has a well-established substance abuse policy that is designed to put the safety of our customers and employees first," American Airlines spokesman Matt Miller told CNN in a written statement. "We are cooperating with authorities and conducting a full internal investigation." The pilot is being withheld from service until the investigation is completed, he said. Flight 4590 eventually arrived in New York, with a different crew at the controls, nearly 2Â½ hours late, according to American Airlines' website. FAA regulations say, "No person may act or attempt to act as a crewmember of a civil aircraft ... within eight hours after the consumption of any alcoholic beverage," and a pilot's blood alcohol concentration is limited to .04%. For comparison, drivers are often limited to the higher .08%. More: Suspected drunk pilot kept off Omaha flight . More: Pilot sentences for being drunk while flying .

chatgpt: A regional jet, the Bombardier CRJ700, was scheduled to fly from Minneapolis-St. Paul airport to New York with a pilot who was later taken to the hospital for blood testing. The incident resulted in the pilot being withheld from work, and a new crew was brought in to fly the aircraft to its final destination.  The airline confirmed that the flight arrived almost 2 ½ hours late in New York with an entirely different crew than originally scheduled. The delays caused inconvenience and frustration for passengers who were expecting to arrive at their destination on time.  The airline stated that they are cooperating with the authorities and conducting a full internal investigation to determine what led up to the pilot being taken to the hospital. The airline did not speculate on the health condition of the pilot or the reasons behind the blood testing.  Aviation experts indicate that airline pilots are subject to rigorous health and safety checks before being allowed to operate a commercial aircraft. This includes a comprehensive medical examination and drug and alcohol testing before each flight. It is standard protocol for a pilot to be removed from duty if there is any suspicion of illness or impairment.  This incident highlights the importance of maintaining stringent safety protocols in the aviation industry to ensure the safety of passengers and crew. Airlines take the health and safety of their employees very seriously and have implemented various measures to ensure that pilots are physically and mentally fit to operate an aircraft.  The airline has not released any further details about the incident, but passengers who were affected by the flight delay due to the crew change could be entitled to compensation under airline consumer protection regulations. Passengers are advised to check with the airline for any potential compensation and to monitor their flight status in case of any further changes or delays.  Overall, the situation has raised concerns about the well-being of pilots and the rigorous health and safety checks they undergo before being allowed to fly. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of maintaining strict safety regulations in the aviation industry.
