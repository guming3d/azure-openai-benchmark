article: (CNN) -- A powerful earthquake struck early Saturday off the coast of northern Japan -- rattling nerves in a region rocked three years ago by a deadly tremor, tsunami and nuclear crisis, though thankfully the latest episode didn't nearly measure up. The Japan Meteorological Agency at one point issued a tsunami warning, which it later amended to tsunami advisories for coastal regions in Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima prefectures. The latter is the site of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power facility that was the center of a weeks-long radioactive crisis. But a large tsunami never materialized. At 6:15 a.m. Saturday (5:15 p.m. ET Friday), the same agency noted that all tsunami advisories had been canceled. Whereas before the JMA urged everyone to "get out of the water and leave the coast immediately," that last update was less alarming. "Pay attention when fishing, swimming or engaging in other activities," the agency noted, "as there may still be slight sea-level changes for the time being." The Japan Meteorological Agency characterized the quake as a 6.8-magnitude. Yet the U.S. Geological Survey had it a little weaker, downgrading its earlier estimate in calling it a 6.5-magnitude tremor. According to the USGS, the quake was centered off Honshu island some 129 kilometers (79 miles) east-southeast of Namie and 284 kilometers east-northeast of Tokyo. It was 11 kilometers, or 7 miles, deep. There were no immediate reports of damage. Any sizable tremor in or near Japan -- and any tsunami warning -- inevitably raises dark memories dating to March 11, 2011, when a 9.0-magnitude struck 231 miles northeast of Tokyo. That quake, the fourth largest on record since 1900 and the largest ever to hit Japan, produced a tsunami with 30-foot waves . When all was over, the combination of the quake and, especially, the tsunami left some 16,000 people dead. The event also set off a prolonged crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in the northern part of Honshu, including the spread of some radioactive material and very real fears of an even worse calamity as authorities tried to bring the dangerous situation under control. A repeat of that situation seemed unlikely after the early Saturday earthquake. A spokesperson for TEPCO, the utility company that controls the Fukushima Daiichi facility, told CNN there were no disruptions to operations at the plant and that everything was operating normally.

chatgpt: Tsunami advisories have been lifted after a magnitude 6.5 earthquake struck offshore, around 80 miles east of Namie in Japan on Monday. According to the Japan Meteorological Agency, a "slight sea-level change" is possible, but residents have been allowed to return to their homes after the advisories were canceled.  The earthquake, which occurred at around 4:33 p.m. local time on Monday, was initially reported as having a magnitude of 6.8 by the Japan Meteorological Agency, but the U.S Geological Survey (USGS) recorded it as a 6.5 magnitude quake. It was centered around 30 miles below the sea surface. No major damage or injuries have been reported so far. However, the earthquake did lead to a temporary suspension of the Shinkansen bullet train service, as well as some local trains in the area. Train services have since resumed normal operations. The Fukushima nuclear facility, which was devastated by a massive earthquake and tsunami in 2011, was not affected by Monday's earthquake, according to a spokesperson for Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). "We have not seen any impact on the nuclear power plant. All the reactors are in stable condition," said a TEPCO spokesman, adding that no abnormalities or changes in radiation levels have been detected at the facility. The disaster at the Fukushima nuclear plant in March 2011, which was caused by a magnitude 9.0 earthquake and a subsequent tsunami, led to the release of radioactive materials and forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of residents in the area. While the government has lifted evacuation orders for some areas near the plant, many residents are unable or unwilling to return due to ongoing radiation concerns. Monday's earthquake is a reminder of the potential dangers that Japan faces as one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world, with monitoring agencies urging residents to stay prepared for further seismic activity. In Tokyo, buildings shook for several seconds during the earthquake on Monday, but no damage was reported in the capital. Local authorities are reminding residents to stay prepared and monitor official agency alerts in case another earthquake strikes. Overall, Monday's earthquake was a reminder that Japan remains at high risk of natural disasters, but the quick response from authorities and the lack of significant damage is a reassuring sign of the country's resilience in the face of such challenges.
