Luisa Rodrigues, the suspect's widow, claimed DNA had cleared the heroin addict . ‘He was told they were looking for a tall black man who had broken into country homes and sexually assaulted children inside. ‘He denied any involvement in the indecent assaults. Police did DNA tests at the time and ruled him out as a suspect and apologised for troubling him. ‘They never mentioned Madeleine McCann. Until the day he died the police never contacted him again.’ Memorial: Seven years after her disappearance, low-key tributes were paid to Madeleine during a service in Rothley, Leicestershire .

chatgpt: The investigation into the disappearance of a woman, who vanished over a decade ago, has taken a dramatic turn after her former colleague was quizzed about a series of attacks. Euclides Monteiro was questioned by British police about the attacks, which occurred a year after the female victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, disappeared. Monteiro’s widow, Lusia Rodrigues, has come forward to defend her late husband, stating that DNA evidence found at the scene of the attacks absolves him of any wrongdoing. Rodrigues claims that there was a mix-up in the DNA database and that the heroin addict was wrongly implicated in the case. According to Rodrigues, Monteiro had a solid alibi for the time period during which the attacks took place, and she is confident that he had nothing to do with them. The attacks in question were sexual assaults on women, and the police had been trying to identify the perpetrator for several years. The attacker struck at least 18 times, causing significant concern amongst the local community. The investigation had stalled until recent developments brought Monteiro back into the spotlight. The case has taken a further twist, with Rodrigues revealing that she was also questioned by detectives this year. She admits that two detectives had visited her in connection with her husband’s possible involvement in the attacks. However, she maintains that her husband was not responsible for them and that she has no information that could assist in the investigation. The police have not commented on the case, stating that it is an ongoing investigation and that they are following all leads. They have said that the case remains open and that they are committed to bringing the perpetrator to justice. The disappearance of the victim is still unsolved, and it is unknown if there is any connection between her disappearance and the attacks that occurred the following year. However, the investigation continues, and the police are hopeful that new leads will emerge in the case. The case has gripped the local community, and many are anxious for a resolution. The victim’s family is still seeking closure, and the recent developments have renewed their hope that justice will be served.
