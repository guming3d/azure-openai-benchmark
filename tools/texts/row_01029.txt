article: The teenager who stabbed his teacher to death in a brutal classroom killing is getting 'fanmail' from deluded youngsters, it emerged today. Mixed-up teenagers have gone online to praise Will Cornick, the murderer of Spanish teacher Ann Maguire, and he is reportedly being sent letters from admiring peers. Some youngsters have even used the term 'good times' - the words uttered by Cornick in the moments after his horrific attack - as a sickening catchphrase. Will Cornick (left) was jailed for at least 20 years for the murder of teacher Ann Maguire (right). He is now reportedly receiving 'fanmail' after youngsters praised him online . Cornick, 16, has been jailed for a minimum of 20 years for the murder of the popular teacher at Corpus Christi College in Leeds in April this year. But a Facebook group set up in his name has seen some teenage girls claim they find the 16-year-old killer attractive. After website users attacked Cornick, one girl wrote: 'Calm down. I love Will!!!' in a comment that was then 'liked' by a friend. In another 'liked' comment, a schoolgirl wrote: 'He's so buff.' When asked what she meant, she replied: 'Good looking.' One girl even repeated the phrase Cornick used after he stabbed his teacher, writing  'good times' on the page, followed by a thumbs up symbol. Again, her comment was 'liked' by others. Cornick's own Facebook page (pictured) has been taken down, but 'community pages' with comments about him have sprung up since his sentencing . The killing, atÂ Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds, shocked Britain and is believed to be the first time a teacher has been killed by a student in the classroom in the UK . Another message on the page comes from an Italian girl who is trying to get in contact with Cornick,  saying she feels 'sorry for' him and describing him as a 'friend'. The online comments emerged as it was reported that Cornick has received messages from teenagers around the world as he begins his prison term. The Daily Star quoted a source close to the case who claimed: 'He is getting letters from boys and girls from England, the US and Australia. Some are from girls saying he is cute and they want to marry him.' Cornick was sentenced to life in jail earlier this month and a judge warned him he may never be released. Judge Mr Justice Coulson called the murder a 'monumental act of cowardice and evil' and branded the teenager's pride and lack of remorse over his actions 'truly grotesque'. Cornick was initially taken to Wetherby Young Offender Institution (YOI) in West Yorkshire before being moved for his own safety.

chatgpt: In a shocking classroom attack that took place in April, Cornick brutally murdered his teacher, Mrs Maguire. He was widely condemned for his heinous crime and earlier this month, he was jailed for life with a minimum term of 20 years. The judge also made it clear that there is a possibility that Cornick might never be released. Despite the severity of the crime committed by Cornick, it has come to light that some youngsters are surprisingly praising him online. In addition to this, it has been reported that he is receiving fan mail while he serves his sentence in prison. The revelation that some youngsters are praising the killer is surely a shock to many. It is understood that these youths are expressing support on various social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit. This has sparked a wave of horror and disbelief among parents, teachers and the general public alike. It is disheartening to see such a reaction in the society, as praise for someone who has committed such a heinous crime is never justified. It is important to remember that Mrs Maguire was more than just a teacher to her students; she was a wife, mother, and friend, who was taken from her loved ones in the most brutal way possible. Furthermore, reports that Cornick is receiving fan mail are equally concerning. It is unfathomable that anyone could consider someone who murdered an innocent person to be deserving of admiration or support. This certainly raises questions about the mental and moral state of these individuals who find inspiration and entertainment in such gruesome acts. It should be emphasized that there is no place in our society for those who celebrate acts of violence and disregard human life. Rather, we should come together to offer support and comfort to those affected by such tragedies. It is important to remember the victims and their families, as they are the ones who truly deserve our empathy and consideration. In conclusion, the classroom attack carried out by Cornick was a horrific event that left a lasting impact on the victim's family, students and society as a whole. The fact that some individuals are now praising his actions is alarming and unsettling. It is a clear indication that we must continue to address the deeper issues that lead to such violent behavior and work tirelessly to prevent such instances from happening again.
