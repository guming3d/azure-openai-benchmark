Operators of Japan's stricken Fukushima nuclear power plant lost the ability to cool radioactive fuel rods in one of its reactors for three hours today after workers tripped the power supply while trying to ward off rats. It was the second failure of the system to circulate seawater to cool spent fuel rods at the plant in the past three weeks. Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco) said it was alerted by an alarm that the cooling system for the No 3 reactor had shut down at around 2.27pm (5.27am GMT) after a power board failed. Safety alert: Workers at Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant lost the ability to cool fuel rods in reactor 3 (seen here after the earthquake in 2011) after tripping the power supply while setting up a rat trap . Crippled: The plant was the site of the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in March 2011 when a magnitude-9 earthquake triggered a tsunami that destroyed back-up generators at Fukushima . Technicians fixed the problem by about 5.20pm, the utility said. Tepco said workers appeared to have had inadvertently caused the power outage when they were trying to install a net to keep small animals from crawling into the reactor building. A rat caused a power outage at Fukushima last month when it triggered a circuit breaker by bumping into exposed wires. In that case, the cooling system was shut down for almost a day. Workers appeared to have had inadvertently caused the power outage when they were trying to install a net to keep small animals from crawling into the reactor building . The utility has faced a range of problems with controlling ground water and maintaining the massive cooling system built to keep the reactors stable. The plant was the site of the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in March 2011 when a magnitude-9 earthquake triggered a tsunami that destroyed back-up generators at Fukushima and disabled the plant's cooling system. Three of the reactors melted down. Work to decommission the plant is projected to take decades to complete.

chatgpt: At approximately 2:27 PM local time (5:27 AM GMT) today, the cooling system at a Japanese nuclear power plant experienced a second failure in the past three weeks. The cause of the latest incident was workers accidentally cutting the power supply while installing a net to protect the plant from animals. The incident occurred at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, which made headlines in 2011 when a major earthquake and tsunami led to a nuclear disaster at the plant. The recent failures of the cooling system have raised concerns about the safety of Japan's nuclear plants and the potential risks associated with the aging technology. The latest incident resulted in the cooling system going down for three hours, which meant the plant was unable to reduce the heat generated by the nuclear reactors. The plant operators reported that there were no major safety concerns and that the plant remained stable during the outage. Although there was no immediate danger, the incident has fueled concerns about the safety of Japan's nuclear power plants. The government has vowed to bolster safety measures at the Fukushima Daiichi plant and other nuclear plants in the country. The latest failure also highlights the challenges related to the effort to decommission the plant, which is expected to take several decades. The Fukushima disaster shook the world in 2011, causing widespread damage and leading to mass evacuations. While the latest incident may not be as serious, it reveals the ongoing challenges associated with nuclear energy and the need for continued vigilance to ensure the safety of these plants. Japan is one of the world's leading users of nuclear energy, making up about 30% of the total electricity used in the country. Although the government has committed to reducing its reliance on nuclear power in the wake of the Fukushima disaster, the country remains heavily reliant on the technology. The latest incident at the Fukushima Daiichi plant serves as a reminder of the importance of safety and the need to remain vigilant in the face of potential risks. As the world continues to grapple with the challenges associated with nuclear energy, it is clear that safety must always be the top priority in order to prevent further disasters.
