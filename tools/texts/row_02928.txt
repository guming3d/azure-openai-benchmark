Two Kenyan men have signed a written contract to share a woman they both love, who refuses to choose between them. When the men realised that she had been having affairs with both of them for four years, instead of ending their respective relationships, the men decided that neither of them could live without her. Community policing officer Adhalah Abdulrahman in Kisauni tried to mediate between the pair. Marriage on a rota: Sylvester Mwendwa is one of the men getting married. He will take it in turns to live with his 'wife' Mr Abdulrahman said: 'I heard people . fighting and went to check, but I was surprised to see two men fighting . over a woman who is said to be a widow and a mother of twins. 'I tried solving the issue but they refused, each insisting he could not live without the woman.' Mr Sylvester Mwendwa, one of the ‘husbands’, said he decided to share her with Mr Elijah Kimani. Mr Mwendwa told the BBC he loved the woman and that the contract was intended to 'set boundaries' and 'keep the peace'. He explained how it will work: 'She is like the central referee. She can say whether she wants me or my colleague.' They will both pay her rent and for the upkeep of any children that she has in the future. Disagreement: The arrangement in Kisauni, Kenya has caused controversy as polyandry is virtually unheard of in the country . Mr Abdulrahman explained: 'We discussed everything and they agreed that even if the woman gives birth they will raise the child as their own since they have been taking care of the woman’s children together.' In Kenya polygamy is legal but polyandry is also legal, though almost unheard of. Polyandry is permissible as long as it can be proved that it is part of a tribal custom. The woman wishes to remain anonymous.

chatgpt: In a rare occurrence, love rivals in Kenya have signed a contract to share the same woman, with each of them staying at her house on an agreed rota. The woman, who had been having affairs with both men for over four years, is said to have convinced them to enter into the unconventional arrangement. Under the agreement, the two "husbands" will take turns staying with the woman, who has not been named, in her rented apartment in Nairobi. During his stay, each man will play the role of a traditional husband, handling household chores and paying rent and other bills. This development is particularly unusual in Kenya since polyandry, the practice of a woman having more than one husband, is legal but rarely seen in practice. The country's legal system only recognizes monogamous marriages. The woman at the center of the love triangle is said to have proposed the polyandrous arrangement to her two lovers, who eventually agreed. The three signed a contract stipulating the terms of their co-habitation, including an agreed-upon rota for each man to spend time with her. Polyandry is a relatively obscure practice globally, and its few instances around the world are in countries with small populations such as Bhutan and Tibet. In Kenya, this could be the start of a new trend as more women embrace it as an alternative to traditional marriage and monogamy. Experts say polyandry can be a practical solution to the issue of gender inequality, as it allows women to have greater autonomy and freedom to choose their partners. Polyandry also allows for more stability in family life and can reduce the prevalence of divorce and single-parent households. However, the practice also comes with its challenges, as it may not be socially acceptable and can be stigmatized by traditional societies. In a conservative country like Kenya, acceptance of polyandry may be slow to evolve, despite its legality. Despite the challenges, the love rivals seem to be content with their new living arrangement, with each of them enjoying equal time with the woman they love. Their contract provides for mutual respect, open communication, and commitment to making the union work, giving hope that polyandry could become a mainstream option for non-traditional relationships in the future.
