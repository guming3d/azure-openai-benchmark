article: Shopping for clothing has always been something of a hit-and-miss affair for men. Finding the perfect attire usually requires patience, luck and several frustrating hours behind a changing room curtain. But the process could soon become a lot simpler thanks to a German firm fitting photo booth-like body scanners in train stations and even airports. The machine is fitted with a 3D scanner that works by taking thousands of detailed body measurements before customers can order clothes. The device can be used to produce everything from underwear through to shoes completely made-to-measure. Scroll down for video . Outfittery has been fitting photo booth-like body scanners in train stations and even airports for men . The scanner project by the firm 'Outfittery,' based in the German capital Berlin, came about after it was revealed that many men do not even really know what size of clothing they are and as a result are put off ordering online. 'We want to create a stress free shopping experience for men, and their partners, and it has proved incredibly popular, said Julia Bosch, who founded Outfittery, with Anna Alex and Tobias Nendel. The 3D scan takes thousands of body measurements in a matter of minutes which can be used to create clothing . The 3D image, which is created inside the booth (pictured right), of the customers body is then used to created made-to-measure clothing . The machine will also give men clothing suggestions based on their measurements . People only need to say what items they like the look of, and we will deliver them made-to-measure.' The company says its returns for items that do not fit are almost non-existent, making the service more efficient and wastes less time for customers and company. Company spokesperson Alex Keil explained: 'So often men don't know their exact sizes but this new scanner measures them exactly and that means we can choose clothes that we know will fit our clients. 'Our clothes experts know what will fit if they have proper data, and this scanner produces 100 percent pure data - it cannot lie.' 'We are planning on making 20 such scanners and placing them in train stations and airports in the countries in which we operate. 'When thinking about where to place them we thought 'Where does an entire population pass through in a year?' and we realised these transport hubs were perfect'.' The company is currently operating in eight European countries, and looking to expand next to Scandinavia and later this year into the UK.

chatgpt: German-based company Outfittery has fitted 3D body scanners at train stations and airports across the country. The scanner works by taking thousands of detailed measurements of the body, and the technology is set to revolutionize the way people shop for clothes. The company uses the measurements taken by the scanner to produce a range of clothing items, including underwear, suits, and even shoes, which are all made-to-measure. The new technology promises to take the stress out of shopping, particularly for men who often lack the patience for shopping or struggle to find clothing items that fit perfectly. "We want to make shopping easy and enjoyable for our customers," says Outfittery CEO, Julia Bösch. "Our 3D body scanning technology means that we can provide custom-fitted clothing that is not just comfortable but also fits perfectly." Customers can visit the scanner at any of the Outfittery locations, including train stations and airports, where they will be directed to stand in front of the scanner. The device uses a combination of cameras and laser sensors to create a detailed, 3D image of the customer's body. The measurements taken are so precise that the clothing produced from them fits like a glove. Outfittery has been working with manufacturers to create clothing items that are not only comfortable and stylish but also practical. The company has worked with leading fashion brands to create a range of clothing items that can be worn for any occasion, including weddings, work, and casual wear. The benefits of the scanner extend beyond just convenience; the technology also has significant environmental benefits. By producing clothing that is made-to-measure, Outfittery is reducing the amount of waste that is created in the fashion industry. Many clothing items that are produced in bulk end up going unsold, meaning they are often thrown away, leading to significant amounts of waste. "We're committed to reducing waste in the fashion industry," says Bösch. "By using 3D body scanning technology, we can produce clothing that is made-to-measure, thus reducing the amount of waste produced by the fashion industry." The innovation behind Outfittery's 3D body scanning technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we shop for clothes. By ensuring that every item of clothing is produced to fit an individual's exact measurements, the company has succeeded in creating a more environmentally friendly and customer-focused approach to fashion.
