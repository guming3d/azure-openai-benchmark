chatgpt: An altercation in a bar in a popular resort town of the UK has left an 18-year-old boy in intensive care. Declan McNulty was stabbed in the stomach following an argument, according to reports. The incident comes just two weeks after another stabbing in the same resort town, which left Callum Copson with life-threatening injuries. Police were called to the scene after the altercation broke out in the bar. Witnesses reported seeing McNulty arguing with another individual before the situation escalated to violence. It is believed that McNulty was stabbed during the altercation, resulting in severe injuries to his stomach. The incident has sparked concerns about the safety of the resort town, which has seen a spate of violent incidents in recent weeks. Two weeks ago, a similar incident left Copson battling for his life after he was stabbed by an unknown attacker. He is currently receiving treatment in the same hospital as McNulty. Police have launched an investigation into the two incidents and are appealing for anyone with information to come forward. Detective Inspector John Smithson, who is leading the investigation, said: "These two incidents are deeply concerning and we are working hard to identify those responsible. We would urge anyone who has any information about either incident to come forward and speak to us as soon as possible." The local community has also expressed its concerns about the recent spate of violent incidents in the resort town. Local councillor, Jane Brown, said: "The recent incidents in the town have left us all deeply concerned. We need to see action taken to address the root causes of these incidents and ensure that the town is safe for residents and visitors alike." The incidents have also reignited the debate about knife crime in the UK. With an increase in knife crime across the country, there have been calls for tougher laws to prevent such incidents from occurring. Politicians from all parties have weighed in on the issue, with many calling for more resources to be allocated to tackling the problem. Meanwhile, McNulty's family is said to be devastated by the incident. Speaking to reporters, McNulty's mother said: "We are just praying that he pulls through. It's been a terrible shock for us all and we just want to see him recover as soon as possible." As the investigation continues, police are urging anyone with information about the incidents to come forward. With concerns growing about the safety of the resort town, it is essential that action is taken to prevent further incidents from occurring and ensure the safety of the local community.
