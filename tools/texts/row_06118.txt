chatgpt: Michael Marin, the father of four who was convicted of burning down his mansion in Phoenix, Arizona, collapsed and died in court after he appeared to put something in his mouth on Thursday. The 53-year-old former Wall Street banker was awaiting sentencing after being found guilty of arson in 2009. Marin was seen holding his head in his hands as the verdict was announced. When the jury left the room, he appeared to swallow something and went into convulsions. Medical personnel rushed to his aid while the court was cleared. Marin was taken to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead later in the day. The cause of Marin's death is not yet known, and toxicology tests have been ordered. However, his collapse came just moments after he was found guilty of burning down his $3.5 million mansion in Biltmore Estates. During the trial, fire investigators testified that Marin had started the fire in 2009 before escaping down a rope ladder wearing a full scuba-diving suit. Marin claimed that he had escaped the fire by jumping from the second-story window, but forensic evidence contradicted this claim. Prosecutors argued that Marin burned down his mansion to collect insurance money, which he used to pay off his debts. Marin had previously worked as a bond trader for several Wall Street firms, including Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers, but was unemployed at the time of the fire. The trial lasted for five weeks, and Marin faced up to 16 years in prison if he had been sentenced to the maximum term. Marin's collapse in court shocked both his family and the legal community. Marin was a well-known figure in Phoenix, and his case had drawn national attention. He was described as an avid collector of art and antiques and was known for his lavish lifestyle. In a statement, his family said they were "devastated by the loss of their beloved Michael" and asked for privacy during this difficult time. The judge in the case, Bruce Cohen, expressed his condolences to Marin's family, saying that his death was a tragedy. He also praised Marin's defense team for their hard work and dedication during the trial. The cause of Michael Marin's death is still unknown, and toxicology tests are pending. However, his dramatic collapse in court will be remembered as a shocking moment in Arizona's legal history.
