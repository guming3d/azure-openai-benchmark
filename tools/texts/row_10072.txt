The study has found there is no long-term employment advantages for private school students, with public school graduates earning just as much in equally prominent jobs.

A Canberra University research fellow, Jenny Chesters, found that even though private school students were more likely to attend prestigious Australian universities, it would not lead to a higher income . 'If a parent wants to pay to send their child to a private school, I don't have a problem with that but they should know that if they think paying for an education is an investment and you will get a monetary return on it, you probably won't,' Dr Chesters told the Sydney Morning Herald. The basis of the study analysed data from the Melbourne Institute's Househould Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia report. Dr Chesters examined data for more than 2,000 people aged between 24 to 35 in 2012. About 70 percent went to public schools, while 17 percent attended Catholic schools and 13.5 percent to independent schools. While the students more likely to have graduated from high school in year 12 attended Catholic or independent schools, public school students were not disadvantaged when it came to getting a high paying job out of university. 'There has been an explosion in independent schools since (former Prime Minister) John Howard changed the funding formula so, if you are aged 25 to 34, an independent school is a very different place than it was if you are 45,' Dr Chester said. Dr Chesters examined data for more than 2,000 people aged between 24 to 35 in 2012 .

chatgpt: A study conducted by researchers at the Canberra University has found that there is no long-term employment advantage for students who attend private schools. The study, led by research fellow Jenny Chesters, involved examining data from over 2,000 individuals aged between 24-35 years old. Ms. Chesters found that public school students were not at a disadvantage when it came to securing high-paying jobs. This is a significant finding in a world where economic inequality and disparities in educational opportunities are often hotly debated topics. The study goes against the common assumption that private school students have an advantage over their peers in the job market. This assumption is often based on the belief that private schools have better resources and curriculums that give their students an edge when it comes to getting into prestigious universities and eventually securing top jobs. However, the study found that even though private school students may have some advantages initially, there is no long-term benefit when it comes to employment outcomes. Ms. Chesters stated that this was an important finding, as it challenges some of the commonly held assumptions about the link between private education and employment outcomes. The study also highlights the importance of ensuring that all students have access to high-quality education, regardless of their socioeconomic background. This is especially relevant as governments around the world strive to address inequalities in access to education and employment opportunities. It is worth noting that this study is only one piece in the puzzle when it comes to understanding the complex relationship between education and employment outcomes. Nevertheless, it provides valuable insights into a topic that is of great interest to policymakers, educators, and the wider society. In conclusion, a Canberra University study has found that private school students do not have a long-term employment advantage over their public school counterparts. This is an important finding that challenges some common assumptions about the relationship between education and employment outcomes. The study highlights the need for equitable access to high-quality education to ensure fair employment opportunities for all.
