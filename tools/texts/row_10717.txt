article: (CNN) -- Trader Joe's has alerted its customers about the recall of products with a cilantro ingredient that may cause a serious foodborne illness. In some cases, the affected items are specific to certain states. For example, the 12-ounce, Spicy Thai Style Pasta Salad (sku 74441), was recalled by APPA Fine Foods, which supplied the product to California Trader Joe's, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. The pasta salad, which has sell-by dates of October 31 through November 6, contains cilantro that may be contaminated with salmonella, the government said. The packages bear the establishment number "P-21030" within the USDA mark of inspection. There have been no reports of any illnesses so far, CNN affiliate KTLA reported. Symptoms of salmonella poisoning can include fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramping. Those with weak immune systems, like infants and the elderly, are the most susceptible. Trader Joe's also voluntarily recalled the following products it says should not be consumed due to the potential for "serious foodborne illness." The company did not describe the illness: . All stores: Cilantro Dressing (sku 36420) with a sell-by date of February 9, 2011; Spicy Peanut Vinaigrette (sku 80947) with a sell-by date of January 9, 2011. California, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon and Washington only: Cilantro Pecan Dip (sku 76986) with sell-by dates of November 20 and November 24. As a precaution, all codes of the products have been removed from sale and destroyed, Trader Joe's said. The chain advises customers to dispose of the affected products or return them to any store location for a full refund.

chatgpt: Californian health officials are warning consumers of salmonella contamination found in a specific product sold in several stores across the state. The California Department of Public Health recently alerted Californian residents that the product in question may be contaminated with salmonella. The strain of salmonella identified is known to cause severe illness and can potentially lead to hospitalization. The product in question remains unnamed by state health officials, but has been found in multiple stores. According to the alert, the product is also sold in other states and nationally. The officials are advising consumers to carefully check their refrigerators and dispose of any products that may be linked to the contamination. This announcement comes on the heels of an investigation centered on a recent outbreak of salmonella in California. The investigation, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), identified around 75 cases in the state of California alone. Many of these cases were linked to a specific type of sesame seeds. It is unclear if the recent alert issued by the California Department of Public Health is related to the broader investigation. Salmonella is a type of bacteria that can cause illness in both humans and animals. It affects the intestinal tract and causes symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and fever. In more severe cases, salmonella can lead to hospitalization and even death in young children, elderly people, and those with weakened immune systems. As a general precaution, consumers are advised to always carefully check the expiration dates on any products they purchase, and make sure to handle and prepare food according to recommended safety guidelines. If you believe you may have consumed contaminated food, it is recommended to seek medical attention as soon as possible.
