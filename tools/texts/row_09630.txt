article: New York (CNN) --  Two people have died and 28 people have fallen ill with matching strains of E. coli after an outbreak in ground beef, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Sixteen of those people are in hospitals and three have developed kidney failure as a result of the contamination, the CDC said late Monday. The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced last week that Fairbank Farms in Ashville, New York, was recalling more than half a million pounds of fresh ground beef products that may be contaminated with a strain of E. coli, a potentially deadly species of bacteria. The products subject to recall were sent to retailers including Trader Joe's, Price Chopper, Lancaster and Wild Harvest, Shaw's, BJ's, Ford Brothers, and Giant Food Stores. The exact products affected are listed on the USDA's Web site. The recall was for distribution centers in eight states, but Fairbank Farms said some retailers may have sent the affected beef to other states. Each package is printed with "EST. 492" inside the USDA mark of inspection or on the nutrition label. They were packaged on September 15 and 16 and may have been labeled at the retail stores with a sell-by date from September 19 through 28, the USDA said. Consumers should ask at their point of purchase if the products they have purchased are subject to recall, the USDA said. E. coli can cause bloody diarrhea, dehydration, and in the most severe cases, kidney failure. The very young, seniors and people with weak immune systems are the most susceptible to foodborne illness. The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service advised consumers to safely prepare raw meat products, whether they are fresh or frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit. The only way to be sure ground beef is cooked to a high enough temperature to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer to measure the internal temperature, the FSIS said. Of the 28 people infected with E. coli from the outbreak, eight are in Massachusetts; four each are in Connecticut and New Hampshire; two each are in Maine, Pennsylvania and South Dakota; and one each is in California, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York and Vermont, according to the CDC.

chatgpt: In a tragic turn of events, two people have lost their lives due to an outbreak of E. coli. The bacterium, commonly found in undercooked beef, can cause bloody diarrhea, dehydration, and even kidney failure in severe cases. Health officials have urged the public to take caution and thoroughly cook their beef to prevent such outbreaks. Using a food thermometer to measure the internal temperature of beef is highly recommended, as it ensures that the meat is cooked to a safe temperature that kills any potential bacteria. Symptoms of E. coli infection include stomach cramps, nausea, and vomiting, often followed by bloody diarrhea. Although most people recover within a week, some may develop a more severe infection that can lead to kidney failure and, potentially, death. It is crucial to avoid cross-contamination during food preparation, as E. coli can also be spread through contact with feces or contaminated surfaces, such as cutting boards and utensils. It is essential to wash hands regularly and to thoroughly wash produce before consumption to prevent the spread of the bacteria. Health officials are actively investigating the outbreak to determine the source of the contamination. While it is unclear at this time, they are advising the public to stay vigilant and to report any symptoms of E. coli infection immediately. In the wake of this tragic outbreak, health experts are reminding the public to take necessary precautions to prevent E. coli infection. Proper food handling practices, including thorough cleaning and cooking to a safe temperature, can go a long way in reducing the risk of contamination and preventing the spread of the bacteria. In conclusion, it is crucial to be aware of the potential dangers of E. coli and to take necessary precautions to prevent infection. Health officials advise everyone to use a food thermometer to ensure that beef is cooked to a safe temperature, wash hands regularly, and avoid cross-contamination during food preparation. By taking these steps, we can work together to prevent future outbreaks and protect public health.
