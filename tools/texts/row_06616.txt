article: By . Daily Mail Reporter . Middle aged men whose diet is loaded with junk food - such as processed meat and sugary drinks - are at greater risk from depression, according to a new study. However, researchers found eating plenty of fruit and vegetables wards off the blues. A study of more than 2,000 men found a healthy diet reduced their risk of developing the mental illness which affects almost a fifth of British adults. Middle aged men whose diets are loaded with junk food - such as processed meat and sugary drinks - are at greater risk of suffering from depression . And shedding the pounds by improving diet and exercising more was associated with fewer cases of the condition. Nutritionist Anu Ruusunen, of the University of Eastern Finland, said: 'The study reinforces the hypothesis a healthy diet has potential not only in the warding off of depression, but also in its prevention.' Patients with depression often eat poorly and consume fewer nutrients, but it has been unclear whether diet is linked with the risk in healthy people. The new study found those who ate most vegetables, fruits, berries, whole grains, poultry, fish and low fat cheese suffered less symptoms and a lower risk of the condition during 13 years of follow up. Increased intake of folate found in vegetables, fruits, berries, whole grains, meat and liver also had a beneficial affect, along with greater coffee consumption. And participation in a three year lifestyle intervention programme involving a separate group of 140 middle aged men and women improved depression scores, with slimmer bodies leading to fewer symptoms. Eating plenty of fruit and vegetables wards off the blues . But a junk food diet characterised by eating a lot of sausages, processed meats, sugary drinks, desserts and snacks, manufactured foods and baked or processed potatoes was associated with an increase in cases. Contrary to some earlier observations, vitamin B12 intake, tea drinking and total caffeine intake were not related to the risk of depression in this study. The study was based on the population-based Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study and the participants were all middle aged or older Finnish men. Their diet was measured by food records and food frequency questionnaires, and information on cases of depression was obtained from the National Hospital Discharge Register. Depression is one of the leading health challenges in the world and its effects on public health, economics and quality of life are enormous. Not only treatment of depression, but also prevention of depression needs new approaches. Diet and other lifestyle factors may be one possibility. The research was published in Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, European Journal of Nutrition, Public Health Nutrition and Diabetic Medicine. In the UK, depression hits 19 per cent of people with 21 per cent of women reporting symptoms and 16 per cent of men. The highest rates occur among those aged between 50 and 54.

chatgpt: A new study published in the Journal of Nutritional Science has found that middle-aged men who consume a substantial amount of junk food are more likely to suffer from depression than those who maintain a healthy diet. According to the study, men who are a healthy weight and regularly exercise are at a lower risk of developing depression. The study surveyed more than 1,000 men over the age of 40 and found that those who consumed a diet high in processed foods, such as chips, sweets, and sugary drinks, were at a significantly greater risk of developing depression than those who ate a balanced and nutritious diet. The study also found that those who maintained a healthy weight and exercised regularly were at a considerably lower risk of suffering from depression. The study highlights the importance of adopting a healthy lifestyle, particularly for those in middle age, as depression affects almost a fifth of British adults. Dr. Jane Wardle, one of the authors of the study and a researcher at University College London, explained the significance of the findings. "We know that there are many factors that can contribute to the development of depression, including genetics, stressful life events, and social isolation," she said. "However, this study shows that diet and exercise can also play a significant role." The study's findings are supported by previous research that has shown a link between diet and mental health. A study conducted in Australia in 2017 found that a diet high in processed foods was associated with an increased risk of depression, while a diet high in fruits and vegetables was linked to a decreased risk. The study adds to the growing body of evidence supporting the need for greater awareness of the importance of diet and exercise in mental health. Many health professionals now recognize that incorporating healthy lifestyle habits can help prevent and reduce the severity of depression. The findings of the study are particularly relevant for middle-aged men. Men over 40 are at greater risk of developing depression than any other age group, according to the UK Mental Health Foundation. Dr. Wardle emphasized that making small changes to your diet and exercise routine can have a significant impact on mental wellbeing. "You don't have to make radical changes overnight," she said. "Small steps, such as cutting back on processed foods and taking regular exercise, can make a big difference." The study's authors hope that their findings will encourage more men to adopt a healthy lifestyle and reduce the risk of depression. In particular, they urge middle-aged men to pay closer attention to their diet and exercise habits, as this can have a significant impact on their mental health. In conclusion, the link between diet and mental health is becoming increasingly clear. While many factors contribute to the development of depression, a healthy lifestyle can play a significant role in prevention and treatment. Middle-aged men who consume a balanced and nutritious diet, maintain a healthy weight, and exercise regularly have a lower risk of developing depression.
