article: Boston (CNN) -- What scientists say is the largest concentration of endangered right whales ever spotted in one location is giving researchers an unusually rich opportunity to study the animals and their feeding habits. But the gathering, an annual affair in the chilly spring waters off Cape Cod Bay in Massachusetts, also raises the threat of boats striking the 70-ton mammals, according to the state Division of Marine Fisheries. The agency has posted an advisory to boaters urging them to be on the lookout for the whales and steer clear. Scientists believe that there are only 450 right whales in the world but say the numbers have been slowly recovering since commercial whaling of the species was banned more than 70 years ago. The more than 100 whales counted in the bay this month is the largest number recorded in one place, according to the Provincetown Center for Coastal Studies in Provincetown, Massachusetts. "We're looking at an exceedingly rare animal in unusual numbers in one of their last critical habitats," Charles Mayo, a scientist at the center who studies right whales, said Friday. Why so many in one place? In a word, food, said Mayo. One way or another, the whales caught wind of a unusually rich repast of plankton available in the waters of the bay and arrived to take advantage of the easy dining, Mayo said. The plankton bloom often occurs, but it's been particularly rich and long-lasting this year for unknown reasons, he said. There have been no boat strikes on the many whales contained in the bay's waters, said Dan McKiernan, deputy director of the state Marine Fisheries Division. In fact, the last known fatal strike on a whale in the area happened in 1999, he said. State and federal law makes it a crime to close within 500 yards of a right whale, according to the state Marine Fisheries Division. Seeing so many right whales in the same place is encouraging for researchers, even though they are well aware that the species is on the road to recovery after dipping in the early 1900s to as few as a handful of breeding females and male suitors. It's also a spectacle for the public, Mayo said. The whales feed on the surface and can be seen from shore, he said. "Anytime you see a whale from the beach that's actually alive, it's pretty exciting," he said. The whales should begin trickling out of the bay sometime in the next few days heading for deeper waters offshore, Mayo said.

chatgpt: In a remarkable discovery, scientists have counted a record number of right whales in Cape Cod Bay. Experts say that a rich food source is drawing the whales to the area. According to the researchers, the sighting of 255 right whales in Cape Cod Bay is the highest number ever observed in a single day. This is considered a significant finding, considering that only 450 right whales are known to exist in the world. The population of these whales has plummeted in recent years due to hunting, ship strikes, and entanglements. Therefore, this discovery brings a glimmer of hope. The sighting of the whales is considered good news because it indicates that the whales have found a reliable food source. The scientists speculate that the whales have found an abundance of zooplankton, which is their primary food source. This is an essential finding because the presence of the whales indicates the health of the ecosystem. Researchers say that the high concentration of whales in the Cape Cod Bay does pose a challenge for ships in the area. The North Atlantic right whale is considered one of the most endangered whale species in the world, and vessel strikes are a leading cause of death for these animals. Therefore, efforts need to be made to ensure that there are measures in place to protect the whales from ship collisions. Scientists are closely monitoring the situation, and the discovery will allow them to investigate the feeding patterns of the right whales more closely. Experts say that this information could help inform conservation efforts in the future. The right whale is a vital species in the ocean ecosystem. These whales are considered a cornerstone species, meaning that their presence is critical to the health and stability of the ecosystem. The species also plays an essential role in carbon sequestration, which is the process of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it in ocean sediment. In conclusion, the discovery of a record number of right whales in Cape Cod Bay is considered a significant finding. The presence of the whales indicates the health of the ecosystem, and their abundance suggests that they have found a reliable food source. This discovery provides hope for the conservation of the species and underscores the importance of efforts to protect the whales from vessel collisions.
