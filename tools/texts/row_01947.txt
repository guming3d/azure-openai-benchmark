article: Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Did Real Madrid, FC Barcelona and five other Spanish football clubs get unfair advantage over their rivals through various government support measures potentially worth millions of dollars? That's what the European Commission wants to know, and it announced in Brussels, Belgium, on Wednesday an "in-depth investigation into public funding of certain" clubs. "Professional football clubs should finance their running costs and investments with sound financial management rather than at the expense of the taxpayer," European Commission Vice President Joaquin Almunia said in a prepared statement. "Member States and public authorities must comply with EU rules on state aid in this sector as in all economic sectors," said Almunia, a Spaniard who is reportedly an avid fan of Spanish football. The seven clubs under investigation are Real Madrid, FC Barcelona, Athletic de Bilbao, Osasuna (of Pamplona), Valencia, Hercules (of Alicante) and Elche. Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo said Monday that all the operations analyzed were in accord with Spanish law and that he expects the investigation to end once European officials get more information. Garcia-Margallo on Monday made public the inquiry, two days before Brussels officially announced it. Spanish media reported that the seven clubs either professed innocence or had no immediate comment. The EC will first investigate "possible tax privileges for Real Madrid, FC Barcelona, Athletic de Bilbao and Osasuna," Almunia's statement said. These four clubs are not private companies but instead have key decisions, such as the election of club president, done by their thousands of season-ticket holders. They were "exempted from the general obligation for professional football clubs to convert into sport limited companies" and currently have a lower tax rate than other clubs, the statement said. In a separate inquiry, the EC "will assess whether a widely reported land transfer between the City of Madrid and the club Real Madrid involved any state aid in favor of the club," the statement said. The land swap involved Real Madrid's old training grounds, near its home Bernabeu stadium, which became the site of four office and hotel skyscrapers, while the training ground was moved farther from downtown, near the airport. "This swap was based on a re-evaluation of a plot of land at a value of 22.7 million euros, instead of its earlier supposed value, in 1998, of 595,000 euros," the EC statement said. The investigation will also look into state-backed loans of about 110 million euros to three clubs operating in the Valencia region -- Valencia, Hercules and Elche, the statement said. It will look into whether the alleged activities provided "advantages to specific clubs that carry out economic activities in the EU internal market," the statement said.

chatgpt: The European Commission (EC) has announced it will carry out an in-depth investigation into public funding received by certain clubs in Spain. The move comes as a result of concerns that such government support may have given these clubs an unfair advantage over their rivals. In a statement, the EC said it would be looking closely at the possible tax privileges, land transfers, and state-backed loans received by these clubs. While the EC did not mention any specific clubs in its statement, it is widely believed that some of Spain's top football teams, including Barcelona and Real Madrid, are among those being investigated. The Spanish government, for its part, has insisted that all the operations analyzed comply with Spanish law. Speaking to reporters, Spain's Foreign Minister said that the government was "confident" that the investigation would find no evidence of wrongdoing. But critics of the clubs in question have argued that the investigation is long overdue. They believe that state aid has given these clubs a significant advantage over their rivals, allowing them to buy top players and dominate both the domestic and European football scenes. In particular, there have been questions raised about the way in which these clubs have been able to transfer land and other assets at beneficial rates, often at the expense of local taxpayers. Some observers have also suggested that the investigation could have wider implications for football in Europe as a whole. They argue that if the EC cracks down on state aid for clubs in Spain, it could prompt similar action against clubs in other countries, including Italy, France, and Greece. For now, the investigation is in its early stages, and it remains to be seen what, if anything, will come of it. But the fact that the EC has launched an in-depth inquiry into the public funding of certain clubs is a clear indication of the concerns that have been raised about the fairness of competition in Spanish football. In response to the EC's announcement, several of the clubs under scrutiny have released statements expressing their confidence that they have done nothing wrong. They have also pledged to cooperate fully with the investigation, in order to ensure that their operations are fully transparent and in compliance with all relevant regulations. It is unclear how long the investigation will take, but the EC has promised to release its findings as soon as possible. In the meantime, football fans will be watching closely to see what impact, if any, the inquiry has on the future of the sport in Spain and beyond.
