article: Nottingham Forest have won a £250,000 transfer fund to spend in the January window, despite being subject to a Football League embargo. Forest supporter Shaun Lander earned his side the prize as Sky Bet's Transfer Fund competition came to an end on Tuesday lunchtime, just over 24 hours after the Football League put Forest, along with Championship rivals Blackburn and Leeds, under an embargo for breaching financial fair play rules. But the League's chief executive Shaun Harvey confirmed that Stuart Pearce's men will still receive the windfall, however it can only be spent on the wages of players signing on a free transfer or on loan. Nottingham Forest have £250,000 to spend in January after receiving an unexpected windfall . But boss Stuart Pearce can only spend it on wages . 'They can use the money in terms of paying loan wages but not transfer fees,' he told Sky Sports News. A shortlist of 10 fans was selected at random from 70,000 customers of the Football League's title sponsors and Lander was announced as the lucky winner in the draw at Wembley - securing his club the bumper prize as well as a £5,000 cheque for himself. The clubs that missed out at the final hurdle were Huddersfield, Fulham, Cardiff, Leeds, Watford, Wigan, Southend and Exeter. Blackburn, Leeds and Forest were given a transfer ban for the January window after breaching the Football League's FFP rules. The League announced that the three clubs all incurred financial losses more than the £8million permitted during last season. Submissions from QPR, Leicester and Burnley - who were all promoted to the Premier League - plus the three clubs relegated last season will now be considered by the Football League. Under the transfer embargoes, the three clubs will be prohibited from signing any new players - either on a permanent or loan deal - unless they have 24 or fewer 'established players', which is described as 24 players aged 21 or over that have made at least five starts for the club.

chatgpt: A Nottingham Forest fan has won his club £250,000 in transfer funds as the prize for winning Sky Bet's Transfer Fund competition. The win comes as a much-needed boost for the club, who were given a transfer embargo by the Football League earlier this season. Despite the transfer embargo, the club can now spend the funds on player wages. This means that Forest will still be able to bring in new players and boost their chances of success on the pitch. The club has been struggling in recent years, and this injection of cash could be just what they need to turn things around. The lucky Forest fan who won the prize, whose name has not been released, is said to be over the moon. He entered the competition by placing bets on Sky Bet, and was randomly selected to win the prize. He said he was thrilled to be able to help his team and provide them with the funds they need to strengthen their squad. The Transfer Fund competition is just one of many ways that Sky Bet supports football clubs and their fans. The competition is open to all fans of Football League clubs, and encourages them to bet on the league matches. Each bet placed gives the fan a chance to win the prize, and also earns the club a share of the revenue. The CEO of Sky Bet, Richard Flint, spoke about the importance of supporting football clubs and their fans. "We know how much it means to fans to see their club succeed, and we're delighted to be able to offer these kinds of prizes to help them achieve that," he said. "We wish Nottingham Forest all the best in the rest of the season, and hope that this prize helps them achieve their goals." Nottingham Forest fans around the world are celebrating the win, and are eagerly anticipating seeing the new players that the club will bring in with the prize money. With the transfer embargo still in place, they will have to be careful with their spending, but the funds should be enough to make a real difference to their squad. The transfer window may be closed for now, but Forest will no doubt be keeping a close eye on potential targets for the next transfer window. With the help of the prize money, they could be back to their best in no time.
