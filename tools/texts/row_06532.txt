Its social networking features allow viewers to communicate with each other and the featured gamer during broadcasts. 'Broadcasting and watching gameplay is a global phenomenon and Twitch has built a platform that brings together tens of millions of people who watch billions of minutes of games each month,' said Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in a statement. The deal is the latest example of Amazon expanding into new commercial arenas. It introduced its own smartphone, the Fire, this month. Earlier this summer, it added same-day delivery, a set-top video streaming device to its list of services for members of Prime, its $99 annual loyalty program. The firm already has an in-house gaming studio that makes games, and its Fire TV set top box was designed to attract gamers. Google was earlier in talks to buy Twitch, with reports emerging in May that the internet search giant had agreed to buy the company for $1 billion, but a deal was never confirmed. 'Today, I'm pleased to announce we've been acquired by Amazon,' said CEO Emmet Shear, announcing the deal on the company's blog. 'We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term vision, and they want to help us get there faster. 'We're keeping most everything the same: our office, our employees, our brand, and most importantly our independence. 'But with Amazon's support we'll have the resources to bring you an even better Twitch.' It had been thought Google was the front runner. Video games are among the most popular content on YouTube, the world's No. 1 video website owned by Google. The site allows dedicated game fans to watch each other play online . However, Tech blog The Information first reported news of talks related to the Amazon deal early on Monday. The firm was first set up by Shear three years ago. 'It's almost unbelievable that slightly more than 3 years ago, Twitch didn't exist,' he wrote. 'The moment we launched, we knew we had stumbled across something special. 'But what followed surprised us as much as anyone else, and the impact it's had on both the community and us has been truly profound.'

So what exactly is Twitch and what makes it so valuable? With over 50 million monthly viewers and over 2 million unique streamers a month, Twitch has become a hugely popular hub for gamers to share their experiences and connect with others. Many top gamers and gaming companies now use the site as a key platform to connect with their audiences. The site originally launched in 2011 as a subsidiary of Justin.tv, but quickly gained momentum and branched off as its own platform in 2014. In just a few short years, Twitch has become one of the most popular and influential gaming sites on the web. While the site originally focused on video game streaming, it has since expanded to cover a wide range of other content, including esports tournaments and creative streams. While Google's interest in Twitch is notable, it's just part of a larger trend in the streaming and gaming industry. Major players like Amazon and Microsoft have also made major acquisitions in recent years, signaling the growing importance of streaming platforms in the gaming world. There's no doubt that Twitch is a hot commodity, and will continue to be a key player in the gaming world for years to come. Some of the biggest names in gaming regularly use Twitch to live-stream their games and connect with fans. For example, popular streamer Tyler "Ninja" Blevins has amassed over 14 million followers on the platform, and regularly streams himself playing popular titles like Fortnite and Apex Legends. Other top names in the gaming world, like PewDiePie and Shroud, have also built massive followings through Twitch. But Twitch isn't just a platform for individual gamers. It's also become a hub for esports tournaments and competitions. Major gaming organizations like League of Legends and Overwatch League now hold regular competitions on the site, drawing in millions of viewers from around the world. In addition, Twitch has also become a key platform for game developers to reveal and promote new titles. While the potential Google acquisition has garnered a lot of attention, Twitch has also faced some recent challenges. The platform has had issues with abuse and toxicity, with some streamers facing harassment and bullying from viewers. Twitch has been working to combat these issues, including implementing stricter guidelines and offering more support for victims. Despite these challenges, Twitch remains one of the most popular and influential platforms in the gaming world. With its massive following and diverse range of content, Twitch is sure to remain a key player in the gaming industry for years to come. Whether or not Google's potential acquisition goes through, Twitch's future looks bright.
