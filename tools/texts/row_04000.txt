article: By . Lizzie Edmonds . Fashion designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana have each been sentenced to 18-month jail terms for tax evasion charges - despite the prosecution arguing for the pair to be acquitted. Italy's appeals court upheld a verdict issued last June against the pair on charges of using Luxembourg holding company Gado to avoid paying taxes on royalties of about 1billion euros (£820million). In court yesterday, the pair were each given suspended sentences of 18 months in jail  - reduced from 20 months because of statute of limitations applied to certain facts in the case. Italian fashion designers Stefano Gabbana and Domenico Dolce were given an 18month jail sentence yesterday for tax evasion on royalties of up to 1billion euros. The pair are set to appeal the decision . The designers - who have always denied any wrongdoing - said they would appeal the decision. Lawyer Massimo Dinoia said: 'I am speechless. We are all shocked. The judgement is inexplicable and we will appeal. 'The prosecutor himself asked for them to be cleared.' The Milan prosecutor had asked the court back in March to clear the pair, who - in a protest last year at being 'pilloried' - closed their Milan stores. The previous decision, by a lower court, handed the duo suspended jail sentences of 20 months each. A fine of up to 10 million euros was also imposed over avoidance of the payments in Italy, where corporate taxes are among the highest in Europe. The case stems from an investigation that began in 2008 when Italian tax authorities stepped up their fight against tax evasion as a global financial crisis began to bite. President of the second section of the appeal court Laura Cairati, center, reads the fashion designers's sentence in court yesterday . The pair, pictured with Kylie Minogue, were first charged with tax evasion last June - but the Italian appeals court upheld the decision yesterday. Their sentence was reduced from 20 to 18 months . Fashion companies have fallen under the scrutiny of Italy's tax authorities partly due to the fact the sector has performed well during the country's longest recession since World War Two. 'Luxury is one of the few sectors to have done well in recent years,' said a partner specialising in tax at Grant Thornton in Milan who declined to be named. 'It is easier to go and ask for money where there is money as opposed to going to a troubled sector.' The cases rarely come to court, however. Giorgio Armani paid 270 million euros to tax authorities in early April to settle a dispute over payments from the group's subsidiaries abroad. Prada Holding, which controls Prada, paid a reported 400-420 million euros to settle taxes in Italy after completing a process of voluntary disclosure in December.

chatgpt: Italian fashion designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana, the founders of the luxury fashion brand Dolce & Gabbana, have been found guilty of tax evasion by an Italian court. The verdict comes after a long legal battle that started in 2013 when they were first accused of dodging taxes.  Last June, the designers were charged and sentenced to 20 months in jail for failing to declare about €1bn ($1.3bn) in income. The appeal court upheld the verdict, but reduced the sentence to 18 months, stating that the original sentence was "excessively high". However, the prosecution had asked the court to clear the pair back in March since they had paid over €400m ($450m) to settle the case.  The designers have always denied any wrongdoing and are set to appeal the verdict. Dolce and Gabbana were not present in court for the ruling. However, they made statements on social media in which they maintained their innocence and accused the Italian judicial system of being "outrageous". The designers have been under investigation since 2008, when Italian authorities accused them of evading taxes by selling their brands to a Luxembourg-based company. The company was allegedly created to avoid higher taxes in Italy. The case went to trial in 2013, and Dolce and Gabbana were originally acquitted of the charges against them. However, the Italian Supreme Court overturned the acquittal in 2014, paving the way for the retrial and the subsequent conviction. The case has garnered international attention and has been a high-profile example of authorities cracking down on tax evasion in the fashion industry. It has also highlighted the issue of tax planning by multinational corporations, which is becoming a growing concern for international governments. The designers are not the first in the fashion industry to face legal action over tax issues. In 2019, luxury fashion brand Chanel settled a tax evasion dispute with the French government, agreeing to pay around €1bn ($1.2bn) in back taxes.  The Dolce & Gabbana case has also raised questions about the impact that the conviction will have on the fashion brand's reputation. The company has been known for its glamorous Italian style and celebrity fan base, but the conviction of the founders could potentially harm the brand's image and sales. In the wake of the verdict, Dolce & Gabbana released a statement indicating that the company was "disappointed" but would continue to operate as usual. The statement also emphasized the fact that the case concerns only the two founders and not the fashion brand itself. The future of the case remains unclear, as the designers are set to appeal the verdict once again. However, the Dolce & Gabbana tax evasion trial serves as a reminder that even the biggest names in the fashion industry are not immune to legal action when it comes to tax avoidance issues.
