article: (CNN) -- The European Union will launch its first naval operation Tuesday, protecting vessels from pirate attacks off the coast of Somalia, EU policy chief Javier Solana announced Monday.

Solana said the operation is "very important" because EU vessels will be operating "in a place in the world that everybody's looking at because of the new problems related to piracy." "It's very important that we have taken that decision to launch it tomorrow," he added. The EU naval force will take over the role of escorting United Nations World Food Program vessels carrying food and relief supplies to war-torn Somalia, an EU news release said. Its mandate, which is spelled out in several U.N. Security Council resolutions, also will include "the protection of vulnerable vessels cruising off the Somali coast, and the deterrence, prevention and repression of acts of piracy and armed robbery off the Somali coast," the news release stated. The deployment follows a decision by the European Council in September that established a coordination cell that supported surveillance and protection operations by several member states off the Somali coast. Piracy has become increasingly common in that area this year, particularly in the Gulf of Aden. So far, pirates have attacked almost 100 vessels off Somalia's coast and successfully hijacked nearly 40, according to the International Maritime Bureau. Those hijacked vessels include an enormous oil tanker, a chemical tanker, and a ship laden with Soviet-era arms, including tanks. The pirates normally hold the ships for ransom. The Somali-based pirates have extended their reach beyond Somalia's coastline. On Saturday, a Dutch-operated container ship outran pirates off the coast of Tanzania, an IMB official told CNN. A luxury cruise ship carrying more than 1,000 passengers and crew successfully outran pirates off the coast of Yemen last weekend. A multinational fleet -- including vessels from the United States, NATO member states, Russia and India -- has been patrolling the Indian Ocean waters near the Gulf of Aden, which connects the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea. Around 20,000 oil tankers, freighters and merchant vessels pass along the crucial shipping route each year. In a recent interview provided to CNN, a pirate leader claimed attacks on shipping would continue so long as life in Somalia remained desperate. "The pirates are living between life and death," said the pirate leader, identified by only one name, Boyah. "Who can stop them? Americans and British all put together cannot do anything."

chatgpt: European Union (EU) naval force will be taking over the important role of escorting United Nations (UN) World Food Program (WFP) vessels, including the protection of vulnerable vessels that are cruising off the Somali coast. Pirates have been consistently attacking almost 100 vessels this year alone, making it a vital role for the EU force to take over. Other international countries such as the United States, India, Russia, and Malaysia contribute to patrolling the region. The job of the EU naval force is to escort vessels carrying much-needed supplies to vulnerable areas, mainly in the horn of Africa. The WFP plays a significant role in delivering lifesaving assistance in regions experiencing conflicts, natural disasters, or food shortages. The naval force's responsibility is to protect the vessels from pirates who have been operating in the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden. Vessels carrying food, supplies and aid for vulnerable people have long been a target for pirates seeking ransom, particularly off the coast of Somalia. The problem has been a concern for years, and the UN has been calling for more support from the international community to monitor the area and protect the vessels. The EU force will be taking over the role that NATO naval forces had previously played. The EU force has already been patrolling off the Somali coast, and their role in escorting WFP vessels will be an essential addition. A spokesperson for the EU naval force has stated that "it is a significant task, and we will do everything we can to protect the vessels under our escort." The EU naval force is stepping up patrols to ensure that they can protect the ships. Other countries, including the United States, India, Russia, and Malaysia, have been patrolling the area for years, but it is hoped that the EU force's addition will provide an increased level of protection. The international community recognises the importance of combating piracy, and this partnership is pivotal in ensuring that the vessels can deliver aid smoothly and safely. Piracy in the region severely impacts humanitarian efforts, and the EU force's involvement is critical to maintaining and increasing the delivery of aid to vulnerable people. The EU involvement is a welcomed sign for those who rely on the World Food Program for their basic necessities. It is not yet clear how long the EU force will be taking over the escorting role, but it is believed to be a long-term arrangement until a permanent solution can be found. Meanwhile, the EU naval force will continue to work closely with the WFP, fellow international partners, and ships' crews to ensure that the vessels under their protection can continue to deliver lifesaving assistance to those who need it the most. In conclusion, the EU naval force's involvement in escorting UN WFP vessels will be critical in ensuring that vulnerable people in conflict-affected areas have access to lifesaving aid. The piracy issue in the region has been a concern for years, and the contribution of the EU force, along with other international partners, will significantly impact the delivery of aid. The EU force's involvement is a positive development, and it is hoped that this will lead to a permanent solution to the piracy problem.
