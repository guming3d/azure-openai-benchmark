article: There have been plenty of spectacular catches in Twenty20 cricket but Trent Boult's effort for New Zealand against West Indies tops the lot. Boult was standing on the boundary when West Indies' Kieron Pollard mowed Corey Anderson into the leg-side. The ball was going over his head so the New Zealand fielder caught it with one hand (which was remarkable in itself) and threw the ball up into the air to avoid carrying it over the boundary for six.

All in a day's work: Boult looks nonchalant after taking the superb boundary catch . The best was yet to come however, as Boult sprung back into action, and dived forward and to his left to take the stunning catch. They say catches win matches, but this one didn't as New Zealand slumped to 126 all out chasing 165 in the second Twenty20 match. Boult's effort is possibly even better than the catches taken by the Aaron Finch/Adam Lyth combination for Yorkshire this summer. They teamed up to great effect against Lancashire in the Roses match, with Lyth taking the ball on the boundary and throwing it to Finch as he headed over the rope. And the roles were reversed last week against Leicestershire, when it was Finch who did the initial work and Lyth took the catch. That one was even better. But are either better than Boult's stunner?
