article: Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korean and South Korean military units exchanged gunfire near their border Friday, South Korean authorities said. No casualties were reported. The exchange happened after North Korean forces fired two rounds from a 14.5 millimeter machine gun at a South Korean military guard post near the border town of Chorwon, South Korea, about 73 miles (118 km) northeast of Seoul, according to an official at the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The South Korean unit responded with three "warning shots" from a .50-caliber machine gun and warned the North Korean guard post by loudspeaker to desist, the official said. The demilitarized zone at the location of the shooting is 1.3 kilometers (0.8 miles) wide. Chorwon was the scene of heavy fighting during the 1950-53 Korean War. North Korea on Friday threatened to retaliate against its neighbor for shunning bilateral military talks. The gunfire exchange apparently won't cancel reunions of families separated by the Korean War, which ended in a truce but no formal peace treaty. The weeklong reunions begin Saturday at Mount Kumgang, the two countries' joint mountain resort in the North. North Korea has requested record shipments of rice and fertilizer in exchange for concessions on the reunions, the South Korean Yonhap news agency reported earlier this week. While there are occasional shooting incidents across the demilitarized zones, the tensest flash point on the peninsula in recent years has been the disputed maritime border in the Yellow Sea. There were fatal naval clashes there in 1999 and 2002. In March this year, the sinking of a South Korean vessel killed 26 in what a South Korean and international investigation team concluded was a North Korean torpedo attack. North Korea continues to deny involvement. The prickly relationship between the countries since the Korean War has had periodic conciliatory moves and flare-ups. Friday's incident occurred two weeks before the G-20 summit in Seoul. The G-20 includes industrialized nations and developing economies, which focus on economic issues and economic policy coordination. Authorities said a total of 50,000 police and riot police will be deployed during the summit on November 11 and 12, according to Yonhap. Journalist  Andrew Salmon contributed to this report.

chatgpt: On Sunday, an incident was reported at the border of North Korea and South Korea. The incident reportedly occurred at a guard post in the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two countries. The DMZ is a strip of land that is about 160 miles long and 2.5 miles wide, and it serves as a buffer zone between the two countries. The incident occurred on the southern side of the DMZ, near the town of Cheorwon. According to South Korea's military, shots were fired by North Korean soldiers across the border towards a guard post. In response, South Korean troops returned fire and conducted a search of the area. The DMZ is one of the most heavily fortified places in the world, with barbed wire fences, landmines, and guard posts on both sides. Despite this, incidents like this do occur from time to time, as tensions between the two countries remain high. The DMZ was established in 1953, following the Armistice Agreement that ended the Korean War. It is supposed to be a demilitarized zone where military activity is not allowed. However, both North and South Korea have maintained a heavy military presence in the area. The incident comes at a time when North Korea has been increasing its military activity. In recent weeks, the country has launched several missiles into the Sea of Japan, and there have been reports of a possible nuclear test in the works. South Korea's military has said that they are keeping a close watch on the situation and have raised their level of readiness in response to the incident. South Korean and US troops are also conducting joint military exercises in the area, which is likely to increase tensions even further. The incident is a reminder of the fragile state of the relationship between North and South Korea. Despite efforts to improve relations over the years, the two countries remain technically at war, and tensions can flare up at any moment. The DMZ is a constant reminder of this, and incidents like this serve as a stark reminder of the danger that lurks in the area.
