article: (CNN) -- Malaysia says it will send back to New Zealand an envoy who used diplomatic immunity to flee a sex charge there, defusing a messy wrangle between the nations. Malaysia's government released a statement Wednesday saying it would return Second Warrant Officer Muhammad Rizalman Ismail to New Zealand "to cooperate fully and assist" authorities in their investigation into allegations against him . Ismail, 38, faces charges of burglary and assault with intent to commit rape, relating to an alleged attack in Wellington on May 9, according to officials in both countries. Superintendent Sam Hoyle, commander of Wellington police district where the alleged offenses took place, said in a statement that Ismail would be arrested at the New Zealand border and taken to the nearest court on his return. No date had yet been set for Ismail's return, he said. New Zealand Foreign Minister Murray McCully welcomed the news of Ismail's impending return, saying in a statement that it underlined the "good faith and integrity" with which Malaysia had approached the case. Ismail was working as a defense staff assistant at Malaysia's High Commission in Wellington when he allegedly stalked a 21-year-old woman and attacked her in her home. He was apprehended by police and appeared in court the next day, but returned to Malaysia with his family on May 22, Malaysia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. The case caused an outcry when it was reported in the New Zealand media, with Prime Minister John Key telling reporters it was his country's "very strong preference" that the man face justice there, rather than in Malaysia. But it later emerged that while at a formal level New Zealand had pressed Malaysia to waive Ismail's diplomatic immunity, Malaysian officials were under the impression after informal discussions that the New Zealand government was comfortable with him returning home to face justice, CNN affiliate TVNZ reported. McCully apologized Wednesday for his ministry's handling of the case, TVNZ reported. "It is now clear to me that officials engaged in informal communications over what is a complex case, in a manner that would have been ambiguous to the Malaysian government," he said in a statement. "I can say that the Malaysian side have acted entirely in good faith." Under the 1961 Vienna Convention, diplomats are granted full immunity from local laws while embassy staff are immune from criminal charges but not from specific civil matters. Malaysia's Ministry of Foreign affairs said in its statement that it had "complete faith in the New Zealand legal system" and "full confidence" Ismail would be dealt with fairly.

chatgpt: Malaysia's move to return a diplomat back to New Zealand to face a sexual assault charge has been welcomed by New Zealand Prime Minister, John Key. The 38-year-old diplomat, who fled New Zealand using diplomatic immunity, had caused considerable outrage in the country. Reports suggest that the diplomat was facing charges of assault with attempt to commit rape and burglary. The charges related to an incident that took place in Wellington last month. However, the Malaysian High Commission in New Zealand claimed diplomatic immunity for the official, who was later allowed to leave the country. This sparked outrage from the New Zealand public, who believed this was a clear case of abuse of diplomatic immunity. Prime Minister Key was quick to condemn the official's actions and demanded that the country who had granted the immunity should waive it. Mr Key argued that everyone in New Zealand is equal under the law, and that the diplomat should be held accountable for his alleged crimes. Despite the outcry, the Malaysian government stood by their decision and refused to waive the official's diplomatic immunity. However, it appears that this stance has now changed. On Wednesday, the Malaysian Foreign Ministry announced that they would be returning the diplomat back to New Zealand to face the charges against him. While itâ€™s unclear why Malaysia has now decided to cooperate with New Zealand authorities, the move has been welcomed by Prime Minister Key. He stated that the decision showed a willingness to work together and that justice would now be served. "I welcome their decision to return the diplomat so that he can face the charges against him in New Zealand. This is an example of two countries working together to uphold justice and the law," said Mr Key. The decision has also been warmly received by the New Zealand public. Many have taken to social media to express their relief and gratitude that justice will now be served. However, while the decision to return the diplomat is a welcome move, questions remain over the use of diplomatic immunity to evade justice. Many are calling for a review of the system to ensure it cannot be abused in the future. In conclusion, the decision by Malaysia to return a diplomatic official who fled a sexual assault charge has been received positively by New Zealand authorities. However, the case has highlighted the need for a review of the diplomatic immunity system to prevent its abuse in the future.
