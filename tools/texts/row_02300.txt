article: (CNN) -- The Washington Monument will remain closed for repairs for at least another year and possibly into 2014, National Park Service officials said Monday. The 555-foot-tall monument has been closed since an earthquake struck the mid-Atlantic region near Richmond, Virginia, in August 2011. Repairs are expected to begin this fall. The service said that huge scaffolding will be needed for the outside repair work, which will take 12 to 18 months to complete. Some of the repair work will include sealing cracks, removing loose pieces of stone and repairing joints. "The challenge is most of those cracks are at the very top portion of the monument and the ability to get workers up there to successfully repair it requires a major scaffolding effort," said Bob Vogel, superintendent of the National Mall and Memorial Parks. "The monument is in good shape. It's going to be here for years to come, but in order to safely allow visitors to get up to the top, we need to make those repairs." Where to find exceptional America . At least nine of the marble panels on the exterior near the top are cracked, according to a post-earthquake assessment. Others are chipped but not in danger of falling, the report said. About 700,000 visitors go to the top of the monument in a typical year, Vogel said. "It's very disappointing," he said. "I hear from people everyday asking how they can get into it." Isaac Boria came from Port St. Lucie, Florida, with his wife and two children. Seeing the view from the top of the monument was high on their to-do list. "That's Mother Nature, " he said. "Mother Nature did its thing, and I'd rather be safe than sorry." Indoor repairs are also required. Some interior tie beams as well as some cracked panels will be fixed. A pedestrian walkway will be redirected to make room for a temporary road for construction vehicles. The 5.8-magnitude earthquake may have also caused the structure to sink a little. In September, the monument was declared structurally sound by engineers. David Rubenstein, co-founder of the investment firm The Carlyle Group, has donated $7.5 million toward the repair project. With Rubenstein's donation and congressional funds that were approved in December, Deputy Interior Secretary David Hayes said in January there was enough money to begin the repairs. The Washington Monument was built between 1848 and 1884 and has been repaired three times previously, the most recent work done from 1997 to 2000. CNN's Eric Fiegel and Lindy Royce contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Washington D.C. - The Washington Monument is set to undergo repairs after sustaining significant damage from a 5.8-magnitude earthquake that occurred in August. The National Park Service has confirmed that the repairs will take between 12 to 18 months to complete. Crews are set to begin work this fall, according to a top official. Speaking to reporters, the official explained that the repairs will be complicated due to the high level of damage the monument sustained during the earthquake. The 555-foot-tall structure has been a witness to the country's history and is an iconic sight in Washington, D.C. It has withstood natural disasters and severe weather conditions in the past. However, the 2011 earthquake caused significant damage to the marble and stone structure that now needs fixing. The National Park Service has been working hard to ensure the repair work meets the monument's engineering standards and preserves its historic character. The service's priority is to ensure that the monument remains accessible to the public throughout the repair period. The monument's current closure is due to the COVID-19 pandemic and unrelated to the repair work. The Washington Monument's rehabilitation project consists of two phases. The first phase comprises of necessary repairs while the second phase involves constructing a new security screening facility. The aim is to enhance security measures and improve the visitors' experience. The monument uprising began in 1848, and it was dedicated to the first President of the United States, George Washington, in 1885. The structure sits on a 36-square-foot foundation, and visitors can climb to the top of the obelisk for a 360-degree view of the area. The repair work is a cooperative effort between the National Park Service and The Trust for the National Mall. Together, they aim to raise $10 million towards the repair of the monument. The trust's president, Susan Spain, believes the monument's history and significance in American history will play a critical role in the fundraising efforts. In conclusion, the Washington Monument's earthquake damage will require extensive repair work that will take a considerable amount of time. Despite the complexity of the repairs, the National Park Service, and The Trust for the National Mall aim to work together to preserve the monument's historical significance and ensure it remains accessible to the public.
