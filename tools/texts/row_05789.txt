article: (CNN) -- The Syrian vice president arrived Friday in Moscow to talk with Russia's foreign minister about the unrest that has roiled Syria for months, a Russian state news agency reported. Vice President Farouk al-Sharaa was to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov "to discuss ways for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in his country," the Itar-Tass news agency reported. His visit came on the same day that at least 23 people, including four children, were killed across Syria, according to the Local Coordinating Committees, a network of opposition activists that organizes and documents demonstrations. The dead also included four women, the group said. Ten died in Homs, four in Daraa, five in Hama, two in the Damascus suburbs and one each in Idleb and Deir Ezzour, it said. But the official Syrian Arab News Agency said its correspondents had quoted official sources as saying that no casualties had occurred during the day, "although armed terrorist groups attacked law-enforcement members in some areas."

Russia has also opposed calls for foreign intervention in Syria and has urged that country to accept international monitors. The United Nations says 5,000 people have been killed in months of unrest in Syria, where pro-democracy activists are calling for an end to the rule of President Bashar al-Assad. The Syrian government's repression of unrest has triggered criticism from Western nations as well as from the Arab League, which expelled Syria last month and has been pushing to send monitors into Syria. At the United Nations, Russia introduced a draft resolution this week that, it says, "considerably strengthens" previous drafts "with regard to the interest in violence, with regard to the need to uphold human rights, with regard to expediting reforms." The resolution "strongly condemns" violence "coming from all parties, including disproportionate use of force by Syrian authorities." It also would "give a strong message to the Arab League that we encourage them to continue their efforts, and working together with the government of Syria, and to carry out its plans to deploy the monitoring mission in Syria," Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said Thursday at the United Nations. The draft does not include sanctions or an arms embargo. Germany's U.N. ambassador, Peter Wittig, described the Russian draft resolution as "insufficient" but said it could be improved.

chatgpt: In the latest developments from Syria, activists report that at least 23 people were killed on Friday. The deaths occurred in the midst of escalating violence in the country, where an ongoing civil war has claimed countless lives over the years. According to the activists' reports, the deaths occurred in various incidents across the country. No further details have been provided at this time. However, state-run Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) has disputed the reports of any casualties. The agency reports that there were no incidents that resulted in any deaths or injuries. Meanwhile, Syria's Vice President has travelled to Moscow to attend talks with Russian officials. The purpose of the talks is not known, but it is assumed that the ongoing situation in Syria will be the main topic of discussion. Russia has been a key ally of Syria's government throughout the civil war, and has consistently opposed any moves towards sanctions or other punitive measures against the regime. Recently, the Russian government proposed a new United Nations resolution on Syria, which it hopes will help to bring about a resolution to the conflict. The proposed resolution includes provisions for increased humanitarian aid and a call for all parties involved in the conflict to respect international law. It is not yet clear whether this resolution will be accepted by the United Nations, or what impact it may have on the situation in Syria. Despite repeated calls from the international community for an end to the violence, the civil war in Syria shows no signs of abating. The death toll continues to climb, and millions of Syrians have been forced to flee their homes and seek refuge elsewhere. The Syrian government and rebel groups alike have been accused of committing atrocities against civilians, including the use of chemical weapons. The conflict has also drawn in outside powers, including Russia and the United States, who have both carried out airstrikes against targets in Syria. As the situation in Syria continues to escalate, many are left wondering what the future holds for the country and its people. It remains to be seen whether any progress can be made towards a peaceful resolution to the conflict, or if the violence and suffering will continue indefinitely.
