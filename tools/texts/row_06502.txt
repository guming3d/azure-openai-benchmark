Scroll down for video . British metal band, The Defiled, played the world's first-ever gig on a floating iceberg . And between the freezing temperatures and fast flowing ice, the rock stars did just that. The small crowd, mostly from the nearby town of Kulusuk, ventured to the ice field to watch this once-in-a-lifetime gig from fishing boats. To reach their iceberg stage, the band first flew to Iceland, before transferring to Kulusuk, Greenland, and then heading by boat to the small island of Tasiilaq, which has a population of just over 2000. It actually took several days of searching to find the 'perfect' berg - one that was large and thick enough to hold the band and all of their equipment. It took days of searching to find the perfect iceberg - it needed to be large and thick enough to hold the band . Locals, who have lived and worked on the icebergs for years, helped the band to shuttle their instruments and sound equipment to the gig stage, and to thank them for their help, the group donated their equipment to the local community hall after the gig. Band member Stitch D said: 'This has to be one of the most insane gigs we've ever played! You see these things on TV documentaries but it's not until you get to see them in real life that you realise just how big and amazing icebergs are. 'Although it was cold, I don't think any of us noticed once we got started. The stage location literally takes your breath away.' To capture the footage, state-of-the-art flying drone cameras were used and controlled by nearby boats . Known for their dark and imposing on-stage outfits - which provided an incredible contrast to the all-white surroundings - The Defiled played a 30 minute set in total, featuring tracks from their latest album Daggers. To capture the footage, Jägermeister and the band utilised state-of-the-art 'octocopter flying drone cameras,' controlled remotely by the boats nearby, which hovered above the iceberg. Tom Carson, Jägermeister music manager, added: 'As far as stage backdrops go, I don’t think you’ll find anything more impressive than this.'

chatgpt: English rock band The Defiled made history by performing the world's first gig on top of a floating iceberg in Greenland. The group embarked on the unique journey as part of Jägermeister's Ice Cold Gig series, which aims to push the boundaries of music and explore new, challenging environments. The band had to face a number of challenges on their journey to reach the iceberg, including enduring freezing temperatures and navigating the treacherous ice. Once they arrived, they had to use specialist equipment, including thermal layers and crampons, to climb and set up the stage safely. Despite the treacherous conditions, The Defiled delivered an electrifying performance to a captivated audience, featuring a set list of some of their most popular tracks, including "As I Drown" and "Blood Sells". The icy surroundings certainly created a unique atmosphere for the crowd, who danced along to the thunderous beats and guitar riffs on top of an ice floe. After the gig, the band didn't waste any time basking in their achievement. Instead, they donated their instruments to the local community hall in the nearby town of Ilulissat. The donation will provide the hall with the equipment needed to host local bands and events, strengthening the community's cultural scene. Speaking about their experience, The Defiled said, "Playing on top of an iceberg was truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience. It was a surreal and magical moment for us all. We're honored to have had the chance to participate in such a unique event and thrilled to be a part of the Jägermeister Ice Cold Gig series." The band's performance on top of the iceberg was filmed and documented for a short film that will be released in the near future. The film will provide a chance for those who weren't able to attend the gig to experience the electrifying atmosphere and unique setting of the world's first gig on an iceberg. The Jägermeister Ice Cold Gig series has been creating opportunities for bands to perform in unique, challenging locations since 2012. Past events have included a gig in a snow cave in Austria and a show in a Canadian ice dome, proving that the series isn't afraid to push the boundaries of music and explore new, exciting environments. For The Defiled, their performance on the floating iceberg will surely be a moment they will never forget, and the donation of their instruments will have a lasting impact on the community of Ilulissat. It's a perfect example of the power of music and how it can bring people together, even in the most remote and unexpected locations.
