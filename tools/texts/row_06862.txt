chatgpt: Santa Barbara resident David Saldamando is one lucky angler after coming face-to-face with an 8-foot-long thresher shark during a recent fishing trip conducted with his friend, Scotty Westgaard. The adrenaline-pumping experience began when Saldamando netted the massive predator on his line. The 39-year-old fisherman then fought for nearly thirty minutes before successfully pulling the thresher shark onto his boat. However, what happened next left Saldamando shaken and in disbelief. Westgaard recorded a video of Saldamando standing in the water with his back to the shark. As the video progresses, the audience watches in terror as the thresher shark comes within inches of his feet. "It could have been a disastrous encounter," said Saldamando, who is a seasoned angler in the Santa Barbara area. "I've hooked thresher sharks before, but I've never had one come at me like that." In the video, Westgaard can be heard shouting, "Get out of the water, Dave!" as the shark swims dangerously close to his feet. As the thresher shark passes him, it thrashes its tail in a violent motion, sending a wave of water crashing over Saldamando's head. "I was scared, no doubt about it," Saldamando added. "I could feel the wind from its tail brush my toes, and I could see its teeth. It was an intense moment." Thresher sharks are known for their long tails that are often used to whip and stun prey. They can grow up to 20 feet long and weigh over 1,000 pounds. Despite their intimidating size, thresher sharks are not considered a significant threat to humans and are rarely involved in unprovoked attacks. Saldamando's encounter with this massive predator serves as a reminder to all anglers and beach-goers to remain vigilant and stay alert when in the water. While incidents like these are rare, it's crucial to stay educated on potential risks. Despite the close call, Saldamando was thrilled with the catch, a catch that he waited for years to get. The thresher shark was estimated to weigh around 100 pounds and would provide enough meat to feed his newlywed wife and family members. This encounter will stick with Saldamando forever and will surely make for a riveting story to pass down to future generations. Saldamando and Westgaard hope that their video helps to raise awareness and emphasize the importance of respecting marine wildlife.
