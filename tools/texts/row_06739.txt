College officials confirmed the number of students charged but declined to comment further until the appeals process ends later this month. The students under investigation are all  athletes who were being given special classes in ethics and religion. Prof Randall Balmer noticed he was receiving far more answers to his questions than students in the class . Dartmouth College suspended 64 students for cheating in an ethic class (suspended students not in picture) Professor Randall Balmer confirmed that most of the students had been suspended for a term. The alleged scandal involves hand-held electronic clickers which are used to answer questions during college classes. It is believed that some students may have passed their clickers onto their classmates who answered the questions on their behalf. According to The Boston Globe, the scandal was unearthed after Prof Balmer noticed that he was receiving significantly more answers to his questions by electronic clicker than the number of students sitting before him in the lecture theater. Prof Balmer described the situation of cheating in an ethics course was ironic and 'very sad and regrettable on many levels'. He said: 'A lot of the students will probably come away with a stain on their transcripts. And, a level of trust that is so necessary for students and teachers has been betrayed, and I feel sad about that.' Prof Balmer reported his concerns, which initially involved 43 of the 280 students in the class. A further 21 came forward after details of the investigation were made public. The college confirmed that honour code violations were considered 'major misconduct'. Prof Balmer added: 'I think honour no longer is something that has a lot of resonance in society, and I suppose in some ways it’s not surprising that students would want to trade the nebulous notion of honour with what they perceive as some sort of advantage in professional advancement.' According to college newspaper The Dartmouth, Prof Balmer has decided against failing those students found guilty of cheating and instead reduced their grades by one letter. More than seven in 10 of the students on the course are members of the various college athletics teams. Prof Balmer said: 'Part of the reason I designed this course was that I had the sense that some athletes coming here to Dartmouth might have felt just a little bit overwhelmed or intimidated academically. 'I wanted to design a course that would appeal to their interests and allow them to have an early success in the classroom, and I’d hoped that they would be able to build on that success throughout their time at Dartmouth.'

chatgpt: In an unfortunate incident, 64 students enrolled in an ethics and religion class have been accused of cheating. The cheating was discovered by the professor of the class, Randall Balmer, who noticed that the number of answers he received through electronic clickers was more than the number of students present in the class. The use of electronic clickers is a common tool used by professors to check the attendance and participation of students in the class. Each student has a unique clicker that he/she must use to answer questions in the class. In this case, it seems that some students gave their clickers to their colleagues, who then answered the questions on their behalf. Professor Balmer was quick to notice the discrepancy and reported the matter to the university authorities, who have now launched an investigation into the matter. The accused students are from different academic years and backgrounds, and it remains unclear as to how they were able to coordinate the cheating. Speaking to reporters, Professor Balmer expressed his disappointment at the cheating scandal. He said that he was saddened and regretted the incident on so many levels. According to him, the use of electronic clickers is an important tool that helps to keep students engaged and involved in the class. Cheating not only undermines the learning process but also goes against the values of ethics and religion that the class is supposed to instill in students. The university authorities have also expressed their concern about the incident. In a statement, the university said that they take cheating very seriously and will not tolerate any form of academic misconduct. They have assured students that the matter will be fully investigated and that appropriate action will be taken against the accused students. Cheating is a serious offense and can have long-term consequences for the students involved. It not only affects their academic performance but also undermines their integrity and reputation. The students who have been accused of cheating will have to face the consequences of their actions, which could include expulsion from the university. This incident also underscores the importance of academic integrity and the need for students to uphold it. Cheating not only harms the individual student but also affects the reputation of the university and the wider academic community. It is essential that students take their academic responsibilities seriously and avoid any form of misconduct. In conclusion, the cheating scandal involving 64 students in an ethics and religion class is a sad and regrettable incident. It has raised serious concerns about academic integrity and the need for students to uphold it. The university authorities have launched an investigation into the matter and are determined to take appropriate action against the accused students. It is a stark reminder to students that cheating is not only wrong but also has severe consequences.
