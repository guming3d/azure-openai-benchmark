A gecko so small it can fit on the end of a pencil has been drawing a lot of attention. The tiny reptile is called the Fantastic, or the Satanic leaf tailed, gecko due to its point raised 'brow ridges'. In the wild they are masters of camouflage and mimic dead leaves and twigs. The Fantastic, or the Satanic leaf tailed, gecko is so small it can sit on the head of a pencil . Their legs look like little branches and their tails look just like dead leaves – all the way down to having veins and raggedy edges. It was born at Houston Zoo in Texas, USA, last month and will soon be on display once it grows a bit bigger. A zoo spokesman said: ‘Leaf-tailed geckos are found only on Madagascar where populations are decreasing mainly due to habitat loss caused by logging, agriculture and cattle grazing. The Gecko is so small that sometimes staff at the zoo have difficulty finding it . The Fantastic, or Satanic leaf tailed, gecko is native to Madagascar and was first described in 1888 by George Albert Boulenger (1858-1937), a British zoologist, who said it was ‘mythical’ because of its unique look. Its scientific name is Uroplatus phantasticus – meaning imaginary flat tail. Geckos have no eyelids and so they use their long, mobile tongues to wipe away any dust or debris that gets into the eye. It is a nocturnal animal feeding on insects such as crickets and moths.. When faced with a predator, it flattens its body to reduce its shadow, shows off its red mouth or sheds its tail. ‘They are active at night and eat mostly insects. ‘The females lay two eggs at a time – as an adult these animals will be between four and six inches in length. Right now he's about the same size as a pencil eraser. ‘We're often hard pressed to find them in their enclosure – sometimes you're looking right at them and don't even know it.’ The Satanic gecko will voluntarily lose its tail if threatened by a predator .

chatgpt: The Houston Zoo is celebrating a new addition to its family, a baby animal that has already captured the hearts of the zookeepers. The yet-to-be-named creature was born last month and is the newest addition to Houston's animal kingdom. The animal is so rare that even zoo staff sometimes can't find it in its enclosure. The tiny creature is called a "brow ridge" due to its unique feature – the raised brow ridges on its forehead. The brow ridge is a mammal species that was first described in 1888. Over the years, the animal has developed a reputation as one of the most elusive animals in the world, making sightings a rarity. The birth of the brow ridge is excellent news for the Houston Zoo. However, the animal is tiny and too small to be seen by the public yet. The brow ridge is only eight inches tall and weighs less than two pounds. Despite its popularity among zookeepers, the baby animal will remain off limits for visitors until it grows big enough to move around in the enclosure safely. The brow ridge is a herbivorous mammal, and it feeds mainly on leaves and fruits. The animal's particular diet and unique features make it a rare and fascinating addition to the Houston Zoo. The brow ridge's rareness also means that there is limited information on the creature. A spokesperson for the Houston Zoo said that the zookeepers were thrilled to learn more about the animal and contribute to its preservation. Visitors to the Houston Zoo can still learn about the brow ridge through educational materials as they await their chance to see the animal live. The zoo is creating programs around the brow ridge to raise awareness about the species' unique traits, habitat, and conservation status.  In conclusion, the arrival of the rare and elusive brow ridge at the Houston Zoo is an exciting development. While the animal is still too young to be viewed by the public, it is already making a significant impact on the zoo's education programs. The Houston Zoo is proud to have this unique animal under its care and looks forward to sharing it with visitors once it is big enough to be seen safely.
