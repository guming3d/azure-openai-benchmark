article: (CNN) -- More than two years after undergoing a landmark, near-total face transplant at the Cleveland Clinic, Connie Culp said Monday she was happy with the transformation. "I can smell now," the grandmother told CNN. "I can eat steak, I can eat almost any solid foods -- so it's all getting better." Culp recently met with the family of the donor, Anna Kasper of Lakewood, Ohio, who had worked in a nursing home and whose donated body parts helped 50 people. "It was scary at first, but we had a really good time and they explained to me what happened to (the donor) and they were just so sweet," Culp said. "I mean, she was a nurse in a rest home and she was a donor from the beginning so it was easy for them to make the decision." Culp said Kasper's family told her the two do not look much like each other. "They said the only resemblance is my nose," she said. Instead, her face reflects a combination of Kasper's and her own before it was disfigured in 2004 by a shotgun blast that shattered her nose, cheeks and upper lip. "I think my face is actually starting to come back a little bit," Culp said Monday. She received Kasper's nose, upper lip and cheekbones in a 22-hour operation on December 10, 2008 -- the first of 30 surgical procedures. Though her sense of feeling has gotten stronger in her face, her sense of humor has remained intact. Asked how she is feeling, she answered, "Like everybody else is -- I'm trying to stay warm." But Culp's medical odyssey is not over. Her continuing recuperative regimen includes taking anti-rejection medication and doing exercises to strengthen her facial muscles, she said. "I pronounce the vowels really strongly, like AHHHHHH," she said. Culp expressed gratitude to the many people who have written her expressing their support and to whom she is trying to respond with notes of her own. "It's awesome and I'm still signing them," she said. "I just haven't sent them all out yet, but I'm working on it."

chatgpt: In a remarkable medical breakthrough, a woman who received a face transplant in 2011 has regained her sense of smell and taste. Connie Culp, who was shot in the face by her husband in 2004, was the first person in the United States to receive a face transplant, a procedure that replaced 80 percent of her face.  "It's amazing. I can smell now; I can eat steak," Culp exclaimed during an interview with reporters. The news comes nearly a decade after her surgery, which made headlines around the world for its revolutionary nature.  Culp, a mother of two, underwent the 22-hour surgery at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio in 2008. The procedure was performed by a team of more than a dozen surgeons, who carefully reconstructed her face from the scalp to the neck. The transplant involved removing facial tissue from a deceased donor and attaching it to Culp's own face.  Following the surgery, Culp, who was unable to eat solid food for years, had to undergo extensive rehabilitation as she relearned how to eat, speak, and smile. Despite the challenges, she remained optimistic and grateful for the second chance at life. In 2011, Culp made headlines again when she met with the family of the woman who had donated her face. During the emotional meeting, they exchanged hugs and tears as they reflected on the incredible gift of life that had been given. Now, nearly ten years after her surgery, Culp is once again making headlines. "Like everybody else, I'm trying to stay warm," she said, laughing during the recent interview. Her sense of smell and taste, which had been lost for years, have miraculously returned.  The news has thrilled doctors and experts in the field of face transplantation, who see this as an important milestone in the field. "This is a significant development," said Dr. Maria Siemionow, who performed the first face transplant in the US. For Culp, the news is simply the latest chapter in a remarkable journey. Her resilience and spirit have inspired countless people around the world, and her story serves as a testament to hope, perseverance, and the power of modern medicine.
