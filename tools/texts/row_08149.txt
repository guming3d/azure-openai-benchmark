Tourists visiting Britain's capital may soon be able to dawdle for longer without upsetting the city's notoriously short-tempered drivers. London is road testing 'intelligent' pedestrian crossings designed to read the requirements of the crossing throngs and offer a safer way to get from A to B. Busy drivers will welcome the 'call cancel' technology, which cancels the traffic stop action if a pedestrian wanders off after pressing the button, while video cameras and sensors will automatically detect how many people are waiting as well as the speed of the crossing pedestrians. Safety first: TfL is road testing intelligent crossings that read the requirements of the pedestrian traffic . The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, and Transport for London (TfL) hope that the new pedestrian SCOOT (Split Cycle Offset Optimisation Technique) system will eventually help make it easier and safer for millions people to cross the road throughout the capital. The first trials of SCOOT will . take place on crossings outside busy Balham and Tooting Bec Underground . stations this summer. They are part of an ongoing road safety system in the city, including the recent Pedestrian Countdown technology which was successfully rolled out in 200 locations. Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: . 'I am delighted that London is the first city in the world to be . trialling this cutting-edge equipment, which will benefit pedestrians . across the city. The hi-tech systems will be trialled at two of London's busiest tube stations this summer . 'This . really is a fantastic example of how London is leading the way by using . 21st century technology to help make it easier for people to get around . our great city. 'Innovation like this is key to keeping London moving efficiently and making our roads safer for everyone to use.' TfL's Leon Daniels said of the crossings of the future: 'These new trials of pedestrian detection technology will allow our traffic signals to become even more intelligent, bringing huge benefits to those waiting to cross the road where there is heavy pedestrian demand.' Depending on the outcome of the summer trials TfL hopes to develop the technology to use at other busy pedestrian areas such as sporting venues and busy high streets.

chatgpt: Trials for a new road safety system, known as SCOOT, are set to begin during the summer of 2014. This innovative system is designed to enhance the safety of both motorists and pedestrians on busy roads. With sensors and cameras strategically placed along busy intersections, the SCOOT system will monitor the level of pedestrian traffic, alerting drivers to the presence of people crossing the street. This state-of-the-art system is a response to the growing concern over road safety, particularly in busy urban areas. One of the key features of SCOOT is the 'call cancel' system, which will allow drivers to cancel a pedestrian request if they are running late for an appointment or have another pressing engagement. This is likely to be a welcome feature for busy drivers who may feel frustrated with the delay caused by pedestrian crossings. Interestingly, the first zebra crossing was created in 1949 in Slough, England. The concept quickly gained popularity and was introduced in other countries, including the US and Canada. However, as the volume of traffic on roads continued to grow exponentially, it became apparent that existing safety systems needed to be updated and enhanced in order to better protect pedestrians. With SCOOT, the hope is that both drivers and pedestrians will feel more secure on the roads. As the system is tested and refined over time, it is likely that it will become an essential component of road safety infrastructure. The combination of sensors and cameras will provide real-time data that can be used to pinpoint areas of concern and take steps to improve overall safety. One important aspect of the SCOOT system is its ability to adapt to changing road conditions. For example, if traffic is lighter during certain times of day, the system will adjust accordingly to ensure that pedestrian crossings are still safe. This kind of flexibility is one of the key advantages of a technology-driven safety system, as it can provide both real-time and long-term benefits. Overall, the SCOOT system represents a major step forward in road safety. By providing drivers with real-time information about pedestrian crossings and enabling them to make adjustments as needed, the hope is that accidents and injuries will be significantly reduced. As the trials get underway this summer, many people will be curious to see how the system performs in real-world conditions.
