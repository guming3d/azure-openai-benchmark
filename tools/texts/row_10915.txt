article: (CNN) -- Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Jovan Belcher likely had a devastating brain disease when he shot and killed his girlfriend and then himself two years ago, a doctor says in a new report. Dr. Piotr Kozlowski, who prepared the report, found tangles of tau proteins in seven sections of the hippocampus structure in the brain, findings consistent with other players diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE. The hippocampus is a seahorse-shaped structure crucial for memory. CNN had an outside neuropathologist validate the findings of Belcher's pathology report. The doctor said the results appear consistent with CTE, which is concerning because tau is not normally found in such a young brain. CTE is a progressive degenerative brain disease found in some athletes with a history of repetitive brain trauma. More than 50 former NFL players, including Junior Seau and Dave Duerson, have been posthumously diagnosed with the disease. Many have committed suicide. Belcher's body was exhumed in December, a year after he was buried. Former NFLer: 'Your mind just goes crazy' Belcher, who was 6-foot-2 and weighed 228 pounds, played for the Chiefs from 2009 to 2012, appearing in 59 games. On December 1, 2012, the linebacker fatally shot his girlfriend, Kassandra Perkins, in the same home with their 3-month-old daughter. He then drove to the team's practice facility, thanked his coaches, and shot himself. He was 25 years old. The brain tissue of people found to have CTE displays an abnormal build-up of tau -- a protein that, when it spills out of cells, can choke off, or disable, neural pathways controlling things like memory, judgment and fear. CTE can be diagnosed only after death. Report: Former NFL player's body exhumed for brain study . In July a federal judge approved a preliminary settlement in a class action concussion lawsuit filed by thousands of former NFL players against the National Football League. The suit alleges the NFL didn't do enough to warn players about the risks of brain damage. About 5,000 former players are involved in the class action but as many as 20,000 might be eligible. Current NFL players are not included in the agreement. Some family members can also file a claim after the ruling becomes final this fall. First soccer, rugby players diagnosed with CTE .

chatgpt: Scientists from the Department of Pathology at Boston University School of Medicine have made a breakthrough discovery in the case of NFL player Jovan Belcher, who killed his girlfriend and then himself in 2012. They found a protein in the 25-year-old’s brain that should not have been there. The discovery has led to speculation that Belcher suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).  CTE is a degenerative brain disease that is caused by repeated traumatic brain injuries, such as those received in American football. CTE can only be diagnosed after death, but it is becoming increasingly evident that it can cause a range of symptoms, including depression, anxiety, memory loss, and cognitive decline.  Dr. Ann McKee, chief of neuropathology at the Boston VA Healthcare System and director of the CTE Center at Boston University, led the study that examined Belcher’s brain. The study found that there was a high concentration of tau protein in the amygdala, which is a part of the brain that is responsible for the processing of emotions. The concentration of tau protein was significantly higher than what is seen in the brains of people who have not had repeated head injuries.  Speaking about the research, Dr. McKee stated that “the pathology was severe and widespread, and consistent with a diagnosis of CTE, as was the medical history provided by his family and girlfriend.” This indicates that the damage to Belcher’s brain was extensive and had long-term effects on his mental health.  The implications of this finding are significant. Belcher’s case is just one of many that have brought the dangers of American football to public attention. Recent studies have shown that the risk of developing CTE is higher among football players, causing concern among parents and players alike.  The NFL has taken action to address this issue in recent years, increasing penalties for helmet-to-helmet collisions and requiring players to undergo regular cognitive testing. Despite this, more research is needed to fully understand the risks and long-term consequences of playing football.  The findings of Dr. McKee’s study are a step in the right direction for understanding and addressing the problem of CTE. It is hoped that this research will help to prevent future tragedies like that of Jovan Belcher, and raise awareness about the dangers of repeated head injuries in sports.
