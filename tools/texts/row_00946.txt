article: By . George Mair . UPDATED: . 11:32 EST, 18 January 2012 . The haunting facial cast of mass murderer William Burke, taken shortly before his execution, is to go on display later this month. It will be shown alongside Burke’s skeleton at the University of Edinburgh’s Anatomy Museum as part of an exhibition of medical artefacts. Together with accomplice William Hare, Burke carried out at least 15 murders in the 1820s and sold the bodies for use in anatomy lessons. Exhibit A: Dr Gordon Findlater holds the death mask of mass murderer William Burke, soon to go on public display . Last look: The museum also boasts the death mask of Sir Isaac Newton, who discovered gravity, left, and Scottish writer Sir Walter Scott . When the pair were caught, Hare was offered immunity from prosecution if he confessed and agreed to testify against his former partner. Burke was sentenced to death by hanging in 1829, and then publicly dissected at the Edinburgh Medical College. The dissecting professor, Alexander Monro, dipped his quill pen into Burke's blood and wrote, 'This is written with the blood of Wm Burke, who was hanged at Edinburgh. This blood was taken from his head.' Edinburgh University's Museum of Anatomy has now undergone a major revamp, and will open to the public on January 28 – the 183rd  anniversary of Burke’s execution. More than 40 masks, created from casts taken in both life and death, will be on display. Historic faces on show will include Sir Walter Scott, Isaac Newton, Shakespeare and King George III. Such masks were popular in the 19th century, when they were used in  the now-discredited practice of phrenology. This postulated that the shape and size of a person’s skull could help explain their mind and behaviour. Other artefacts at the museum include 19th century anatomical teaching models made from wax and wood, as well as a preserved body from the late 1790s, which is exhibited alongside an etching carried out when the remains were embalmed.

Preserved in plaster: The cast came to light unexpectedly in 2009 after being found in a store cupboard at Inveraray jail in Argyll . Visitors to the museum at the Teviot Medical School, which opened in 1884, will also be able to see the  historic anatomy lecture theatre. Gordon Findlater of the university’s anatomy department said: ‘The museum provides a fascinating insight into how anatomy has progressed from the late 1700s to the present day.’ The Anatomy Museum, in Teviot Place, Edinburgh, will be open to the public on the last Saturday of every month, from 10am-4pm, starting on January 28.

chatgpt: The University of Edinburgh's Anatomy Museum has added two new artifacts to its collection. Death masks of Sir Walter Scott and Sir Isaac Newton are now on display for public viewing. The masks were created in the 19th century when it was common practice to make casts of people's faces after they had passed away. The concept behind the practice was to capture a person's likeness and preserve it for future generations. Sir Walter Scott was a Scottish historical novelist, poet, and playwright who lived from 1771 to 1832. He is best known for his series of novels set in Scotland, covering the histories of the clans and their struggles against the English. His works include The Heart of Midlothian, Waverley, and Ivanhoe. Scott's death mask was made shortly after he passed away from a stroke in 1832. The mask captures his distinctive features, including his prominent nose, heavy brow, and strong chin. Sir Isaac Newton, on the other hand, was an English mathematician, physicist, and astronomer who lived from 1642 to 1727. He is widely recognized as one of the most influential scientists of all time. Newton made significant contributions to the fields of calculus, optics, and mechanics. His death mask was made shortly after his passing in 1727. The mask portrays his famous features, including his intense gaze, angular jawline, and long, flowing hair. The addition of the death masks of Scott and Newton to the University of Edinburgh's Anatomy Museum is a significant one. The museum already houses an impressive collection of anatomical specimens, including skeletons and preserved organs. The museum also has a room dedicated to the history of surgery, which includes an exhibit on the famous Scottish surgeon Sir James Young Simpson. The death masks of Scott and Newton offer a unique glimpse into the lives of two of Scotland's most famous figures. They also provide visitors to the museum with an opportunity to see the physical features of these historical figures up close. Aside from the physical attributes, the death masks of Scott and Newton serve as a reminder of their lasting impact on history, literature, and science. The University of Edinburgh's Anatomy Museum is open to the public, and visitors are encouraged to come and explore its impressive collection. The museum is located in the Old Medical School, which originally opened in 1726. Aside from the death masks of Scott and Newton, the museum has many other interesting artifacts and exhibits that showcase the history of medicine, surgery, and anatomy. In conclusion, the University of Edinburgh's Anatomy Museum has added two new artifacts to its collection - the death masks of Sir Walter Scott and Sir Isaac Newton. The addition of these masks offers visitors a unique glimpse into the physical features of two of Scotland's most famous figures. It also serves as a reminder of their lasting impact on history, literature, and science. Visitors to the museum are encouraged to come and explore its impressive collection of anatomical specimens and other historical artifacts.
