A survey found almost two-thirds of us hate cold callers who address customers by their first name . Answering the phone halfway through dinner to a cold caller trying to sell you things you’ll never want or need is bad enough. What’s worse? When they use your first name to do it. Almost two-thirds of us hate cold callers who address customers by their first name and start conversations with ‘hi’, a study found. It concluded that the growing trend towards informality irritated the majority of people, who would rather be addressed properly by strangers. More than half would prefer to be addressed as Mr, Mrs or Miss rather than by their first names, the survey found. Nearly a third of the 1,000 polled said it annoyed them when someone they didn’t know called them by their first name. The figure was slightly higher among the over-60s. Three in ten said they were fed up with strangers, from cold callers to coffee shop workers,  treating them like friends. That included having their first name written on their takeaway coffee cup, a policy imported to Britain from the US by Starbucks. Twelve per cent of those surveyed said they did not like the practice. Almost a third said they resented receiving personalised emails from companies that were contacting them at random. Even those who use social media - a far more informal approach to communication - do not like the faux-friendliness of the networking sites. Nearly one in five objected to Facebook's 'how's it going?' messages on status bars where users post updates. People also objected to faux-friendliness on Facebook with a fifth disliking the 'how's it going?' message . And around a fifth said they did not like their bank using their first name rather than their full title in telephone conversations. The most traditional views were held in Wales, where 38 per cent said they disliked the growing informality of modern Britain. The most relaxed region was Scotland, where only 21 per cent said they were concerned. A spokesman for Ask Jeeves, which commissioned the survey, said: ‘There is nothing wrong with friendliness but it just doesn’t wash when it comes from someone you have never met or even spoken to. ‘Often these are people who are trying to sell you something and who have no other interest in you yet they treat you like a long-lost pal. ‘Britons are saying “enough is enough” and do not think it is old-fashioned to demand a bit of respect and to be called Mr, Mrs, or Miss by cold callers, sales staff and others.’ Unsurprisingly, older Britons dislike the trend most, with 62 per cent of the over-60s demanding to be called Mr, Mrs or Miss when addressed by strangers.

chatgpt: A new poll has found that three in ten people are fed up with strangers treating them like friends. The poll, carried out by YouGov, surveyed over 2,000 people across the UK and revealed that many people feel uncomfortable with the level of familiarity they experience from people they don't know. One in five respondents objected specifically to Facebook's "how's it going?" messages, which are often sent by people they have never met. This is just one example of the many ways that people are bombarded with unwanted familiarity from strangers. Interestingly, the poll also found that traditional views are more prevalent in Wales, while Scottish people are more relaxed. This could be due to societal differences between the two countries, or perhaps a reflection of differing attitudes towards privacy. The poll results highlight a growing trend of social discomfort, which may be a result of the way that social media has changed the way we interact with each other. With online platforms allowing people to connect with strangers from around the world, it's no wonder that some people are feeling overwhelmed with the level of familiarity that they are experiencing in their daily lives. Commenting on the poll results, Dr. Catherine Houlston, a psychology lecturer at the University of Edinburgh, said: "The results of this poll are very interesting and reflect a growing trend of social discomfort among people. It's possible that this is a result of the changing nature of our social interactions, with social media bringing people into contact with strangers on a regular basis." She continued: "It's important to remember that everyone has their own boundaries when it comes to social interaction, and it's important to respect those boundaries. If someone doesn't want to engage in conversation or be treated like a friend, that's their right." The poll also found that younger people were more likely to be comfortable with strangers treating them like friends, with only 16% of those under 24 objecting to Facebook's "how's it going?" messages. This further highlights the generational gap when it comes to social interaction and the impact that social media is having on our lives. Overall, the results of the YouGov poll show that many people are feeling uncomfortable with the level of familiarity they experience from strangers. While it's important to remain friendly and polite, it's equally important to respect people's boundaries and personal space.
