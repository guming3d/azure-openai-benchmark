article: Kenneth Harden, 32, was arrested on rape and torture charges . An Indiana man forced his wife to sign a sex slave contract so he could sexually abuse and torture her — while he coerced her by controlling her diabetes medication, police charge. Kenneth Harden, 32, is accused of binding his wife with ropes, forcing her to wear a choke collar and raping her repeatedly. He is charged with 38 felonies ranging from strangulation, criminal confinement and domestic battery, WHAS11 reported. Some of the charges stem from incidents that happened while his two kids were nearby, according to WBIW. Authorities say Harden wrote out an elaborate contract defining himself as the 'master' and his wife as the 'slave.' His wife said she couldn't leave not only because she 'loved him' — but also because he controlled the medication she needed for her severe diabetes, according to WHAS11. Seymour police arrested him on Saturday while responding to a domestic call at the couple's home. When officers arrived, they found Harden on the sidewalk while his distraught wife sobbed inside the apartment, WBIW reported. While investigating the call, police found an 11-page manual outlining 'the slave's role' and 'punishments,'  which was signed by both Harden and his wife in June, according to the station. The victim, who is not named because she was a victim of sexual abuse, said Harden forced her to sign the contract or he would leave her. She told cops that he was 'sweet' and 'swept her off her feet' when they first met via Craigslist in July 2013, according to WBIW. But soon he told her was a sadist and wanted to be her master, the station reported. The woman said he at times tied her to her bed for so long, she would urinate on herself, according to WBIW. She would often lose her consciousness during the torture sessions, court records show.
