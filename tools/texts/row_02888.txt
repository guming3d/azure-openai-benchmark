chatgpt: Residents of a quiet suburban street in Surrey were left shocked and terrified after an arson attack targeted the home of an elderly couple in the early hours of the morning. The perpetrator poured lighter fuel through the couple's letterbox before calmly setting fire to their front door. The couple, who have not been named, were asleep inside the house at the time of the attack but managed to escape unharmed thanks to the quick actions of their neighbours, who raised the alarm and helped them to safety. Police were called to the scene shortly afterwards and have launched an investigation. The attack, which is being treated as a seemingly motiveless crime, has left the community shaken and fearful, with many residents questioning whether they could be the next target. One neighbour, who wished to remain anonymous, said: "I couldn't believe it when I saw the flames coming from their house. It's terrifying to think that someone could do this to an innocent couple in their own home. I just hope the police catch whoever's responsible before they strike again." Detective Inspector Nick Bell, from Surrey Police, said: "This was a particularly callous and reckless attack, which put the lives of the elderly couple and their neighbours in danger. We are doing everything we can to identify the person responsible and bring them to justice." "Officers are currently carrying out door-to-door enquiries in the local area and we'd urge anyone who saw anything suspicious in the early hours of this morning to come forward and speak to us." The attack has also sparked calls for greater investment in community policing and support for vulnerable and elderly residents. Local councillor John Smith said: "This is a deeply concerning incident and our thoughts are with the couple at this difficult time. We need to do more to protect our most vulnerable residents and ensure that our communities are safe and secure." Residents have been urged to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the police. Meanwhile, the elderly couple are said to be receiving support from their family and friends as they come to terms with what could have been a devastating tragedy.
