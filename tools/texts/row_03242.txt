The police, supported by Liverpool City Council's Licensing Committee, want the match to start earlier. 'Merseyside Police do not support this fixture being played at 17.30 on Saturday February 7 2015 and reiterate our position that this fixture should have a kick-off time of no later than 1.30pm on a weekend,' said the police in a report to a special meeting of the ground safety advisory committee. Everton informed the Premier League of the police's objections on December 9 and the issue will be discussed on Tuesday afternoon by the council's licensing committee, which is set to also write to the Premier League with the proviso it 'will take legal advice on all appropriate options to enforce the position' in the event of no change of kick-off time being determined.

The police report stressed there was no specific intelligence indicating any organised disorder is planned but stated the wider implications of a late kick-off meant they had to take action now. 'I firmly believe that, the police, the clubs, and the city council have a responsibility to minimise the likelihood of those problems and their impact, not only on supporters within the footprint of the stadium, but also the wider community,' said the report. 'An evening kick-off time at a weekend is undoubtedly the most challenging and gives us the least chance of meeting our responsibilities. 'It is for this reason we, the police have specifically requested that this fixture should have a lunchtime kick-off.' Ã‚ .

chatgpt: The highly anticipated Merseyside Derby is set to take place on Saturday 7th February, with Everton hosting Liverpool at Goodison Park. However, there is growing concern about the safety of the fixture, as Merseyside Police have assessed the game as having a high risk of disorder. The fierce rivalry between the two local teams has a history of violence and aggression, and the police are taking extra precautions to ensure the safety of all those involved. They have advised fans to arrive early and cooperate with officers to prevent any incidents from occurring. Preparations for the game include a large police presence inside and outside the stadium, and increased security measures to restrict access to certain areas. The fixture has also caused controversy due to a disagreement between Liverpool City Council and the Premier League. The council is pushing for the game to start no later than 1.30pm, citing concerns about the potential for disorder in the evening. They have threatened to take legal action against the Premier League if they do not comply with their request. The council's concerns have been met with criticism from Liverpool fans, who argue that the timing of the game is not a significant factor in determining the risk of disorder. They see it as an attempt to restrict their freedom to enjoy the game and celebrate their team's victory, should they win. Despite these concerns, both Everton and Liverpool are determined to ensure that the game goes ahead without incident. They have appealed to their supporters to behave responsibly and respect the opposition, and have urged them to report any behaviour that could incite violence or disorder. The Merseyside Derby is one of the most high-profile fixtures in English football, and it is unfortunate that concerns about safety have overshadowed the excitement and anticipation surrounding the game. However, it is important that all parties involved take the necessary precautions to ensure that the fixture can be enjoyed by supporters, without any incidents of violence or disorder. As the game draws closer, fans will be eagerly anticipating the outcome of what promises to be a thrilling encounter. The eyes of the football world will be on Goodison Park on Saturday afternoon, and it is the hope of everyone involved that the day will pass without incident, allowing the focus to remain on the action on the pitch.
