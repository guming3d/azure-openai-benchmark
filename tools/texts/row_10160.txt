chatgpt: Former US President Barack Obama, 67, and his Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, 66, were reportedly taught how to use their mobile phones by their tech-savvy daughter, Chelsea. Chelsea revealed to The Telegraph how technology was a "mystery" to the powerful couple, and it was only with her help that they were able to get up to speed.  In an interview with the newspaper, Chelsea shared the story of how she helped her father create a playlist on his iPod, joking that it was the "most important thing" she had ever done for him. She also spoke about how she had helped her mother set up her email account on her new smartphone, despite the former First Lady's resistance to technology. "Everything was a mystery to both of them," Chelsea said. "My dad had never used an iPod before and my mom had never used an email before. So I really had to walk them through step by step." Chelsea's revelation highlights the continued importance of inter-generational learning when it comes to technology. As younger generations grow up with smartphones, social media, and other digital tools, their older relatives may struggle to keep up. However, as Chelsea demonstrated, a patient teacher can make all the difference. Chelsea, who is now 34, has a strong interest in politics and is reportedly considering running for office herself. She has spoken in the past about her parents' influence on her political beliefs and has been involved in a number of campaigns, including her mother's unsuccessful bid for the presidency in 2016. If Chelsea does decide to enter politics, she will no doubt bring her tech-savvy skills to the table. In an increasingly digital world, the ability to navigate social media and other online platforms is becoming essential for politicians who want to connect with voters. Overall, the story of Barack and Hillary's mobile phone troubles is a reminder that even the most powerful people in the world can struggle with technology. However, with a little help from the younger generation, anyone can learn to become a smartphone whizz.
