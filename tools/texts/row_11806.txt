article: A Mexican teenager has been charged with murdering his 17-year-old girlfriend and stuffing her body in a wardrobe after she found out he was seeing another woman. Student Yael Eduardo Espinosa Guerrero, 19, appealed for help finding his girlfriend Silvia Paredes Moedano after she went missing last week and even comforted her parents. But in reality Miss Moedano's body was hidden in Guerrero's bedroom after he allegedly strangled her to death when she told him their relationship was over. The body of Silvia Paredes Moedano, 17, was found hidden in her boyfriend's wardrobe days after she found out he was seeing another girl . Miss Moedano went to his home in Tultitlan, north of Mexico City, after she found out he was seeing another woman - Elia Carbajal Becerril, 22. It is then alleged that Guerrero throttled the 17-year-old to death and hid her body in his wardrobe. He is also said to have called Becerill for help hiding the body, which lay in the bottom of his closet for three days before it was found by police. After Miss Moedano went missing last Thursday, Guerrero told local newspapers: 'Wherever you are Silvia there are people here that miss you, please let us know you are alive and well.' Guerrero, 19, appealed for help finding his girlfriend Miss Moedano (pictured) for three days before her body was found in his bedroom . On Sunday, police officers interviewed Guerrero's parents to ask if knew where Miss Moedano might be, or if they had seen her before she disappeared. During the interview, an officer spotted the girl's handbag in the student's bedroom. It was then that they made the grim discovery of Miss Moedano's lifeless body in her boyfriend's wardrobe. Police spokesman Macabeo Garcia said: 'The handbag was found with blood stains on it and when they went to question the man when he arrived home, he ran off. 'When he was finally arrested he tried to pay officers cash to let him go again.' Guerrero was arrested and charged with murder as well as bribery. A post-mortem examination found that Miss Moedano died from strangulation after a violent attack. Becerril was also arrested for her involvement in the murder. Mr Garcia added: 'We are currently looking at the level of her involvement and in the meantime both are being held in custody.'

chatgpt: A young man from Mexico City has been charged with murder after his girlfriend's body was found stuffed in his wardrobe. Yael Eduardo Espinosa Guerrero, 19, is accused of strangling 17-year-old Silvia Paredes Moedano after she discovered he was seeing another woman. According to authorities, Miss Moedano went missing on October 18th, prompting a frantic search by family and friends. Guerrero is said to have joined in the search and even comforted her grieving parents, claiming he had no idea where she was. However, police soon discovered the gruesome truth: Miss Moedano's body had been hidden in Guerrero's wardrobe all along. It is believed he killed her in a fit of jealousy after she found out about his affair. Guerrero's lover, who has not been named, has also been arrested in connection with the murder. Investigators say she helped Guerrero cover up the crime by lying to police and disposing of evidence. The case has shocked residents of Mexico City, where femicides and violence against women are all too common. Thousands of women are killed each year in Mexico, and many more suffer from abuse and harassment. The country's government has faced criticism for its failure to tackle the issue, with activists calling for greater protection for women and harsher punishments for perpetrators. Miss Moedano's family and friends are still struggling to come to terms with her tragic death. She was a bright and promising young woman who dreamed of becoming a doctor. They say she was deeply in love with Guerrero and had no idea he was seeing someone else. Guerrero, who is currently in custody, has not yet entered a plea. His family say they are stunned by the allegations and cannot believe he could be capable of such a heinous crime. However, authorities say they have strong evidence linking him to the murder. The case is ongoing, and it remains to be seen what the ultimate outcome will be. However, one thing is clear: a young woman's life has been cut tragically short, and her loved ones are left to mourn her passing.
