article: (CNN)Protesters gathered at Kiev's Independence Square Sunday to march for peace, while fighting in Ukraine's east claimed more victims. Ukraine's President and prime minister were among those who attended the rally that had as its slogan "I am Volnovakha," in memory of the 13 passengers who died near the city of Volnovakha after their bus was hit by artillery shelling on January 13. "We will remember every Ukrainian hero who gave (life) for the sake of independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine," said Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. "We will not give up a single meter of our land." Meanwhile, fighting in the east continued. Government forces and pro-Russia rebels have been battling for control of eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions since April, after Russia annexed Ukraine's southeastern Crimea region the previous month. The Ukrainian army was able to regain full control of the Donetsk airport, military spokesman Col. Andriy Lysenko said Sunday. Over the last 24 hours, four Ukrainian soldiers were killed and 32 were wounded, the spokesman said. A 7-year-old boy and a 16-year-old were killed when a missile struck a house in the town of Vuhlehirsk, in Donetsk, said Donetsk's regional police chief Vyacheslav Abroskin on his Facebook page. A young girl was seriously injured. A ceasefire deal was reached on September 5 in Minsk, Belarus, following talks between representatives of Ukraine, Russia and rebel leaders. A subsequent agreement on September 19 set out more measures, but there has been little sign of progress as all sides blame each other for the bloodshed. The United Nations issued a statement Sunday, calling on all parties to exercise restraint. "The Secretary-General is alarmed by the severe escalation of fighting for control of Donetsk airport in eastern Ukraine, which has already caused numerous casualties and threatened to completely unravel a hard-won September 2014 cease-fire," it read. The statement continued: The Secretary-General stresses that further deterioration of a situation that has led to heavy loss of life and civilian suffering must be avoided at all costs. The United Nations stands ready to support all efforts toward de-escalation and the resumption of a genuine peace process to restore Ukraine's stability and territorial integrity." CNN's Laura Smith-Spark and Dana Ford contributed to this report.

chatgpt: After a fierce battle that has been lasting since April, the Ukrainian army has finally regained full control of the Donetsk airport. According to a spokesman of the military, the government forces have pushed out all the pro-Russia rebels that have been occupying the airport complex. The airport complex has been one of the major flashpoints in the ongoing conflict between the Ukrainian government and the pro-Russian separatists in the eastern region of Donetsk. The pro-Russian rebels have controlled the airport since they first seized it in 2014, but the Ukrainian army has been making concerted efforts to take back the airport for several months. The battle for the airport has been one of the bloodiest engagements in the entire conflict. The fighting has been intense, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. However, the government troops have gradually gained ground in the airport complex in recent weeks, and have now finally managed to get the upper hand and regain full control of the airport. The recapture of the airport is a significant victory for the Ukrainian government, as it restores control of a strategically important location that was once a major transport hub. The airport was a key asset for pro-Russian separatists, as it provided them with a vital supply line for weapons, ammunition, and troops. The Ukrainian government has said that it will now use the airport as a base for launching further operations against the rebels in eastern Ukraine. The army is reportedly preparing to launch a major offensive against separatist-held territory in the coming weeks. The conflict in eastern Ukraine has already claimed the lives of more than 13,000 people and displaced over 1.6 million since it first erupted in 2014. The fighting has intensified in recent months, with both sides blaming each other for the escalating violence. However, the recapture of the Donetsk airport is expected to give a boost to the Ukrainian army in their ongoing efforts to defeat the pro-Russian rebels and bring peace to the region. The Ukrainian government has said that it remains committed to finding a peaceful solution to the conflict, but will not hesitate to use force if necessary to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity. The international community has called on both sides to end the violence and resume peace talks, but with so much bloodshed on both sides, it remains to be seen whether a lasting peace agreement can be reached anytime soon.
