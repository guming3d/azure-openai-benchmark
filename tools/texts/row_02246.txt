chatgpt: Monkey Puzzle Nursery, located in North London, has recently been closed for two days due to temporary suspension of its registration by Ofsted. The closure occurred after an incident that is currently under investigation by the police, although no arrests have been made so far. The owners of the nursery have released a statement clarifying that the incident is not connected to any of the children who attend the nursery. However, the exact nature of the incident has not yet been disclosed to the public. According to a spokesperson for Ofsted, the suspension of the nursery's registration was due to "concerns about the safety and welfare of children." The spokesperson also stated that Ofsted is currently working closely with the local authority to ensure that appropriate safeguarding measures are in place for the children who attend the nursery. In response to the closure, a number of parents have expressed their concern and disappointment. One parent, who wished to remain anonymous, told reporters that they had always felt comfortable leaving their child at the Monkey Puzzle Nursery and were surprised to hear about the temporary closure. The Monkey Puzzle Nursery is a popular choice for parents in the area, with its staff receiving praise for their professionalism and dedication. The nursery provides childcare services for children aged between 3 months to 5 years, with a focus on early years education.
