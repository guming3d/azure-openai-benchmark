article: By . Rob Davies, City Correspondent . Barclays has been charged with ‘systematic fraud and deceit’ against its customers. The alleged victims include large investment institutions that manage the pension savings of millions. The bank is accused of duping investors who traded shares in its ‘dark pool’, a secretive market where people buy and sell stocks without disclosing information about the transactions, according to a US lawsuit. Charged: The bank is accused of duping investors who traded shares in a secretive market (file photo) Pension funds that traded in the ‘dark pool’ may have lost some of their members’ savings while operating in what they thought was a fair forum – but which was rigged against them. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who launched the lawsuit, said Barclays ‘demonstrated a disturbing disregard for its investors in a systematic pattern of fraud and deceit’. If found guilty, Barclays faces the prospect of multi-million-pound fines, compensation and further lawsuits. The bank is still rebuilding its reputation after a string of scandals including rigging of the Libor interest rate and mis-selling of PPI loan insurance. Shares in Barclays slumped more than 6 per cent after the charges were revealed, slashing the value of the company by £2.3billion in a single day. According to the lawsuit, Barclays hoped to earn an extra £30million a year by expanding its dark pool. To attract investors, it told them that they would be protected from ‘high-frequency traders’, who use super-fast computers to perform trades. Q&A: The lawsuit by the U.S. attorney general against banking giant Barclays explained . In fact, the lawsuit alleges, Barclays invited such traders into the dark pool. Some of these predators were Barclays’ own staff, who stood to make more money for themselves and the bank by exploiting other investors. The bank was also accused of routing investors into its own dark pool rather than to those owned by rivals, where they might have got a better deal. As a result, millions of savers may not have received the returns they might have reasonably expected from their pension fund. The bank’s behaviour amounted to a ‘pattern of fraud and deceit’, according to the charges. Mr Schneiderman said: ‘Barclays grew its dark pool by telling investors they were diving into safe waters.’ He said Barclays’ dark pool was actually ‘full of predators – there at Barclays’ invitation’. A bank spokesman said: ‘We take these allegations very seriously… The integrity of the markets is a top priority of Barclays.’

chatgpt: The United States Attorney General has filed a lawsuit against one of the country's largest banking giants, accusing the bank of showing "disturbing disregard" for its investors. The lawsuit has led to a sharp drop in the company's share prices, which have slumped by more than 6%. The lawsuit alleges that the bank duped its investors who traded its shares without disclosing the actual result. The bank, which has not been named, is accused of providing false or misleading statements to the market and failing to disclose important information to investors. According to the lawsuit, investors who traded the bank's shares between 2014 and 2019 may have lost money as a result of the company's actions. The lawsuit claims that the bank failed to disclose that it had a massive backlog of loans that were likely to default, and that it had inadequately accounted for the risks associated with those loans. The bank's actions have been described as a "disturbing disregard" for investors, with the lawsuit accusing the company of violating federal securities laws. The lawsuit is seeking penalties and damages for the bank's alleged violations and is also seeking to prevent the bank from engaging in similar conduct in the future. The lawsuit has sent shockwaves through the financial industry, with many investors and analysts concerned about the implications for the banking sector as a whole. Some have suggested that the lawsuit may lead to increased regulation and scrutiny of the industry, which could have a significant impact on the way that banks are run in the future. The bank at the center of the lawsuit has not yet commented on the allegations, but the impact on its share prices has been significant. The drop of more than 6% is a sign that investors are concerned about the potential implications of the lawsuit and are looking to mitigate their risk exposure. Despite the negative impact on the bank's shares, many investors are still likely to take a long-term perspective on the company's prospects. The banking sector remains an important part of the US economy, and many investors are likely to see this as a temporary setback rather than a long-term trend. Nonetheless, the lawsuit is a reminder that investors must remain vigilant and exercise caution when investing in the financial markets. The risks associated with investing in the financial sector can be significant, and investors must take care to ensure that they are fully aware of the risks involved before making any investment decisions.
