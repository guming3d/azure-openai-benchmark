article: Washington (CNN) -- Just a day before voters head to the polls, the New Hampshire Senate race is anyone's guess with the two candidates locked in a dead heat according to two new polls. Incumbent Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen edges out Republican challenger Scott Brown in a WMUR poll out Sunday while Brown is barely ahead of Shaheen by a one point margin in a New England College poll also out Sunday. Both results amount to a statistical tie with both leads within the polls' margin of error. The last word from the WMUR poll of 757 likely voters calls the race at 47% for Shaheen to Brown's 45% -- but 6% of voters say they remain undecided. The New England College poll of 1,526 likely voters gives Brown the race 49% to 48%, but says just 2% of voters are undecided. The race has tightened since the summer when Brown consistently trailed his opponent in every major nonpartisan poll. Brown has effectively closed the gap and his campaign has worked hard since the summer to tarnish Shaheen's independent brand by tying her to President Barack Obama, who pulls a 37% approval rating among the state's likely voters, according to the WMUR poll. Brown has also run several ads playing up the Ebola crisis and the threat from ISIS, saying in a September ad, "President Obama and Senator Shaheen seem confused about the threat, not me." While the race has tightened in Brown's favor, a larger share of voters' polled by WMUR said they believe Shaheen is most likely to pull through with a win -- 55% of respondents said Shaheen would triumph compared to 49% in October. Shaheen, meanwhile, who has served as both governor and senator in New Hampshire has touted her in-state credentials while branding Brown as an outsider. Brown served nearly three years representing Massachusetts in the U.S. Senate before moving to New Hampshire after losing his bid for reelection.

chatgpt: The final stretch of the New Hampshire Senate race is heating up, with two new polls released on Sunday showing the race in a dead heat. According to the WMUR poll, Democratic incumbent Sen. Jeanne Shaheen is ahead by just two percentage points. Her opponent, former Sen. Scott Brown, is close behind with 48 percent of the vote compared to Shaheen's 50 percent. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points. Meanwhile, the New England College poll shows Brown leading Shaheen by one percentage point, with 48 percent of the vote compared to Shaheen's 47 percent. This poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. The results of these polls underscore just how tight the race has become. Both Shaheen and Brown have been crisscrossing the state in recent weeks, trying to shore up support and sway undecided voters. Shaheen, who is seeking a third term in the Senate, has been emphasizing her record of supporting New Hampshire on a range of issues, from healthcare to jobs to education. She has also been hammering Brown on his conservative record, highlighting his past stances on issues like reproductive rights and climate change. Brown, who previously represented Massachusetts in the Senate, has been touting his working-class roots and promising to be a "New Hampshire senator" if elected. He has been emphasizing his support for small-business owners and veterans, as well as his opposition to Obamacare. The outcome of the New Hampshire Senate race could have significant implications for control of the Senate, as Republicans seek to pick up the six seats they need to gain a majority. If Brown were to win, it would be a major upset and a blow to Democrats' hopes of retaining control. With just a few days left until Election Day, both candidates will be working hard to turn out their supporters and sway those still on the fence. Whether Shaheen can hold onto her lead or Brown can pull off a surprise upset remains to be seen.
