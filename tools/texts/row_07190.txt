chatgpt: A rare and unexpected visitor has been discovered in Saltdean near Brighton. A creature was stuck underneath the RSPCA van and had to be rescued. The animal turned out to be a cheeky badger that initially sought refuge in another van before it was finally caught. The discovery of the elusive badger has generated interest among the local community and wildlife enthusiasts alike. The badger was found at the foot of a cliff, which only adds to the mystery surrounding its appearance. While there have been occasional sightings of badgers in the area, it is not common to find one near the cliffs. The rescue operation was launched by the RSPCA after a member of the public reported the animal's distress. As the RSPCA van approached the area, the badger ran underneath the vehicle, causing it to get stuck. In order to free the animal, the van had to be lifted up. At first, the badger had no intention of leaving its hiding place. It ran off to another van parked nearby, where it remained for some time.

In order to avoid any conflicts with wildlife, it is advised to keep a safe distance and avoid sudden movements. The discovery of the cheeky badger has added to the natural beauty of the area. Saltdean is known for its scenic beauty, and the presence of wildlife only enhances the charm of the place. It is hoped that the badger will find its way back to its natural habitat soon and that it will continue to thrive in the wild. The RSPCA has praised the efforts of the local community in assisting with the rescue operation. The badger's discovery has generated interest among the public, and it is hoped that people will continue to be vigilant when it comes to preserving the local wildlife.
