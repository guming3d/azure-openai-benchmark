article: Washington (CNN) -- Your little post office might be on a proposed list of closings coming out Tuesday as the U.S. Postal Service tries to find ways to cut red ink. Some would be replaced by a "Village Post Office" located within a commercial retail store. Postmaster General Patrick Donohoe planned a news conference Tuesday to release a long-awaited "post office study list" of potential closings nationwide, typically targeting rural post offices where only a few hundred customers are served. The facilities targeted, potentially numbering in the thousands, will be subject to a review and appeals process before any final decision is made. The list was developed based on low workload among post office employees, a small number of customers, and whether that location could be combined with other postal facilities nearby. The list to be released Tuesday has 3,653 facilities named, according to materials CNN obtained. They are categorized as follows: . GROUP 1: Less than $27,500 in annual revenue; less than 2 hours of workload daily (3,061) GROUP 2: Less than $600,000 in annual revenue; 5 or more access points within 2 miles (385) GROUP 3: Less than $1 million in annual revenue; 5 or more access points within 0.5 miles (188) GROUP 4: Offices currently suspended (19) Donohoe is also expected to provide details of a plan to increase joint marketing with other retailers as a way to improve customer access to postal services. A presentation obtained by CNN includes a drawing of a small grocery storefront, combined with signage suggesting the building is also a "Village Post Office," complete with signs featuring the stylized logo of the postal service. In May, Donohoe told CNN, "You've got a post office, a gas station, and a store; they're in a small town, the gas station and the store are struggling, we think we can provide service through contracts in many cases," that could cut operating costs for the Postal Service. Post office closings have upset some community leaders who say it could hurt their town's identity and make it difficult for the elderly to collect their mail and send letters. Some post offices, such as Laneview, Virginia, have already been notified they were under review and have held meetings to prepare to challenge any decision to close. "This post office is small," said Laneview manager Cynthia Reed-Fisher, "and from me working here the past two years, I was pretty sure that this post office would be on the list." Dozens attended a meeting at a church to tell the Postal Service why their location should be spared. Donohoe and other postal officials have told CNN the downsizing will try to preserve local town identities by maintaining their names and zip codes, and continuing to deliver that mail through other nearby facilities.

chatgpt: The United States Postal Service (USPS) is considering the closure of low-use post offices across the country, as part of a cost-cutting measure. As USPS struggles to keep up with the ever-increasing demand for electronic communication over traditional mail, the organization has been forced to reconsider its operations and make tough decisions. According to a recent USPS statement, a list of possible post office closures will be created and shared in the coming weeks. The list of potential closures is subject to appeal and review. The USPS has not yet released a timeline for when the closures would take effect, nor how many post offices may be affected. In addition to the potential closures, the USPS is also considering a plan for joint retail ventures with grocery stores and other businesses. This proposal is aimed at creating more convenient locations for individuals to mail packages and purchase stamps, while also increasing the USPS's revenue. With the explosion of online shopping and package delivery services, such as Amazon, the USPS has seen a surge in package delivery volume, increasing the need for more retail locations. The joint retail venture plan would involve partnering with businesses that are already established within communities, in areas that may not have a post office readily available. This could include small grocery stores or other retailers. The USPS hopes that by offering services through pre-existing businesses, it can reduce the cost of operating standalone post offices and increase its overall efficiency. It's important to note that any decision to close post offices would have an impact on both customers and employees. Customers relying on a local post office for their mail services would be forced to travel to a different location, which could be inconvenient for those living in rural areas. Employees at the potentially closing post offices could be faced with losing their jobs. USPS has been experiencing a long-standing financial crisis, which is a major reason for the current consideration of cutting post office operations. In 2019, the organization reportedly lost $8.8 billion in revenue, due to a decline in first-class mail and increased competition from private package delivery companies. This has led the USPS to explore alternative options to generate revenue and reduce costs. In addition to the joint retail ventures, the USPS has also proposed other measures to cut costs, including reducing delivery frequency, increasing postage prices, and consolidating processing facilities. All of these options are still being considered, and a final decision has not yet been made. Overall, the USPS is facing a significant challenge, and must find ways to stay competitive in a world where electronic communication dominates. As the USPS navigates these difficult decisions, it remains unclear what the future of the organization will look like, and how it will continue to operate in a constantly evolving world of mail and package delivery.
