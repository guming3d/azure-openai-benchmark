article: Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- Turkey's main opposition leader resigned as head of his party Monday after the circulation of a videotape allegedly showing him having an affair with a female party deputy who had once been his secretary. Deniz Baykal declared that "there is a conspiracy against me" and blamed the government for the video. The 71-year-old chairman of the Republican People's Party said the secretly shot tape could not have been made without the approval of the ruling party. "It is impossible to organize such a plot within such a short period of time without the knowledge of the ruling party," he said in a televised address. "One who gives credit to unlawful and unethical plots cannot defend law and ethics." The party is to elect a new leader at its convention May 23 and 24. Baykal has said he wouldn't be a candidate, but that won't stop members from trying to elect him again. Numerous party members are gathering signatures from delegates to renominate him as a candidate for leadership, saying they do not believe the accusations. And Baykal said, "My resignation doesn't mean I will give in to this conspiracy or will stop the fight." Members of parliament wept openly during the speech by Baykal, a representative from Antalya. Afterward, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he had ordered distribution of the tape halted. He added that he found Baykal's statements "just as ugly and worthless as the tape" and noted that Baykal had not denied its authenticity. The resignation of the secularist party leader comes as the government is preparing to take a package of proposed constitutional changes to a national referendum. The Republican People's Party opposes the changes. The chief prosecutor's office in Ankara has initiated a criminal investigation, according to Turkey's semi-official news agency Adnadolu Ajansi. CNN's Yesim Comert and Talia Kayali contributed to this story.

chatgpt: Former leader of the main opposition party in Turkey, Deniz Baykal, resigned on Sunday, blaming the government for allowing the secret video recording that forced him out of politics. In a news conference, Baykal stated that, "there is a conspiracy against me" and that he would not let the government manipulate the people of Turkey. Baykal has been a vocal critic of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's proposed constitutional changes, which would grant him sweeping powers. Baykal's resignation comes just weeks ahead of a referendum on the constitutional changes that he opposes. The referendum will take place on April 16th, and Erdogan has already begun campaigning for a "yes" vote. However, with Baykal's resignation, it is unclear how this will affect the outcome of the referendum. The video that led to Baykal's resignation was published online and showed him in a private conversation with a female politician. The video caused a scandal, as Baykal was married at the time, and is widely believed to have been released by government supporters. Baykal maintained that the video was doctored, but it still led to his downfall. Many in Turkey see Baykal's resignation as a blow to the country's democratic values. The opposition leader was a prominent figure in Turkish politics for over three decades and has been a steadfast defender of democracy and human rights. His resignation has been met with disappointment by many in the opposition, who fear that Erdogan will use his new powers to consolidate his grip on Turkish politics. The referendum on constitutional changes has become increasingly divisive in Turkey, with the two sides accusing each other of lying and manipulating the public. The proposed changes would abolish the position of prime minister and give the president sweeping powers to appoint judges, ministers, and senior officials without parliamentary approval. Erdogan has argued that the changes are necessary to strengthen the presidency and help combat terrorism, while Baykal and other opposition figures fear that they will lead to authoritarianism.  Despite Baykal's resignation, the referendum will still go ahead on April 16th. With emotions running high and tensions escalating, Turkey is entering a significant chapter in its history, and the future of its democracy hangs in the balance.
