chatgpt: Two robbers in Queensland, Australia, were foiled in their attempt to rob a jeweller's shop on New Year's Eve. The pair instead ended up in a KFC, where they staged a hold-up and made off with £1,000 in cash. According to eyewitnesses, the duo entered the KFC in Kallangur, a suburb of Brisbane, brandishing a weapon and demanding money from the staff. The staff immediately complied, handing over £1,000 in cash. The robbers then fled the scene, but not before being caught on CCTV cameras. The police were notified, and officers from the Queensland Police Service were quick to respond. They were able to apprehend the robbers a short time later, thanks in part to the CCTV footage. Both men were taken into police custody for questioning. The identities of the two robbers have not been released, but it is believed that they are local residents of the Kallangur area. The police have not revealed what type of weapon was used during the hold-up, or whether it has been recovered. Despite the robbery and the subsequent police response, there were no injuries reported at the KFC. The staff are said to have acted calmly and professionally during the incident, which helped to prevent the situation from escalating further. In a statement to the press, a spokesperson for KFC Queensland commended the staff, saying: "We are extremely proud of our team members for how they handled this incident and how they prioritized the safety of our customers and themselves. We are cooperating fully with police and would like to reassure our customers that we take their safety very seriously." The incident has provoked shock and outrage in the local community, with many residents expressing concern about the level of crime in the area. Some have called for increased police patrols, while others have suggested that more needs to be done to tackle the root causes of crime, such as poverty and unemployment. As of now, the investigation into the incident is ongoing, and the two robbers are expected to face charges in court. The police have thanked the public for their assistance in the case and have urged anyone with information to come forward.
