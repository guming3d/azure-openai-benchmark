Former player Patrick Vieira, who runs City's elite development squad, said: 'When we started training here with the boys I looked around and said "how amazing". 'I think this is one of the best, if not the best, facilities in the world,' he said of the 80-acre base that was previously a polluted brownfield site. 'If we go into the market and we compete to bring young players or first team players in, having a facility like this can only help. The training complex is linked to the club's Etihad Stadium by a long bridge that straddles Alan Turing Way . 'When you are a young, talented player from Manchester - or worldwide - you want the best possible facilities to challenge and improve yourself.' The complex is connected to the Etihad Stadium by bridge and houses all of the club's teams, from age-group sides to men's and women's senior squads - a total in excess of 450 individuals weekly. The first team will stay on site the night before home matches, while Vieira's elite development squad team and Manchester City Women will play at an integrated 7,000-capacity stadium. Frank Lampard and Sergio Aguero are among those who will be able to enjoy the new sleep-inducing wallpaper .
