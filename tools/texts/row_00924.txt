chatgpt: Actress Dara Tomanovich, 45, was charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI) after crashing her Porsche in New York City on July 16th. Tomanovich, known for her role in the movie Bio-Dome, reportedly told police officers responding to the scene that she was friends with former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and could get them fired. According to reports, Tomanovich hit a parked car and then fled the scene before authorities arrived. The actress was later caught and charged with DWI. She was taken into custody and released on bail. This is not the first time Tomanovich has had run-ins with the law. In 2017, she was arrested for driving under the influence and hitting a tree in the Hamptons. She was also charged with possessing a controlled substance without a prescription. The incident has sparked criticism from officials and members of the public. Mayor Bloomberg's spokesperson released a statement saying that "Ms. Tomanovich does not have any special relationship with the former mayor and her claims are baseless.” Many are also questioning the actress's judgment and decision-making skills. Driving under the influence is never an acceptable or safe behavior, and the fact that Tomanovich was allegedly attempting to use her connections to avoid being charged only adds to the seriousness of the situation. Tomanovich is scheduled to appear in court on August 20th for her charges. The consequences for DWI in New York City can range from fines and community service to jail time, depending on the severity of the offense and prior convictions. The incident serves as a reminder of the dangers of driving under the influence and the importance of taking responsibility for one's actions. It also highlights the potential consequences of abusing one's connections in an attempt to avoid accountability.
