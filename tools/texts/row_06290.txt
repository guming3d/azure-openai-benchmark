There was no immediate claim of responsibility but the Islamist rebel group al Shabaab has carried out a campaign of attacks over the past two and a half years in Mogadishu, underscoring the huge security challenges the government faces. Al Shabaab suicide bombers have targeted the Jazira hotel before, in an attack late last year. The al-Qaida-linked Islamic rebels frequently stage lethal attacks in Somalia near the seat of government and at sites popular with foreigners. In a radio message on Tuesday, a senior al-Shabab commander warned civilians to stay away from government buildings as well as sites controlled or owned by foreigners. The commander, Ali Mohammed Hussein, said attacks were imminent in Mogadishu. Al-Shabab once controlled Mogadishu, but it was ousted from the capital in August 2011. In September, the militants claimed responsibility for an attack on the Westgate Mall in neighboring Kenya that killed 67 people.

chatgpt: At least 17 people have been injured in a triple bomb blast that occurred outside the front of the Jazira hotel earlier today. The explosions occurred within an hour, causing chaos and panic in the heavily fortified area. The Jazira hotel is a popular destination for government officials and tourists in Mogadishu, Somalia. The explosions occurred near the hotel's main entrance, causing several cars parked outside to explode, and sending thick plumes of smoke into the air. Many people in the vicinity rushed towards the scene of the blasts to try and help the injured. The injured were quickly loaded into ambulances, and the critically injured were taken to the hospital. This isn't the first time that Al Shabaab has targeted the Jazira hotel. In July 2019, the same hotel was attacked, and at least 26 people were killed, with many others seriously injured. The terrorist group claimed responsibility for the July 2019 attack, and it is suspected that they may have been responsible for today's triple blasts as well. The hotel targeted in today's attack is located in a heavily fortified area, where many government offices and high-profile buildings are located. The area is under the tight control of the Somali military, and heavy security is maintained in and around the hotel. Despite such high levels of security, the triple blasts have raised serious questions about the government's ability to provide adequate security in the face of an ever-present terrorist threat. It is still unclear who is responsible for the attack, but Al Shabaab is suspected to be behind it. In recent months, the group has been on the rise, carrying out numerous attacks in the capital city and elsewhere in the country. The group is known for its tactics of using suicide bombers and other weapons to cause mass casualties. The triple blasts have sent shockwaves through the capital city and have caught the attention of the international community. The United Nations has condemned the attack, and several countries have expressed their solidarity with the people of Somalia. The Somali government has vowed to take action against the perpetrators of the attack and has urged the public to stay vigilant and report any suspicious activity. In the meantime, the injured are receiving treatment in hospitals across the city, with many in critical condition. In conclusion, the triple bomb blasts at the Jazira hotel earlier today have once again highlighted the dangerous security situation in Somalia. The government must take decisive action to prevent further attacks and ensure that the people of Somalia can live in peace and security.
