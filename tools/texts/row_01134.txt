Researchers have discovered red wood ants prefer to build their colonies along active faults, fractures where the Earth ruptures, in Germany. Gabriele Berberich, of the University of Duisburg-Essen, in Germany, said the behaviour of the ants significantly changed before an earthquake above magnitude 2.0 hit the area. Their behaviour did not return to normal until a day after the earthquake. Sense: Red wood ants (pictured) significantly change their behaviour before an earthquake, researchers have discovered . Colony: The researchers tracked the ants round the clock for three years between 2009 and 2012 . Berberich presented her research at the European Geosciences Union annual meeting, in Vienna,Â LiveScience has reported. Her team, who counted 15,000 ant mounds lining the active faults, tracked the ants round the clock for three years between 2009 and 2012. The team discovered the ants would undergo their usual activities during the day before retreating into their mound at night. But before an earthquake, the ants would stay awake and remained outside the mound during the night, leaving them vulnerable to predators. The research suggested the ants only changed their behaviour when the earthquake was over magnitude 2, which is the smallest earthquakes humans can feel. Berberich has suggested the insects are able to predict the earthquakes by picking up changing gas emissions or shifts in the Earth's magnetic field. Communication: Red wood ants, pictured here communicating by touching antennae, prefer to build their colonies along active faults, the team found . Damage: Buildings damaged by an earthquake in Mirandola, near Modena, in May last year . Berberich said: 'Red wood ants have chemo receptors for carbon dioxide gradients and magneto receptors for electromagnetic fields. 'We're not sure why or how they react to the possible stimuli, but we're planning on going to a more tectonically active region and see if ants react to larger earthquakes.' The Times of India has reported Berberich and her colleagues are hoping to continue their research in areas where larger earthquakes are more common.

chatgpt: A new study has found that ants in Germany have an unusual preference for building their colonies along active faults. Researchers have also discovered that the insects' behavior significantly alters before an earthquake. The study highlights the potential of ants for detecting changes in the earth's crust prior to seismic events. According to the study published in the journal "Current Biology," researchers observed the behavior of ants in the area around the active fault line in Germany's Rhine Valley. The team discovered that the ants living near the fault line showed a significant change in their behavior before the area experienced an earthquake. They would abandon their nests or stop their foraging activities a day before the earthquake occurred. The researchers pointed out that the ants' behavior only returned to normal a day after the earthquake, suggesting a change in the environment or physiological changes in the ants that resulted in their altered behavior. There are a number of hypotheses which could explain the ants' response, including the possibility that ants can pick up changing gas emissions or shifts in the earth's magnetic field. The researchers highlighted that ants' sensitivity to changes in their environment is well-known, and they can detect changes in temperature, humidity, and even the air pressure. However, this is the first time that such a close association has been identified between ants and earthquakes. The study has important implications for understanding how insects can detect natural disasters, including earthquakes. Earthquakes are notoriously difficult to predict, and the current methods have limited accuracy. If we can better understand the behavior of animals before an earthquake, we may be able to develop better early warning systems for these devastating natural disasters. The study also has potential implications for urban planning, as the findings suggest that the presence of ants in an area could indicate increased earthquake risk. Identifying such a risk factor could help inform decisions about building codes or evacuation plans in the event of an earthquake. Overall, the study is significant for the insights it provides into the complex interplay between the environment and animal behavior. It highlights the potential of insects like ants to provide valuable clues about the natural world and opens new avenues for research into earthquake prediction and risk assessment.
