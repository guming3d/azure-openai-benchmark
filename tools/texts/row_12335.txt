article: (CNN) -- Authorities evacuated a Bermuda-bound flight at Philadelphia International Airport in Pennsylvania Thursday after one of three people loading the plane didn't appear to belong and suddenly left the area, police said. It appeared that the man in question was properly credentialed to be in a secure area, but was working on a plane that he wasn't supposed to, FBI spokesman J.J. Klaver said. When he was questioned by the other baggage handlers, the person left in a baggage loading cart, he said. US Airways Flight 1070 -- which police said was bound for Bermuda with 102 passengers and five crew members -- was towed to a secure part of the airport, where baggage was removed from the plane to be screened by bomb-sniffing dogs. The plane tested negative for explosives, and the incident is not believed to be terror-related, said Klaver. The investigation was ongoing, he added. In addition, no narcotics were found on board the plane, said Stephen Sapp of Customs and Border Protection. "There's nothing explosive, nothing hazardous," Klaver said. He also said that there was no apparent failure in airport security processes. Flight 1070 finally departed for Bermuda nearly six hours late. Federal and local police at the airport had been searching for a man in uniform who was not wearing identification on the tarmac, a law enforcement official told CNN. "This could be a suspicious person or it could be nothing," the official said. The rest of the airport was fully operational and not affected by the incident, said spokeswoman Victoria Lupica. The passengers remained in the terminal, said Todd Lehmacher, spokesman for US Airways. The airline hoped to get them back on the plane and headed for Bermuda once authorities allow it, he said. CNN's Carol Cratty, Jeanne Meserve, Ross Levitt and Deborah Feyerick contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Passengers of a US Airways flight bound for Bermuda experienced a nearly six-hour delay on Monday. The flight, US Airways Flight 1070, was scheduled to depart from the Philadelphia International Airport at 8:20 a.m., but actually took off at approximately 1:00 p.m.  According to airport officials, there was no failure in airport security that caused the delay. The incident is not believed to be terror-related.  The flight was carrying 102 passengers, all of whom had to wait at the airport for several hours. Some passengers took to social media to express their frustration with the delay, with one traveler tweeting, "What's going on? They're not telling us anything."  The airline has not yet disclosed the reason for the delay. In a statement, US Airways apologized for the inconvenience caused to their passengers and stated that they were working to get them to their destination as soon as possible.  This is not the first time US Airways has experienced delays. In March of this year, the airline faced criticism after a flight was delayed for over eight hours due to mechanical issues.  According to a recent report by the U.S. Department of Transportation, US Airways ranks among the worst airlines in terms of on-time performance. In May of this year, the airline reported an on-time arrival rate of 76.7%, down from 82.1% in May of 2014.  Passengers on US Airways Flight 1070 eventually arrived safely in Bermuda, albeit several hours later than planned. The incident serves as a reminder of the frustrations that often come with air travel, and highlights the need for airlines to improve their on-time performance and communication with their customers.
