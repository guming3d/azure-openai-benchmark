article: They are the must-see landmarks in cities across the world. So the likes of the Eiffel Tower, the Empire State Building and Big Ben have to look good all year round - and the clean-up mission for each of these huge structures is on a massive scale. At 1,000ft high, The Shard in London boasts 11,000 glass panels, which take four weeks to clean - and costs £130,000 each year, according to a new infographic. The mammoth task of cleaning the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France, requires 105 gallons of metal cleaning solution . In the US, the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC gets blasted with a power washer twice a year, while Paris's Eiffel Tower gets a bath once a year - requiring 105 gallons of metal cleaning solution, four tonnes of wipes and 25,000 bin bags. Compiled by hassle.com, the graph - entitled The World's Biggest Clean-Ups - also reveals how cleaners hang from harnesses to clean the 1,450ft-high Empire State Building in New York, and how the 312 pieces of opal glass on Big Ben's four clocks in London get a rinse every five years. The Taj Mahal in India gets a mud wash every seven years; The Gherkin in London takes 10 days to clean; 40 different cleaning methods were tested on the Acropolis in Athens, Greece, before finding the best one; and 90C water is used to blast 50 years of dirt and bird droppings from the Space Needle in Seattle. And then spare a thought for the cleaning teams who have to  tidy after the famous La Tomatina 'tomato-pelting' festival in Valencia or the UK's legendary Glastonbury Festival. Music festivals are enjoyed by thousands who get a chance to let their hair down - and their rubbish. After the 2014 Glastonbury Festival a team of 800 litter-pickers were used across the 1,200-acre site - and it took six weeks to clean. And it's a similar story for V Festival where 90,000 music lovers drop 150 tonnes of litter. Despite recycling bags being handed out, the clean up is an enormous task. Over the water, the Uranium mine clean-up in Navajo, New Mexico, US, is a shuddering challenge. Two piles radioactive dirt remain after the kine has served its purpose, and estimates are that it will cost £50m to clean and take 100 years.

chatgpt: In Rome, the Colosseum has a very unique and traditional cleaning method. This ancient Roman amphitheater is cleaned using only toothbrushes and water! This may seem like a tedious and labor-intensive process, but the traditional method has been used for over 2,000 years. The Colosseum is a popular tourist attraction and draws thousands of visitors each day. However, with so much foot traffic, the arena requires regular cleaning to maintain its beauty and integrity. The traditional method of cleaning involves using just water and a few toothbrushes to scrub away any dirt, grime, or debris that collects on the ancient structure. Although it may appear to be a slow and daunting task, the method has proven to be effective in maintaining the Colosseum's beauty and reputation. Tourists and locals alike admire the ancient structure and appreciate the preservation efforts taken to ensure the Colosseum remains in top condition for future generations. In Reading, England, the V Festival of music is causing a different kind of cleaning challenge. The festival, which draws in thousands of music fans each year, creates a staggering 150 tons of rubbish annually. The waste includes discarded food, drink containers, and other garbage. The large amount of rubbish created each year poses a significant challenge for the organizers of the festival. They must take proactive measures to reduce waste and ensure a more sustainable event in the future. One solution includes providing more recycling bins and encouraging attendees to responsibly dispose of their waste. Despite the challenging issue of waste management, the V Festival remains a popular destination for music fans and continues to attract visitors from all over the world. The challenge of sustainability is a global issue, and festival organizers are setting an example for other events to follow. In New Mexico, a very different kind of cleaning challenge exists. Disused radioactive mines from the Cold War era are in desperate need of cleaning up. The cleanup could take upwards of 100 years, as the mines are located in remote and hard-to-reach areas. The uranium mines were once used as a source of fuel for nuclear warheads. However, now they pose a significant health risk to the surrounding areas and must be cleaned up. The long process involves excavating the contaminated soil and installing protective barriers to prevent further contamination. Although the cleanup efforts may be slow and arduous, it is crucial in protecting the health of the surrounding environment and its inhabitants. The efforts taken to clean up radioactive waste serve as a reminder of the lasting effects nuclear weapons can have on a society. In conclusion, cleaning is an essential and necessary part of maintaining any structure, event or environment. The unique methods used to clean the Colosseum in Rome, the sustainability efforts at music festivals, and the ongoing cleanup of radioactive waste all serve as reminders of the challenges and importance of cleaning efforts in today's society.
