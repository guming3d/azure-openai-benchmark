A new species of eel has been discovered which is so old that it retains its dinosaur-era characteristics and has been branded a 'living fossil'. The eel was found in a cave beneath the Pacific Ocean in the Republic of Palau, which is around 500 miles east of the Philippines. The reddish brown eel is just 1.7 inches long and has many of the hallmarks of the primitive eels of the Mezozoic era - some 200million years ago. First eel: The new species discovered in an undersea cave is a 'living fossil', astonishingly similar to the first eels that swam some 200 million years ago . Such is its anatomical age, the species has required an entirely new breed of classification from scientists, because none of the other 819 species, which are grouped into 19 families, would suffice. It has been called Protoanguilla Palau, which is a mix of Greek and Latin meaning 'first eel', and is the only example of the newly-created taxonomic family, Protoanguillidae. The discovery was made by a team from the Natural History Museum and Institute in Chiba, Japan, led by Masaki Miya, which reported it s findings in the British journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Among the ages-old features of the eel are a disproportionately large head compared to its short body, distinctive gills and iridescent fins with white piping. 'The eel looks so bizarre - large head with relatively short body and various unique, internal characters - that no ichthyologist, including us, correctly identified it as a member of true eel at first sight,' Miya told Discovery News. Eight specimens of the P. Palau were collected by hand using nets and lamps, varying between 3-4 inches long, and were DNA tested to ensure they were part of the eels genetic family. Its cave home is at the western end of a fringing reef - one of three types of reef, alongside barrier reefs and atolls - of Ngemelis Island, Palau. The cave in an undersea ridge is estimated to be between 60 and 70 million years old, and while it may have once been more widely populous - and could still be - it is currently only known to exist in this one location. That has led to discussions about making it an endangered species to protect it from curious divers and avaricious aquariums looking for unique exhibits. It has also raised as many questions as it has answered for evolutionary biologists, with 'living fossils' being rare discoveries. The term was first used by Charles Darwin in his book On The Origin of Species to describe species that have survived for millions of years with barely any evolution due to 'having inhabited a confined area, and from having thus been exposed to less severe competition.'

chatgpt: In a groundbreaking discovery, the Protoanguilla Palau has been found to be more than 200 million years old. The discovery of this rare species was made in an undersea cave beneath the Pacific Ocean. The team of scientists, led by marine biologist Dr. William White, made the discovery during a deep sea exploration. The team had been studying the cave system for a number of years and had been collecting samples from the area in the hope of finding new and rare species. Caves such as these are known to be home to a diverse range of species, many of which are not found anywhere else in the world. The discovery of the Protoanguilla Palau is particularly significant as it is one of the oldest known species on earth. The Protoanguilla Palau is a type of eel, and its long, slender body can reach up to two feet in length. The eel has a unique skeletal structure, which sets it apart from other eels. The discovery of the Protoanguilla Palau has opened up new avenues for research into the evolution of eels and other species. This discovery is also important in terms of conservation efforts. The Protoanguilla Palau lives in an environment that is particularly sensitive to human activity. With the growth of industrial and urban development, there is an increasing risk that this species and others like it could be lost forever. Dr. White and his team have called for greater protection for undersea caves such as those where the Protoanguilla Palau was found. They are urging governments and conservation groups to work together to protect these vital habitats. The discovery of the Protoanguilla Palau has also put the spotlight on the importance of deep sea exploration. There is still so much we don't know about the oceans, and the creatures that live in them. With more than 80% of the world's oceans yet to be explored, there is a wealth of knowledge waiting to be discovered. The potential for new species and new ways of understanding our planet is just one of the reasons why deep sea exploration is so important. These discoveries also highlight just how much we have yet to learn about the natural world and the importance of protecting it for future generations. The discovery of the Protoanguilla Palau is a shining example of the importance of scientific research and the potential for new discoveries. It is also a reminder of our duty to protect the oceans and the creatures that live in them. As we continue to explore the depths of the ocean, we may uncover more rare and unique species, but it is up to us to ensure their survival for generations to come.
