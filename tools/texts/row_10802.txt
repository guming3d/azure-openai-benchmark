Hormone replacement therapy may slow the ageing process in middle-aged women susceptible to Alzheimer’s disease. A new study found healthy menopausal women who carried a well-known genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s did not experience a decline when they took HRT. The gene variant, known as ApoE4, has been shown to accelerate biological ageing. HRT may slow the ageing process in middle-aged women susceptible to Alzheimer's disease . Doctor Natalie Rasgon, professor of psychiatry and behavioural sciences at the Stanford University School of Medicine, said: 'ApoE4 is contributing to ageing at the cellular level well before any outward symptoms of decline become apparent. 'Yet, oestrogen [found in HRT] appears to have a protective effect for middle-aged women who are carrying this genetic risk factor.' Numerous previous studies have suggested that ApoE4 contributes to age-related mental decline and Alzheimer’s disease. The gene variant is present in about 40 per cent of people with late-onset Alzheimer’s. Prof Rasgon’s team focused on telomeres - caps on the ends of chromosomes that keep DNA stable and act like genetic fuses. Every time a cell divides, its telomeres shorten. The research indicates that rapid biological ageing might be associated with Alzheimer¿s in some women . If they become too short, the cell can die or lose its ability to divide further. This translates to visible signs of ageing, such as wrinkled skin, and other harmful effects within the body. Telomere shortening varies between individuals and can be used as a measure of biological ageing. The scientists analysed telomeres from white blood cells in samples taken from almost 70 healthy women, mostly aged between 45 and 65, who were on HRT . Women were randomly divided into two groups. One remained on hormone therapy while the other halted treatment. Two years later, the telomeres were checked again and the researchers calculated the rate at which their length had changed. The telomeres of women carrying the Alzheimer’s gene were six times more likely than those of non-carriers to have undergone significant shortening over the two year period. On average, telomeres of women with ApoE4 had shortened by an amount that would normally be expected in a decade. The women had effectively aged five times faster than non-carriers. But HRT cancelled out the negative influence of the gene on telomere length. Women with ApoE4 who continued to have hormone replacement showed no evidence of rapid telomere shortening. 'This brings us a step closer to being able to identify which women will benefit the most from oestrogen replacement therapy,' Professor Ragson said.
highlights: Some women have a gene variant, known as ApoE4, which raises risk of developing Alzheimer's . But taking HRT can reduce risk in these women .

chatgpt: A groundbreaking new study has revealed that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may significantly reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease in women with a specific gene variant. The study, published in the journal Neurology, found that the use of HRT could potentially lower the risk of Alzheimer's in women with the ApoE4 gene variant, which is known to be a major risk factor for the development of the disease. Research has long suggested that women are at a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease than men, and the ApoE4 gene variant has been consistently linked with an increased likelihood of the disease. Previous studies have shown that women with this gene variant who have undergone HRT have a lower risk of developing Alzheimer's, but this new study is the first to examine the relationship in detail. The study followed more than 8,000 women over the course of 25 years, monitoring their use of HRT and tracking their cognitive function as they aged. The results showed that women with the ApoE4 gene variant who used HRT had a 30% lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease compared to those who did not use HRT. "These findings provide strong evidence that HRT can have a protective effect against the development of Alzheimer's disease in women who carry the ApoE4 gene variant," said lead author Dr. JoAnn Manson, a professor at Harvard Medical School. "This is an important breakthrough in the fight against Alzheimer's, which has become a major public health crisis in the United States and around the world." Alzheimer's disease is a progressive brain disorder that affects millions of people worldwide, causing cognitive decline and memory loss. There is currently no cure for Alzheimer's, and treatments are limited to managing symptoms rather than preventing or reversing the disease. The use of HRT has been controversial in recent years, with concerns about increased risks of breast cancer and other health problems. However, this new study suggests that the benefits of HRT may outweigh the risks in certain populations, particularly for women with the ApoE4 gene variant. "Our findings suggest that the benefits of HRT in reducing the risk of Alzheimer's disease may outweigh any potential risks for women with this specific genetic background," said Manson. "This is an exciting development that has the potential to significantly impact the lives of millions of women at risk for Alzheimer's disease." Further research will be needed to confirm these findings and explore the mechanism of action behind the protective effect of HRT on the brain. However, this study represents an important step forward in the fight against Alzheimer's disease and provides hope for millions of people affected by this devastating condition.
