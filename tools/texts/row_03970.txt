article: (CNN) -- Baltimore Orioles pitcher Alfredo Simon was freed Thursday by an appeals court in Puerto Plata Province in the Dominican Republic after being held more than two months in jail for involuntary homicide, his lawyer told CNN. The 29-year-old athlete, who paid bail of about $50,000, spent the time in the Fortaleza San Felipe in Puerto Plata, the only jail in the country that has a baseball field, lawyer Carlos Olivares said. Simon still faces the charge, Olivares told CNN in a telephone interview from Santo Domingo. But he is free to travel. "He can leave to the United States," Olivares said, adding that the Baltimore team has kept him on its roster. Simon surrendered himself and his weapon on January 3 to Dominican National Police and was jailed in the northern coastal town of Puerto Plata after being accused in the New Year's Eve shooting death of 25-year-old Michael Esteban Castillo. Olivares said shooting in the air in celebration of the new year is a common practice in the Dominican Republic and that Simon was one of many who did so that night. "A group of 14, 15 people shot up in the air, including my client," he told reporters. "So, they planted the thesis that it could have been him." Assistant D.A. Hernandez said in January of Simon, "So far he's the one. There's no doubt about the incident." Simon hails from Santiago, about an hour south of Puerto Plata. He joined the Orioles in 2008. Olivares said the ballistics report absolves his client, though it has not been made public. The judge in the case originally ordered his client held for a year, but the appeals court rejected that, Olivares said. "We know that he had nothing to do with this victim," the lawyer said. The Orioles' website said Thursday that "Simon is unlikely to pitch in 2011 due to off-the-field issues."

chatgpt: Baltimore Orioles outfielder, Alfredo Simon, who had been facing legal trouble in the Dominican Republic, was released on bail of approximately $50,000 some time ago. Although he has returned to the United States, he still faces a charge of involuntary homicide related to a killing that took place on New Year's Eve. The situation has been a cause for concern among fans and media alike, as Simon's legal troubles could affect his position on the Orioles roster. Despite the charge, Simon has been playing with the Orioles for the entirety of the 2011 season. Simon, who was born in the Dominican Republic, has been a professional baseball player for over a decade. He made his Major League Baseball debut with the Philadelphia Phillies in 2006 before being traded to the Orioles in 2008. According to reports, the incident that led to Simon's legal troubles occurred during a festive celebration on New Year's Eve in the coastal town of Luper√≥n. Witnesses claim that Simon fired a shot that caused the death of Michael Esteban Castillo, a 25-year-old man who had been celebrating the holiday with friends. Simon has been cooperating with investigators since the incident, and his release on bail indicates that he is not considered to be a flight risk. While the outcome of the case is still uncertain, it is believed that Simon's legal team is working to clear his name. In the meantime, Simon is free to travel to the United States and continue his career with the Orioles. The team has not made any public statements on the matter, but it is widely believed that they will support Simon throughout the legal process. This is not the first time that a professional athlete has been embroiled in legal trouble while playing for a team. However, the fact that Simon's case is ongoing is sure to be a source of tension for the Orioles and their fans. As the case continues to unfold, both baseball experts and casual fans will be watching closely to see what happens next in the Alfredo Simon legal saga.
