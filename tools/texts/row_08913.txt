article: A family of rabbits are believed to be responsible for unearthing an 8,000-year-old archaeological 'gold mine' near Land's End. A haul of Stone Age arrow heads and flint tools found in a freshly dug network of rabbit warrens less than 200 yards from the Cornish landmark has led archaeologists to plan a full excavation of the site. Although a formal dig of the 150-acre area is yet to begin, initial analysis suggests there could be a large Neolithic cemetery, Bronze Age burial mounds and an Iron Age hill fort buried there. Treasure: A family of rabbits are believed to be responsible for unearthing an 8,000-year-old archeological 'gold mine' near Land's End . Artifacts: Among the items brought to the surface by the family of rabbits were these Neolithic flint tools . Land's End has long been considered an area of historical interest as the spectacular views have led to a disproportionately large number of important people being buried there over several thousand years. Although there are a number of important archeological sites in the local area, the latest Land's End dig will almost certainly be the first prompted by a family of rabbits. The excavation of the site will be managed by a team from Wirral-based archaeologists Big Heritage. Team leader Dean Paton, 30, told the . Mirror: 'It seems important people have been buried here for thousands . of years - probably because of the stunning views. [But] it's a . million-to-one chance rabbits should make such an astounding find.' Land's End has long been considered an area of historical interest. Big Heritage now plan to spend the next two years excavating the site . Mr Paton says the rabbits dug two small burrows right next to each, dragging a number of historical artifacts to the surface as they did so. He added: 'No one knows the scale of it, but it's a gold mine. A family of rabbits has just rewritten the history books.' Big Heritage now plan to spend the next two years excavating the site.

chatgpt: An archaeological discovery considered to be a "gold mine" in the UK may hold the secrets of an ancient burial ground. According to reports, a team found rare artifacts while excavating what they believed to be the site of an Iron Age village in a Lincolnshire field. However, just as they were about to pack up and leave, rabbits living in the area started kicking objects into the air while digging their burrows. The team quickly realized that these objects could be of immense archaeological value, and soon found evidence of Stone Age graves in the area. Following the discovery, the team now believes that they may have stumbled upon an ancient cemetery that dates back to the Stone Age. The team, consisting of archaeologists, researchers, and volunteers, plans to excavate the site for the next two years in search of further clues. The excavation could yield a wealth of information about our ancestors, as ancient cemeteries often provide valuable information about their social customs, religious beliefs, and way of life. The team is expecting to find more artifacts and remains, which could paint a vivid picture of life thousands of years ago. Speaking about the discovery, the lead archaeologist said, "This find is incredibly exciting. It is rare to come across a site of such immense archaeological significance. We believe that this may have been a significant burial ground dating back to the Stone Age period, which could reveal a great deal about our ancestors and how they lived." The excavation process has already begun, with the team using the latest technology and techniques to carefully uncover the artifacts and remains while preserving their integrity. Everything found will undergo rigorous testing and analysis to determine their age, origin, and significance. The discovery of the potential Stone Age cemetery is a reminder that our history is constantly revealing new insights and secrets, and that even the smallest of finds can broaden our understanding of our past. For the team of archaeologists, researchers, and volunteers involved in this project, the excavation of this site could be the find of a lifetime.
