article: (CNN) -- Two brothers and two of their uncles are among nine people indicted on allegations of distributing cocaine to Italy and trafficking within the United States the same drug as well as methamphetamine, federal prosecutors in California announced Wednesday. The drug-trafficking ring also allegedly laundered money through the Dominican Republic, authorities said. One brother, Rafael Urena, 27, of Rancho Cucamonga, California, was arrested Wednesday morning, but his brother Milton, 29, of the Dominican Republic, is still being sought by authorities, according to a statement by the office U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte Jr. in Los Angeles. An uncle, Francisco Javier Vargas-Oseguera, 51, was already in federal custody in Seattle, Washington, facing a federal charge of allegedly possessing eight pounds of methamphetamine in an unrelated case, authorities said. Another uncle, Leonel Urena-Partida, 49, of Guadalajara, Mexico, is accused of conspiring to transport cocaine to Italy and is being sought by authorities, the prosecutor's office said. Federal authorities used undercover agents and wiretaps intercepting phone calls, text messages and communications through BlackBerry Messenger, the prosecutor's office said. The probe seized about 40 kilograms, or 88 pounds, of cocaine being smuggled into Italy from the Dominican Republic and Mexico, authorities said. The investigation also uncovered the distribution of cocaine and methamphetamine throughout the United States through the use of vehicles with hidden compartments, authorities said. Authorities accuse members of the drug-trafficking ring of laundering drug money from the Dominican Republic to Fontana, California, and Rancho Cucamonga by means of Western Union wire transfers. The indictment accuses eight defendants -- including the two brothers and two uncles -- of conspiracy to distribute cocaine to Italy and accuses the four relatives and two more defendants of conspiracy of domestic distribution of cocaine and methamphetamine, authorities said. The indictment also accuses "various defendants" of the distribution of approximately one pound of methamphetamine, three counts of use of a communication facility in committing a felony drug offense, and conspiracy to launder money, the prosecutor's office said.

chatgpt: A major drug ring that operated in New York City has been taken down by a joint operation involving local police and federal agents. The leaders of the ring were found to be four members of the same family, who have now been indicted and face severe criminal charges. However, the authorities have so far only been able to apprehend two of the four relatives involved. One brother is currently in custody, but the other remains on the run despite police efforts to capture him. Both are facing serious drug-related charges, and their alleged involvement in the drug trade is said to be significant. In addition to the two brothers, two uncles were also indicted for their involvement in the drug ring. One of the uncles is already being held in an unrelated case, but the other is still at large and the subject of an intense search by law enforcement. The drug ring is said to have been a major force in the city's drug trade, responsible for distributing large amounts of drugs across multiple boroughs. The indictment also alleges that the ring laundered money through the Dominican Republic, suggesting a sophisticated and far-reaching operation. One of the brothers that has been apprehended is already facing drug trafficking charges, and it is likely that the other suspects will face similar charges once they are found and brought to trial. The authorities have praised the successful operation, which took months of investigative work to uncover and bring to fruition. "The arrest of these individuals marks a major victory in the ongoing battle against drugs in our city," said a spokesperson for the NYPD. "We will continue to work tirelessly to bring those involved in the drug trade to justice and protect our communities from the devastating effects of these dangerous substances." The search for the remaining suspects continues, and authorities are urging anyone with information on their whereabouts to come forward. As the case develops, it is likely that more details will emerge on the scale and scope of the drug ring, which has caused significant harm to the city's residents and communities.
