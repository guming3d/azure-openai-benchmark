Police say Whitney infiltrated the place with a baby carrier holding a doll and a diaper bag. The Merced Sun-Star reported that a nurse called security on the couple, and both the woman and the man - who was waiting downstairs for her - were escorted out of the hospital.

chatgpt: Merced woman Tonya Whitney was arrested by police at Mercy Medical Center last week after she was found carrying dolls on two separate occasions. Whitney, who claims to have been trying to sell the dolls as a training tool to the hospital staff, was charged with disorderly conduct and trespassing. According to the police report, hospital staff had raised concerns about Whitney's behavior after she was seen carrying the dolls into the hospital. On both occasions, Whitney was accompanied by her husband, who has not been identified by police, but has not been charged. Hospital officials say they were not interested in purchasing the dolls and were concerned about Whitney's intent in bringing them onto the hospital grounds. Whitney, however, denies any malice and says she was only trying to sell them as a tool for training hospital staff. "I just wanted to help out the staff and give them a tool they could use to train," Whitney said in a statement to the media. "I didn't mean to cause any trouble, and I certainly didn't think I was doing anything wrong." Despite her claims, Whitney was arrested and spent the night in jail, but was later released on bail. Her case is pending further investigation, and Whitney may face additional charges. A spokesperson for the hospital says that while they do appreciate the offer, they cannot accept any unsolicited items from outside vendors, especially those who are not authorized by the hospital. "This type of behavior is not in line with the values of Mercy Medical Center, and we take these matters very seriously," the spokesperson said in a statement. "We are working with local law enforcement to ensure that anyone who attempts to sell unsolicited goods on our property is held accountable." Whitney's case has garnered national attention, with many people expressing their support for her on social media. Despite this, Whitney faces a legal battle that could have devastating consequences for her and her family.
