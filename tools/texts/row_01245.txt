The comedian, a regular host of the film awards, also raised eyebrows among audience members after apparently imitating scientist Stephen Hawking's electronically synthesised voice. Professor Hawking - who is known for his good humour as well as his fearsome intelligence - made jokes on stage while presenting an award, declaring at one point that he was 'better looking' than host Mr Fry. Fry then stunned the audience when he responded to the friendly banter from the notoriously good-humoured Hawking with a joke about his voice. After the prize-winners left the stage, he wrapped up, muttering 'that was really super' in what appeared to be an impression of Professor Hawking's electronic voice. A statement on the BBC's complaints website said: 'We received complaints from viewers unhappy with some of Stephen Fry's language while presenting the Baftas.' It went on: 'The Baftas is not a BBC event, but during our coverage of the awards ceremony we try to find a compromise between presenting the events of the night as they happened, while remaining within the expectations of the majority of the viewers at home - which saw over 5.5 million people tuning in to watch.

Critical: Another Twitter user said Mr Fry's impression was 'the most horrifically awkward thing I've ever seen' 'Attitudes to strong language vary enormously and we considered very carefully how to reflect this. 'Stephen, whose irreverence and style is extremely well-known to viewers, has presented the Baftas for several years. 'Any strong language was used after the watershed, and there was a presentation announcement at the start of the programme warning viewers that the broadcast would contain language of this nature. 'We accept that some viewers disagreed with this approach, and this feedback has been noted.'

chatgpt: Acclaimed comic and actor, Stephen Fry, has sparked controversy for his risque and explicit remarks while hosting a film award ceremony. Fry is a regular host of such events and has received widespread acclaim for his wit and humor. However, his recent remarks have caused a major stir. During the ceremony, Fry made provocative comments, telling the audience that it was "p***ing down with stars" inside the venue. The comments have been widely circulated on social media platforms and have led many to question whether Fry has gone too far this time. In addition to this, Fry also introduced Hollywood A-lister, Tom Cruise as 'Tom f***ing Cruise', shocking the audience and those watching at home. The show aired on the BBC, who confirmed that they received 293 complaints from viewers who were offended by Fry's language. Many have come forward to express their opinions on Fry's remarks, with some labeling them as inappropriate, while others have defended him. Some have said that Fry's humor has always been edgy and irreverent and that people should not take offense so easily. However, the fact remains that given Fry's stature and position as a respected host, his comments have left many feeling uncomfortable and offended. The BBC released a statement in which it apologized for any offense caused by Fry's language and stressed that it did not condone such behavior. A spokesman for Fry has stated that the actor did not mean to cause any offense and that his jokes were meant to be taken in jest. However, many critics have said that Fry's jokes were in poor taste, and that he should have been more careful about what he said while hosting a live television event. This is not the first time that Fry's humor has courted controversy. In 2016, the actor was accused of making racist comments during an episode of the television show, 'QI'. Fry later apologized for the comments, and stated that he was not racist and that his remarks were meant to be satirical. Despite his recent controversy, Fry remains a well-respected and gifted performer, known for his quick wit and razor-sharp humor. His role as a regular host of film award ceremonies has made him a popular favorite, and many fans are eagerly anticipating his next hosting gig. Ultimately, the controversy surrounding Fry's recent remarks highlights the need for greater sensitivity and awareness in public speech. While humor and satire can be a powerful tool for commentary and critique, it is important to use such tools with care and consideration, making sure not to cross the line into offensive or inappropriate language.
