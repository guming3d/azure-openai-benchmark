article: (CNN) -- It may as well be the 11th Commandment: Leave nature as you found it, the National Park Service says. So imagine the horror of a little girl named Eve -- no, Evie, to be exact -- when she violated the Eden that is Yosemite National Park. Her sin: She took home two sticks. Park Ranger Matt Holly learned of this transgression during a routine day opening hundreds of letters from visitors awed by Yosemite. The handwritten note from Evie read: . "Dear Park Rangers, . "I am a Yosemite Junior Ranger. I went to Yosemite recently and accidentally brought home two sticks. I know I'm not supposed to take things from the park, so I am sending them back. Please put them in nature. "Thank you, . "Evie" Touched by her innocence, Holly taped the two sticks to her letter and temporarily hung it over his desk. It's been hanging there for almost a year, he said. "We all loved it," the public information officer told CNN this week. "It was so moving to see how small the sticks were." He contacted the family, who are park regulars, and told them of how Evie's note moved all the park rangers. They are now preparing to reunite the sticks with their home. "I think we are about ready to return them to where they belong, back in nature," Holly said. "The family comes here often, they know a lot about the park and she kind of knows where she wants them." Evie's letter is now being considered for display in Yosemite's visitor center or elsewhere, Holly said. The U.S. Department of Interior may already have its caption. On its Twitter account this week, the agency commented about the letter of apology from the junior park ranger, a title given to youths between ages 7 and 13 who complete a program while visiting a national park. It said: . "Cutest. Story. Ever." The unlikely loser of the proposed spending cuts? National parks . CNN's Amanda Watts contributed to this report.

chatgpt: In today's society, it can be easy to forget the importance of respecting nature when we visit national parks and other natural sites. However, the National Park Service is reminding us all to leave nature as we found it, with a recent story demonstrating the impact of even the smallest actions. This story is about a little girl named Evie, who recently visited Yosemite National Park with her family. While exploring the beautiful landscape, Evie couldn't resist the temptation to take home two sticks as a souvenir. Upon returning home, however, Evie felt a pang of guilt for taking these items from the park. She knew that the National Park Service encourages visitors to leave nature as they found it, and she had gone against that principle.  In a true show of character, Evie decided to take action to make things right. She wrote a letter of apology to the park rangers at Yosemite, expressing her regret for taking the sticks and promising to never do something like that again.  When the rangers received Evie's letter, they were touched by her honesty and sincerity. They decided to keep the letter and the two sticks posted on a wall in the park office for a year as a reminder to all visitors of the importance of respecting nature. This story serves as a powerful reminder of the impact of our actions when visiting natural sites like national parks. The National Park Service encourages all visitors to leave nature as they found it, taking only photographs and memories and leaving only footprints. It can be tempting to take a small souvenir like a stick or a rock, but these items are a part of the natural beauty that we are there to appreciate and protect. By following the National Park Service's guidelines, we can all work together to preserve these stunning natural locations for generations to come. So next time you visit a national park or other natural site, remember Evie's story and think twice before taking home a souvenir. Leave nature as you found it, and respect the incredible landscapes that we are so lucky to have in our beautiful country.
