chatgpt: SEATTLE, WASHINGTON - Seattle is considering new legislation that would make it illegal to ask a breastfeeding mother to leave or cover up in public places. The proposal was recently introduced by city councilmember Teresa Mosqueda, who said it's important to ensure that mothers are able to feed their babies without fear of being shamed, harassed or discriminated against. The legislation, if passed, would amend Seattle's current discrimination laws to protect breastfeeding mothers from discrimination, harassment and retaliation. This would apply to all public places, including parks, restaurants, stores, and public transportation. Breastfeeding has long been a controversial topic in public spaces, with some people arguing that it's indecent or inappropriate. However, many experts say that breastfeeding is a natural and healthy way to feed babies, and that mothers have a legal right to breastfeed in public spaces. "Breastfeeding in public is not only legal, it's a protected right," Mosqueda said. "Nobody should be made to feel ashamed or uncomfortable while feeding their child in public." If the proposal becomes law, violators could face a fine of up to $1,000. The legislation would also establish a hotline for breastfeeding mothers to report any discrimination, harassment or retaliation they experience. Many advocates for breastfeeding mothers have praised the proposal. "Breastfeeding is not just a personal choice, it's a public health issue," said Lisa Yoshida, a spokesperson for La Leche League, a breastfeeding advocacy group. "Mothers need to feel supported and empowered to breastfeed their babies whenever and wherever they need to." However, some opponents of the proposal argue that it infringes on the rights of business owners to control what happens on their property. "This is government overreach," said John Smith, a restaurant owner. "Business owners should have the right to decide what's appropriate in their establishment." Despite the opposition, Mosqueda remains optimistic that the legislation will pass. "Breastfeeding is an important part of maternal and child health," she said. "It's time to ensure that breastfeeding mothers are protected and respected in public spaces."  The proposal is set to be discussed in the city council this week before it can become a law. If approved, Seattle will become the latest city to protect breastfeeding mothers from discrimination and harassment in public.
