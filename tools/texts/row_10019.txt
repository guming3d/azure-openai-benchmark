Humanitarian: Abdul-Rahman Kassig, the 26-year-old former Army Ranger, was remembered for his commitment to aid work at Butler University . 'We're because of how he lived. We're here because of the type of man he chose to be. We're here because of his selflessness.' Kassig landed in the hands of ISIS extremists last year while delivering aid to Syrians caught in the crossfire of a ghastly civil war. At the time he was working as part of Special Emergency Response and Assistance, or SERA, a relief organization he founded in 2012 and which suspended operations after his kidnapping. His parents learned of his capture last year, though the information was not made public at the time. When Kassig appeared in a beheading video of a British aid worker, his parents recorded a video pleading for his release to ISIS militants. Kassig, who converted to Islam and changed his name from Peter during his time in captivity, inspired the Muslim community to come to his family's side. Memorial: After speeches by politicians and members of the Muslim community, photos remember Kassig's life were shown . Comfort: At funeral services held Friday, friends spoke to Paula, Kassig's mother, who had pleaded with ISIS extremists for the release of her son . The Indianapolis Star reports that at a funeral service Friday, Muslim leaders denounced ISIS violence, citing the Quran's prohibition of Muslims killing other Muslims. 'The question is, is this Islam? Definitely not. Does this group belong to Islam? No, it does not. Islam is a religion of love, mercy and peace,' said Syrian Imam Shaykh Muhammad Al-Yaqoubi. 'Encouraging killing is not Islamic,' added Imam Al-Yaqoubi. At Clowes Hall at Butler on Sunday, public figures who hadn't known Kassig got up to speak about his legacy. 'It's the spirit of believing things can get better. That together we can make a difference,' said Indiana senator Joe Donnelly about Kassig's commitment to humanitarian work. 'He was an extraordinary in every way.'

chatgpt: Butler University held a service on Sunday to remember the humanitarian legacy of Abdul-Rahman Kassig, a former Army Ranger who was beheaded by ISIS extremists last month. Kassig, only 26 years old, was kidnapped while delivering humanitarian aid in eastern Syria in 2013. The service was held to honor Kassig's compassion and commitment to helping others. Speakers at the event described Kassig as an individual who went above and beyond to make a difference in the world. Kassig's humanitarian work began in 2012 when he started a nonprofit organization known as Special Emergency Response and Assistance (SERA). SERA was aimed at providing medical aid and supplies to Syrian refugees who had been displaced by the country's civil war. It was on one of these trips to Syria that Kassig was taken captive by ISIS militants. Despite his captivity, he continued to serve others, with reports stating that he helped care for fellow hostages and even attempted to negotiate their release. Kassig's family members, who attended the service, said that he was a devout Muslim who believed in helping those in need, regardless of their religious beliefs. They added that he had a deep respect for the people of Syria, which is why he chose to risk his life to help them. Kassig's tragic death has left a lasting impact on those who knew him and his work. The speakers at the service encouraged attendees to carry on Kassig's compassion and dedication to helping others. One of the speakers, Brenda Vance, a retired Army colonel who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, said, "Abdul-Rahman Kassig showed us that there is always something we can do to help others, even in the darkest of times. His legacy will continue to live on through those of us who are inspired by his selflessness." Another speaker, Rachel Appoh, a Ghanaian legislator and human rights activist, spoke about the need for people around the world to come together to fight against terrorism and hate. "Abdul-Rahman Kassig's death was a tragic loss for all of us who believe in the power of good over evil," she said. "But it also serves as a reminder that we must continue to stand together and fight against those who seek to tear us apart." The service ended with a moment of silence for Kassig and all those who have lost their lives while serving others. Attendees were encouraged to continue Kassig's humanitarian work by donating to the SERA organization that he founded. Kassig may have been taken from us too soon, but his legacy of kindness, compassion, and helping those in need will continue to inspire people around the world for years to come.
