Henry Cornish, 11, winner of the open savoury junior category at the World Pasty Championships in Cornwall . What's in a name? Quite a lot, it turns out â€“ at least when it comes to pasty making. Two brothers named Cornish have followed in their father's footsteps and triumphed at the World Pasty Championships. Henry Cornish, 14, won the open savoury junior category at the second annual event, held at the Eden Project in Cornwall. And his 11-year-old brother, Simon, came second in the Cornish pasty junior category. Their father Graham was crowned the winner in both the Cornish pasty and open savoury professional categories last year. Henry, of Launceston, Cornwall, said: 'I'm a bit surprised to be honest, I wasn't really expecting it because I entered just for fun but I'm really happy. 'My dad winning last year opened up my eyes so I thought that I would have a go this year. 'I did a pizza pasty because I absolutely love pizza so I thought why don't I try and make it into a pasty.' More than 125 professional and amateur bakers competed on Saturday and the winners across eight categories were announced at a ceremony dubbed the 'Oggy Oscars'. Defending champion Billy Deakin, from Mount Hawke, Cornwall, regained the champion spot in the Cornish pasty amateur category.

He said: 'It feels great to win, last year it was a bit of a surprise but this year I really wanted to win. 'I made the same pasty I always make at home and the judges obviously liked it as much as I do.' The championships also included pasty making workshops and demonstrations, with pop singer and cookery writer Paul Young among the special guests. Cornwall-born Mike Amery, who had flown from Pennsylvania, U.S., for the competition was presented with a special pasty ambassador award. Last year, Cornish pasties were given Protected Geographical Indication status by the European Commission. Savouring the moment: The world championship winners at the Eden Project, near St Austell . The status means only pasties made within the county are allowed to be labelled 'Cornish Pasty'. It followed a nine-year campaign by trade organisation, Cornish Pasty Association, which is made up of more than 50 pasty makers in Cornwall. Members of the association are estimated as being responsible for around six per cent of the area's food economy. Although its origins remain unclear, the pasty is first thought to have become popular in Cornwall in the 17th Century, with tin miners finding the food easy to carry and reheat, and eat without cutlery.

chatgpt: In the world of Cornwall's annual baking competition, the Cornish family is a force to be reckoned with. This year's event, which took place last weekend, saw 14-year-old Henry Cornish take top honors in the open savoury junior category. Simon Cornish, 11, didn't disappoint either, taking second place in the pasty junior class.  The Cornish family has been a staple of the baking competition for years, with father Graham Cornish taking home two prizes at last year's event. It's clear that baking talent runs deep in the Cornish family, and their continued success has made them a beloved presence at the annual competition. Henry Cornish, who has been learning the art of baking from his father since he was old enough to reach the counter, put his skills to the test with his award-winning savoury dish. His creation, which featured fresh herbs and locally-sourced ingredients, wowed the judges with its complex flavors and perfect execution. "It's amazing to see how far Henry has come in just a few short years," said Graham Cornish, proud father and mentor to both Henry and Simon. "He's always had a natural talent for baking, but it took a lot of hard work and practice to get to this level." Simon Cornish, who also learned to bake from his father, may have come in second in his category, but he still had plenty to be proud of. His pasty, which featured a unique twist on a classic recipe, was a crowd favorite and received high praise from the competition judges. "I'm so proud of both of my boys," said Graham Cornish. "To see them both do so well in such a competitive environment is truly rewarding." For the Cornish family, the annual baking competition isn't just about winning prizes. It's also an opportunity to showcase their love of baking and their dedication to using locally-sourced ingredients whenever possible. The family's commitment to sustainable, eco-friendly baking practices has made them a beloved fixture in the Cornwall community. "We believe that baking should be about more than just creating tasty treats," said Graham Cornish. "It should also be about supporting local farmers and businesses, and doing our part to protect the environment. That's something that's very important to our family." As for next year's competition, the Cornish family has already begun planning their entries. With two talented young bakers in the family, there's no doubt that they'll continue to be a force to be reckoned with in Cornwall's annual baking competition for years to come.
