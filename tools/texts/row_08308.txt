article: (CNN) -- A West Nile virus epidemic has prompted a public health emergency in Dallas County, Texas, where the disease has killed nine people, a judge declared Friday. The virus there infected 175 people, said Patricia Huston of Dallas County Health and Human Services. Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins declared the emergency in his capacity as director of the county's Homeland Security and Emergency Management and instructed the department to file a local disaster declaration with the state. "This declaration will expand our avenues for assistance in our ongoing battle with West Nile virus," Jenkins said in a statement. West Nile virus on the rise in the U.S. Insecticide spraying by planes will be offered to certain communities hit hard by the virus as long as those local governments request it, Jenkins told reporters. The aerial spraying would occur from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., when children are inside, Jenkins said. "The insecticide is safe," Jenkins said. "The planes are quite sophisticated, and they get the spray to where it needs to go." The judge organized an invitation-only work session Friday with county, state and federal officials to discuss a response to the epidemic. The United States is experiencing its biggest spike in West Nile virus since 2004, with 241 cases of the disease reported nationwide this year so far, including four deaths, health officials said last weekend, before the latest totals. Of the 42 states that have reported infections in people, birds or mosquitoes, 80% of them have been in Texas, Mississippi and Oklahoma, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement. The CDC listed a breakdown of infections by state. "It is not clear why we are seeing more activity than in recent years," said Marc Fischer, a CDC medical epidemiologist. "Regardless of the reasons for the increase, people should be aware of the West Nile virus activity in their area and take action to protect themselves and their family." The virus is transmitted through infected mosquitoes. In the United States, most infections occur between June and September, and peak in August, according to the CDC. Symptoms include fever, headache, body aches, joint pains, vomiting, diarrhea or rash. "Less than 1% develop a serious neurologic illness such as encephalitis or meningitis (inflammation of the brain or surrounding tissues)," the CDC said. Those at greater risk are people older than 50 and those with conditions such as cancer, diabetes and kidney disease, or with organ transplants. There are no medications to treat West Nile virus or vaccines to prevent infection. People with milder illnesses typically recover on their own, but those more seriously affected may need hospital care. Health experts say prevention measures include avoiding mosquito bites, using insect repellant and getting rid of insect breeding sites. Symptoms of West Nile virus .

chatgpt: The West Nile virus outbreak in Dallas County, Texas has become a matter of grave concern for local authorities as the number of deaths and infections continues to rise. As of now, the virus has claimed nine lives and infected 175 people. In response to the growing crisis, officials have announced that they will offer aerial insecticide spraying to affected communities.  This move comes after Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins declared a public health emergency due to the virus, which has been spreading rapidly since the beginning of the summer. The county is currently experiencing its biggest spike in West Nile virus cases since 2004, with the number of infected individuals surpassing the figures from previous years. The decision to offer aerial insecticide spraying has been made following consultations with experts and health officials. The insecticide is aimed at controlling the population of mosquitoes that carry the virus. However, it will not be used indiscriminately but only in areas where there is a high concentration of mosquitoes, and it will be carried out under controlled conditions. "We are taking this step because we believe that it is the most effective way to combat the spread of the West Nile virus," said Judge Jenkins in a statement. "We understand that there may be concerns about the use of insecticides, but we want to reassure the public that we are taking all necessary precautions to ensure their safety and wellbeing." The spraying will be carried out by Mosquito Control Services, which has been contracted by the county authorities. The company will use a low-flying aircraft to spray insecticide over the affected areas. It is expected that the spraying will take place over several evenings in the coming weeks. The decision to spray insecticide has been controversial, with some residents and environmental groups voicing their concerns. They argue that aerial spraying could have harmful effects on the local ecosystem and that there may be long-term health risks associated with the use of insecticides. However, health officials have reassured the public that the insecticide is safe and that all necessary precautions will be taken to minimize any potential risks. In the meantime, residents of Dallas County are being urged to take precautions to protect themselves from the virus. They are advised to wear long-sleeved shirts and pants, use insect repellent containing DEET, and avoid going outdoors during dawn and dusk when mosquitoes are most active. The West Nile virus outbreak in Dallas County is a reminder of the importance of effective public health measures to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. The use of aerial insecticide spraying is one such measure, and officials hope that it will help to bring the outbreak under control. However, the ultimate goal is to eradicate the virus altogether, and that will require a concerted effort from authorities and the public alike.
