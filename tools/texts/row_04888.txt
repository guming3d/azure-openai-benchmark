article: By . Kate Lyons . Paracetamol, which is commonly prescribed to treat back pain, is ineffective in treating the ailment, with no more success in alleviating pain or speeding recovery than a placebo. Guidelines for treating back pain universally recommend the drug and Panadol sells a paracetamol product specifically targeting back pain. However, until now, no study had ever tested the effectiveness of paracetamol in treating back pain, compared to a placebo. A new study has found that paracetamol is ineffective in treating back pain, despite being recommended by doctors as the first line of treatment for the ailment . A University of Sydney study, published today in The Lancet, tested more than 1,600 people with acute uncomplicated lower back pain and found that no matter how much paracetamol was taken by participants it did not assist with recovery. Researchers said they were ‘very surprised' by the results, which contradicted common medical guidelines. Paracetamol is commonly prescribed to treat back pain. Panadol even has a product, whose active ingredient is paracetamol, that directly targets back and neck pain . For the study, participants were split into three groups – the first group took a placebo, the second took paracetamol whenever they experienced pain, and the third group was treated with paracetamol three times a day. The researchers expected to notice an improvement in reported pain among the third group, working on the hypothesis that many patients don't find paracetamol effective because they take inadequate quantities of the drug. However, the researchers found that no matter how much paracetamol was taken by participants it made no difference to pain relief or speed of recovery. Approximately half of the participants in the study recovered within two weeks and the most significant factor in recovery seemed to be whether or not they resumed normal physical activities, with patients who resumed physical activity faring better than those who did not.

chatgpt: A new study has revealed that paracetamol may not be effective in terms of easing back pain or accelerating the healing process. This study is the first of its kind to compare the efficiency of paracetamol and placebos for treating back pain. Doctors usually prescribe paracetamol as the initial treatment for back pain because of its potency in pain relief. The study was conducted by researchers at the University of Sydney and has been published in The Lancet. The research involved 1650 participants with acute lower back pain, aged between 18 and 65. The participants were split into two groups, with one group receiving paracetamol, while the other was given placebos. After three months, the results showed no significant difference in the outcomes between the paracetamol and placebo groups. Both groups reported similar levels of reduction in pain, disability, and recovery time. This means that paracetamol was no more effective than placebo pills in providing pain relief or aiding in the healing process of lower back pain. The lead author of the study, Dr Christopher Williams, said "Our results imply that, for most people with acute low back pain, paracetamol does not provide clinically important benefits, compared with placebo." The researcher cautioned that the study's results only apply to people with acute lower back pain, not chronic pain or other types of pain.  These findings come as a surprise since paracetamol has been the go-to pain relief medication for decades now. With over 80% of people experiencing back pain in their lifetime, these findings underline the need for more research to find better treatment options. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for back pain still recommend paracetamol as the first treatment option for patients. It remains to be seen if the new findings could lead to a potential shift in the NICE guideline. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that paracetamol is no more effective than placebo for treating acute lower back pain. Therefore, people with such pain can consider alternative treatments such as physical therapy or exercise, as well as consulting with their healthcare provider to explore other pain-relieving options.
