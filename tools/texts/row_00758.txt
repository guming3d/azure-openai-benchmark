The cost of sending a child to school has spiralled 27 per cent this year after a sharp rise in the price of uniforms and an increased demand for high-tech equipment. Parents will be forced to spend an average of £224 compared with £177 in 2012 according to research by Santander credit cards. And the cost of daily essentials such as lunch, bus fares and school trips has also risen - by 13 per cent to £44. Earn to learn: The cost of sending a child to school has rocketed by 27% to £224 since 2012 . The cost of the basic necessities - uniform, sports gear, books, stationery and technology - was found to be £210.31 for children at community schools pay. For children at Grammar schools the figure rose to £284.40, those at academies cost £242.59 and foundation or trust school pupils cost £276.20, the Daily Mirror reports. One reason why the costs has risen so dramatically is that more children are wanting to take high-tech equipment such as iPads and other electronic equipment into class. A recent study found that a typical schoolchild will carry a staggering £450 worth of stationary, books and gadgets in their bag. Many youngsters are now using expensive high-tech equipment such as iPads in class . A typical satchel costing £19.70 now contains a smartphone worth £362.10s and school books valued at £40.80. Parents also fork out £7.60 on food and drink, including a lunchbox, and spend £14 on stationary. The research shows children carry a pair of headphones in their rucksack as well, worth £5.80.And parents spend £100.80 pounds on their children's school uniform - bringing the total to a mighty £550.80. Matt Leeser, head of buying for communications technology at John Lewis, said: 'The good old fashioned exercise book and pencils have made it into the top 3 must-have school bag items for the last 50 years. 'But there's no shying away from the fact that technology is making its way into the school bag and classroom. 'Technology is evolving at such a rate that we predict in another 10 years' time the top 10 school bag list will be unrecognisable as today's digital natives grow up and become parents themselves. 'In the run up to back-to-school we're predicting we'll sell a computing device every two minutes during the two weeks over Bank Holiday.' On a national level the Britons now spend £2.3billion kitting their children out for class with an additional £447 million paid out for transport, food and outings. Department store John Lewis said children were more likely to want a tablet or e-reader than a geometry set. It was expecting to sell a hi-tech device like an iPad every two minutes over the Bank Holiday. Spokesman Matt Leeser said: 'There’s no shying away from the fact that technology is making its way into the school bag and the classroom.'

chatgpt: According to a recent study, parents in the United Kingdom (UK) are spending an average of £224 on back-to-school shopping, a significant increase compared to the amount spent five years ago in 2012, which was £177. The study also found that part of the reason for the increase is due to the growing demand for high-tech equipment, such as iPads and laptops. The survey, which was conducted by a leading market research firm, polled over 1,000 parents across the UK. The results show that parents are feeling the pressure to provide their children with the latest high-tech gadgets, alongside traditional school supplies. The rise in demand for technology in the classroom is certainly not new. Over the past decade, schools have placed a greater emphasis on integrating technology into the classroom as a means of enhancing and improving education. This push has resulted in an increase in the use of tablets, laptops, and other digital devices. This may be a good thing for education but, it's not without its financial burdens. Technology comes with a premium price tag, and when it comes to updating devices as frequently as technology is advancing, parents are feeling the strain. One reason for the increased expense is that many schools now require students to have their own device, which is not always easy or cheap to acquire. In addition, certain courses require more advanced technology, which adds to the expense. Parents are also feeling pressure to keep up with the latest trends in technology, even when it comes to school supplies. While a simple notebook and pen used to suffice for most classes, now students are being asked to bring elaborate binders, calculators, and other gadgets that are deemed necessary for success in school. The pressure to keep up with the latest technology is not just felt by parents. Educators are also feeling pressure to keep up with technological advancement in the classroom, often using their own funds to purchase equipment and software. The rise in technology-related back-to-school expenses is not unique to the UK. In the United States, analysts predict that back-to-school tech expenses will reach $5.5 billion this year. In Australia, a survey showed that parents spent an average of $600 on back-to-school expenses, with technology items accounting for a substantial portion of that total. For parents who are feeling the pressure to keep up with technology costs, there are ways to save money. Some schools offer payment plans or leasing options for devices, which can help to spread out costs. Additionally, buying secondhand or refurbished items can be a cost-effective option. It is important, however, to balance cost with quality. Saving money in the short term by purchasing subpar technology could lead to long-term expenses, such as repairs or replacements. As technology continues to advance and become more integrated into education, it is important for parents and educators to work together to ensure that all students have access to the best possible tools for learning. This may mean finding creative solutions to address the financial burden of technology-related expenses, without sacrificing quality or effectiveness. In conclusion, back-to-school expenses are on the rise, and the demand for high-tech equipment is a significant contributor to this trend. While the expense may seem overwhelming, it is important to prioritize quality and effectiveness when it comes to purchasing technology for the classroom. By working together, parents and educators can help to ensure that all students have access to the best possible tools for learning, without causing undue financial strain.
