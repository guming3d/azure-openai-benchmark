article: Traps have been set up around a lakeside Florida suburb after a family dog was snatched by a gator and pulled into the water this week. Jessie, a 50-pound mixed-breed, had been the pet of Mark Byers for the last 10 years. Mr Byers daughter was walking their dog along the lake at the back of their Sunrise home on Tuesday when suddenly an eight-foot-long alligator came out of the water and grabbed her. 'It's an awful tragedy,' Mr Byers told Local 10 News. 'It's terrible.' Snatched: Jessie was out for a walk along the waters edge in Sunset, Florida, on Tuesday night when she was dragged into the water by a local gator . Missed: Jessie was a beloved part of the Byers family . Predator: The alligator is said to have been in the freshwater lake in Sunset for years, but had been appearing more frequently over the last couple of weeks . Dangerous: Wildlife officers in the area have urged residents to be careful when approaching the water . Dead: Jessie was pulled into the water in a matter of seconds on Tuesday and never seen again . Scene: Mr Byers said he had built a sea wall to try and keep any gators from getting into his yard . Mr Byers said the gator has been lurking in the lake for as long as he can remember. However locals say the reptile has been seen much more frequently over the last two weeks. Mr Byers built a sea wall to stop the animal getting to his dog or his family. However Jessie was playing in the water while out on the walk - something they could never train her to stop doing. That's when the gator suddenly snatched her. 'She’s just gone. Things happen in a split second,' Mr Byers told The Sun Sentinel. 'It’s just a sad situation.' Upset: Mr Byers adopted Jessie from the Humane Society 10 years ago and said she was part of the family . Walk: The dog was being walked by Mr Byers' daughter, Taylor (pictured) when the incident occurred Tuesday . Scene: The Byers' yard backs onto the freshwater lake . Officers from Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission are now setting traps along the shore. And the future does not sound good for the gator if and when it is trapped. 'My understanding is that gators generally of this size, if they have a history like this, aren't going to be placed elsewhere,' spokeswoman Liz Barraco said. Ms Barraco warned people who live in the area to be extra cautious, especially if they live around freshwater bodies. Avoid the waters edge, especially around dusk and dawn, is safest.

chatgpt: Tragedy struck Sunset on Tuesday night as a young girl, Jessie, was attacked by an alligator while playing in the water behind her house. Local wildlife officers have been quick to respond, setting traps in the hopes of capturing the dangerous predator. However, locals are being urged to exercise caution around bodies of water moving forward. The incident occurred on what was supposed to be a quiet evening in the small lake community. Jessie was playing in the water behind her house, enjoying the warm summer weather, when the alligator suddenly appeared and attacked her. Neighbors reported hearing screams coming from the water and quickly called 911. Officers with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission were on the scene within minutes, searching the area in the hopes of locating the alligator responsible for the attack. Several traps were set in the water, but as of yet, the reptile has not been located. Speaking on the incident, Lieutenant Tim Ivey emphasized the dangers of living near bodies of water that are home to alligators. "This is an unfortunate reminder that these animals can pose a real threat to humans, especially children who may not know how to properly avoid them," he stated. It is reported that Jessie's family has declined to comment on the incident at this time, understandably shaken by the traumatic event. Locals in the Sunset community are understandably on edge in the aftermath of the attack, with many concerned about the potential dangers lurking in the nearby waterways. In response, local authorities have issued a warning urging residents to be cautious when spending time near or in water, particularly around dawn and dusk when alligators are most active. According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, alligators are quite common in Florida waterways, particularly during the warmer summer months. As such, those who live near or frequent bodies of water should take precautions in order to reduce the risk of conflict. Some tips offered by the commission include staying out of the water during dusk and dawn, avoiding areas where alligators have been spotted, not feeding them, keeping pets on a leash while near water, and being cautious when landscaping near bodies of water. While the incident involving Jessie is undoubtedly tragic, it serves as a reminder of the importance of respecting the wildlife and natural environments that surround us. By taking the necessary precautions, residents can hopefully avoid future conflicts with these powerful predators and enjoy Florida's beautiful waterways safely.
