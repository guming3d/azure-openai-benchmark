article: (CNN) -- Bayern Munich have confirmed that Turkish international Hamit Altintop is one of three players who will leave the club after Saturday's final Bundesliga match of the season against Stuttgart. Former Schalke midfielder Altintop, defensive midfielder Andreas Ottl and reserve goalkeeper Thomas Kraft are the trio who will be moving on during the close season, with the club marking their farewell with a bouquet of flowers after the game. Altintop, 28, joined Bayern in 2007 and was a member of the domestic double winning sides of 2008 and 2010, also featuring in the 2010 Champions League final defeat by Inter Milan. However, his time at the club was restricted by injuries, restricting him to just 63 Bundesliga appearances in four seasons. "This season, Hamit only played three games from the start. He feels that's not enough, and we understand and respect his decision," Bayern chairman Karl- Heinz Rummenigge told the club's official website. It is unclear where Altintop will play his football next season, although there have been reports linking Real Madrid with a move for the player. Meanwhile, Ottl leaves Bayern after joining the club in 1996 aged just 11. The 26-year-old never fully established himself in the senior side, making 91 appearances and scoring five goals during his time with the Bavarian giants. A valuable squad member, Ottl has won three Bundesliga titles and three German Cups during his time with Bayern. Meanwhile, Kraft has decided to leave Bayern in search of regular first team football, and has agreed a deal to join Bundesliga newcomers Hertha Berlin for next season. Director of sport Christian Nerlinger said of the 21-year-old: "I can understand that Thomas Kraft's aim is to be a first-choice goalkeeper, but we could not give him that guarantee."

chatgpt: Bayern Munich announced on Friday that Hamit Altintop is one of the three players who will leave the club after Saturday's match against Stuttgart. The other two players are midfielders Andreas Ottl and goalkeeper Thomas Kraft. Altintop was a midfield maestro for Bayern Munich, appearing in more than 100 games and scoring 15 goals for the team. He was also a member of the Turkish national team, making 83 appearances and scoring 8 goals. The departure of Altintop, Ottl, and Kraft signals the end of an era for Bayern Munich. The trio has played a vital role in the team's success over the years, but their contracts are set to expire at the end of the season, making them free agents. While Altintop has yet to announce his next move, Kraft has already signed a contract to join Bundesliga newcomers Hertha Berlin. The 22-year-old goalkeeper is seen as a promising young talent, and his move to Hertha will give him the opportunity to develop his skills further. Meanwhile, Ottl's future remains uncertain as the 27-year-old midfielder has yet to sign with any club. Ottl joined Bayern Munich's youth academy at the age of 13 and progressed through the ranks to become a regular first-team player. He made 34 appearances for the team and scored two goals. Bayern Munich's coach, Jupp Heynckes, thanked Altintop, Ottl, and Kraft for their contributions to the team and wished them good luck in their future endeavors. Heynckes added that the club is already planning to bring in new players to reinforce the squad for the upcoming season. The departure of Altintop, Ottl, and Kraft is a significant loss for Bayern Munich. However, the team's management is already looking ahead to the future and planning to bring in new talent to ensure that the team remains competitive in the Bundesliga and beyond.
