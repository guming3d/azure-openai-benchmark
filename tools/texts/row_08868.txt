article: This is the photo taken seconds before a safari tourist was seriously injured by a rhino - after she was allegedly urged to stand closer to the animal by a wildlife expert. Chantal Beyer, 24, was visiting the South African nature park with her boyfriend when they stopped to look at some rhinos. Afrikaans-language newspaper the Beeld reported that guide Alex Richter then advised them to stand a little closer seconds before the animal gored her from behind. Attack: Chantal Beyer, 24, pictured standing next to a rhino seconds before she was gored at a wildlife safari park in South Africa . He allegedly told a group of visitors to get out of their vehicle to take photos and even encouraged the rhinos to come closer with food. The photograph shows them only feet away from two white rhinos which can weigh up to two tons and stand as tall as 1.8metres. Just after the picture was taken, a huge bull rhino attacked, and its horn penetrated Ms Beyers' chest from behind, resulting in a collapsed lung and broken ribs. Injuries: Ms Beyer is understood to be in the intensive care unit at Krugersdorp hospital after being gored by the rhino . Ms Beyer, a bachelor of commerce student from Johannesburg, is now in an intensive care unit at a Krugersdorp hospital where she is said to be in stable condition, according to the Daily Telegraph. Mrs Beyer's uncle and family spokesman Thom Peeters told the Beeld: 'There were quite a few young people on the vehicle and they probably felt they could trust Richter, who was an adult.' South Africa's Aloe Ridge Hotel and Nature Reserve, where the incident took place, declined to comment today. On the resort's website it lists rhinos as one of a number of animals which visitors can see 'at close range'.

chatgpt: A 24-year-old woman, Chantal Beyer, was attacked by a bull rhino while on safari in South Africa. The incident occurred after the young woman exited her vehicle to take a photo with the rhino, at the urging of their guide. Within seconds of the photo being snapped, the rhino charged, leaving her seriously injured with a collapsed lung and broken ribs. The tragedy highlights the growing problem of dangerous interactions between humans and wildlife during safari tours. While the wildlife is often the main attraction, visitors must remember that these animals are wild and can be unpredictable. According to reports, the safari guide encouraged visitors to get closer to the rhino for a better photo opportunity, despite the clear danger such proximity presented. This reckless decision-making is highly irresponsible and put the lives of visitors in jeopardy. Ms Beyer's experience serves as a warning not only for the importance of responsible conduct on safaris but for the need for greater regulation of such tours. Furthermore, it underlines the need for clearance and caution when taking photos. The incident will no doubt have a profound effect on the young woman, whose road to recovery will likely be a long one. But it should also prompt African governments to take more stringent measures to protect not just their natural heritage but also the people who come to enjoy it. This can be achieved through better training for safari guides, as well as stricter enforcement of existing rules governing wildlife interaction. It is essential that both tour operators and their guests act responsibly, ensuring that future safari trips do not end in tragedy. In conclusion, the attack on Chantal Beyer shows the need for heightened vigilance in wildlife interaction during safaris. It serves as a warning for both visitors and operators to implement the regulations that can prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.
