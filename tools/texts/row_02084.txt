chatgpt: Relatives of Rhoda Callwood, a 68-year-old grandmother from St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, were left stunned and horrified after discovering that her organs were delivered separately from her body to the funeral home where she was being prepared for a viewing. The organs were reportedly delivered in plastic containers, a fact that has raised questions and concerns about the handling and treatment of Callwood's remains. The shocking discovery was made by Callwood's family members during the viewing, and has left them traumatized and seeking answers. The family has hired an attorney to represent them, and is demanding a full investigation into the circumstances surrounding the dismemberment of Callwood's body. According to reports, Callwood passed away on January 2nd, 2021, after a battle with pneumonia. Her body was taken to the Juan F. Luis Hospital and Medical Center, where an autopsy was performed. It is unclear why her organs were removed, although it is standard practice in some cases. However, the family claims that they were not informed that the organs would be removed, and did not give permission for such a procedure to be carried out. The family only discovered that Callwood's organs were missing when they arrived at the funeral home to view her body. They were told by staff at the funeral home that the organs had been delivered separately, in plastic containers. The family is now demanding to know why the organs were removed, where they were taken, and how they were handled and transported. The situation has caused the family immense emotional distress, and they are now struggling to come to terms with the fact that Callwood's body was not treated with the respect and dignity it deserved. They have expressed outrage at the apparent lack of communication and transparency surrounding the autopsy and organ removal process. The family's attorney, Jerome Lee, has called for a full investigation into the matter, and has vowed to fight for justice on behalf of the family. Lee has stated that the family is seeking answers to several key questions, including why the organs were removed, whether the family gave their consent for the removal, and how the organs were stored and transported. Lee has also urged the relevant authorities to take swift action to ensure that such a situation does not occur again in the future. He has stated that families have a right to be fully informed about any procedures carried out on their loved ones, and that the lack of communication and transparency in this case is unacceptable. The situation has prompted widespread outrage and calls for accountability, with many people expressing their shock and disbelief at the treatment of Callwood's remains. The family is currently preparing to lay Callwood to rest, but the circumstances surrounding her death and the handling of her remains have cast a dark shadow over what should have been a time of mourning and reflection. The family is calling for justice and accountability, and is hopeful that their efforts will lead to a better understanding of what happened to Callwood's body, and a renewed commitment to transparency and communication in future cases. For now, however, they are left struggling to come to terms with the shocking discovery that has left them reeling and traumatized.
