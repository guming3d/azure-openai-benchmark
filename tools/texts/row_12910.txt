The Blue Planet Aquarium in Cheshire is celebrating a tiny triumph after successfully breeding one of the world's smallest species of fish. The tiny Danionella translucida, from Burma, is just 10mm long when fully grown, and its tiny babies are only 2mm long and almost invisible to the naked eye. The creatures is also transparent, allowing to see the fish's internal organs. The tiny Danionella translucida from Burma (pictured) is just 10mm long when fully grown, and its tiny babies are so small they are almost invisible to the naked eye . The fish are found in Southern Myanmar in small shallow muddy streams. One recorded habitat is known as Bala Stream. Here the water has a pH of 7.2 and is medium-hard. They are found with various barbs and rasboras, and are highly likely to be at the bottom of the food chain due to its size. The maximum recorded is 12mm. Males are larger than females. Eggs are reported to be 0.5mm in diameter (relatively large for the size of fish), and only a few are laid at any one time. Their estimated lifespan is 2-3 years, but accurate data is still lacking on this. Staff at the aquarium were amazed when they noticed the tiny babies swimming with their parents in the display tank. Steve Chester, our Freshwater Aquarist, told MailOnline: ‘I am delighted to have the chance to work with this very rare fish. 'Little is known on the natural breeding cycle and as a team we are working hard to increase our knowledge on the life cycle and breeding habits of this fish, with a view to sharing our findings with other public aquariums and researchers.’ Mr Chester added: 'Their size and the . fact that in the wild they live in a small area makes them particularly . vulnerable to environmental change.'

Found in Southern Myanmar in small shallow muddy streams, the tiny Danionella translucida eggs are reported to be 0.5mm in diameter. Only a few are laid at any one time and the fish's estimated lifespan is two to three years. 'Due to their scarcity, little is known about their breeding habits,' said Dave Wolfenden, curator at the Blue Planet Aquariam. 'Bolton Museum has been assisting with our breeding programme, and we are continuing to record breeding habits to increase knowledge on the species.'

chatgpt: Blue Planet Aquarium, located in Cheshire, has made an incredible breakthrough in marine biology by successfully breeding Danionella translucida. These tiny creatures, known for their transparent nature, have been a source of fascination for scientists and visitors alike. Not only are the Danionella translucida strikingly beautiful to observe, with their see-through bodies and visible internal organs, but they also serve as an important indicator species for water quality. The aquarium's success in breeding these creatures marks a significant achievement in conservation efforts, as the species has had a relatively low survival rate in captivity. The breeding process was a painstaking one, with the team at Blue Planet Aquarium carefully monitoring water conditions and observing the mating behavior of the Danionella translucida. When the eggs finally hatched, the tiny babies were only two millimeters long, making them almost invisible to the naked eye. The team at Blue Planet Aquarium say that the successful breeding of these creatures has been a long-term goal, one that required careful planning and conditioning of the parent fish. By recreating the natural habitat of the Danionella translucida, the aquarium was able to create the optimal environment for breeding, resulting in a healthy and thriving population. "We are thrilled with this success and our team has worked incredibly hard over the past few years to get to this point," said Jamie Christon, Managing Director of Blue Planet Aquarium. "Breeding these stunning creatures is not only important for conservation efforts, but it also helps us to better understand the complex ecosystem of our oceans." Danionella translucida are found in rice paddies in Southeast Asia and are known for their extreme sensitivity to changes in water quality. In the wild, they are under threat from habitat destruction and pollution, making successful breeding in captivity crucial for the species' survival. The transparent nature of the Danionella translucida has also captured the attention of researchers and visitors alike. By being able to observe the creatures' internal organs, scientists are better able to understand how their biology functions, which could have important implications for medical research. Blue Planet Aquarium is one of the UK's leading marine attractions, with a focus on conservation and education. Their success in breeding Danionella translucida is just one example of the important work being done at the aquarium to further our understanding of the marine world. Visitors to the aquarium can now see the breeding program in action in the Danionella translucida exhibit, which showcases the tiny creatures in all their transparent beauty. The team at Blue Planet Aquarium hopes that the success of their breeding program will inspire others to join the fight for ocean conservation and the preservation of species like Danionella translucida.
