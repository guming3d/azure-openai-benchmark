article: The Chicago Crime Commission named a new Public Enemy No. 1 on Thursday, a designation originally crafted for Al Capone. The new holder of this dubious distinction, however, is not American nor believed to be in the United States. He is Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, the infamous Mexican drug lord who is Chicago's most wanted because his Sinaloa cartel supplies a majority of the narcotics in the city. Not since Capone "has any criminal deserved this title more than Joaquin Guzman," commission President J.R. Davis said in a news release. "Guzman is the major supplier of narcotics to Chicago. His agents are working in the Chicago area importing vast quantities of drugs for sale throughout the Chicago region and collecting and sending to Mexico tens of millions of dollars in drug money." Daughter of accused drug lord deported to Mexico . Guzman is the boss of the Sinaloa cartel, one of Mexico's most powerful drug trafficking operations. His nickname, which means "shorty," matches his 5-foot-6-inch frame, though he has climbed to great heights in the drug smuggling business. Forbes magazine has estimated that "El Chapo" is worth $1 billion. The U.S. Treasury Department has declared him the most influential trafficker in the world, and Mexican authorities have been on his tail since his 2001 escape from a Mexican prison in a laundry cart. Chicago is among the major destinations for the cartel's illegal drugs. "While Chicago is 1,500 miles from Mexico, the Sinaloa drug cartel is so deeply embedded in the city that local and federal law enforcement are forced to operate as if they are on the border," said Jack Riley, who heads the Drug Enforcement Administration's office in the city. The DEA is heading up a new strike force focusing on what Riley calls "choke points": where the drugs and money change hands between the cartel operatives and Chicago gangs. Language and cultural barriers at that juncture make the criminal groups more vulnerable, he said in a statement. Officials hope this strategy weakens the cartel and creates leads that may bring the capture of Guzman, who is in hiding in Mexico. "If I pitted Chicago's traditional organized crime group against Guzman and the Sinaloa Cartel, it wouldn't be a fight," Riley said. "In my opinion, Guzman is the new Al Capone of Chicago. His ability to corrupt and enforce his sanctions with his endless supply of revenue is more powerful than Chicago's Italian organized crime gang."

chatgpt: The Chicago Crime Commission has named a new Public Enemy No. 1 and it's none other than Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, the notorious Mexican drug lord. Despite being in hiding in Mexico, Guzman has been blamed for the majority of narcotics-related crimes in the city of Chicago. The Chicago Crime Commission, a non-governmental organization that regularly compiles lists of the city's most notorious mobsters, gang leaders, and drug traffickers, issued the new designation on Thursday. The organization also cited Guzman's role in the recent surge of violence and drug-related deaths in the city. Guzman, who once topped Forbes magazine's list of the world's most powerful people, has long been a prominent figure in the Mexican drug trade. He rose to infamy in 2001 after escaping from a maximum-security prison, and again in 2015 after his recapture and subsequent extradition to the United States. He is currently serving a life sentence in a U.S. prison. Despite Guzman's imprisonment, his narcotics empire has continued to flourish, with the Sinaloa cartel that he once led still operating in many parts of Mexico, Central America, and the United States. In Chicago, the Sinaloa cartel is believed to control the majority of drug trafficking activity, including the distribution of cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine. The Chicago Crime Commission's decision to name Guzman its new Public Enemy No. 1 is a clear indication of the group's concern over the continued presence and influence of his cartel in the city. The designation also serves as a warning to other drug traffickers and gang leaders that law enforcement is closely monitoring their activities. The announcement has been met with mixed reactions from Chicago law enforcement officials. Some have praised the move as a recognition of the importance of taking down major drug players like Guzman, while others have questioned the effectiveness of such lists in curbing crime. Regardless of the response, it is clear that the issue of drug trafficking and violence in Chicago is a serious one. The city has seen a steady increase in homicides in recent years, with many of the deaths connected to drug-related disputes. As such, the designation of a new Public Enemy No. 1 can serve as a symbolic call to action for law enforcement and city officials to take more aggressive steps in cracking down on the illicit drug trade.
