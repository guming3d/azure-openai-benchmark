article: At least 10 people have been injured by piranhas in the same Argentine river where a similar attack by the carnivorous fish occurred last month. The vicious creatures, known as palometas, have been attacking bathers since Thursday at the Parana River in Rosario, which is 186 miles north-east of Buenos Aires. Seventy people were bitten by the shoal of meat-eating fish in late December as they attempted to cool off from the unusually high summer temperatures. Vicious: A shoal of sharp-toothed palometas have been blamed for recent attacks on swimmers in Argentina . During that attack, a seven-year-old girl lost part of a finger, while other swimmers suffered deep cuts to their ankles, fingers and hands. Palometas have been described as 'a type of piranha, big, voracious and with sharp teeth that can really bite.' They have been known to target humans in Rosario before, with 40 swimmers hurt during a mass-attack in 2008. Media reports said the latest injuries include a boy who suffered a foot wound while floating in the river. Experts say a combination of hot weather and lower numbers of species such as caiman, which prey on the fish, could be causing the attacks. Fatalities are however rare, with the majority of attacks occurring as nips and bites to the extremities, such as hands and feet. Injured: A man is treated following the attack in December . Attack victim: This man sustained a bite on his foot following the vicious fish attack in the Parana River in December . Under attack: The Parana river in Rosario, where the fish have been attacking swimmers since December . On alert: The city of Rosario in Argentina, which has been subject to attacks by the piranha-like fish . Ready to bite: Piranhas have strong teeth and jaws . Piranhas are omnivorous freshwater fish native to South American rivers, but they have also been spotted in Bangladesh and China. They are known for their sharp teeth and a voracious appetite for meat. The exact number of piranha species is unknown, as new species continue to be discovered, but estimates range from 30 to 60. Piranhas are normally 14cm to 26cm long, though some have been reported up to 43cm in length. Attacks in the Amazon basin have been on the increase in recent years. In 2011, a drunk 18-year-old man was attacked and killed in Rosario del Yata, Bolivia. In 2012, a five-year-old Brazilian girl was attacked and killed by a shoal of piranhas, while recurring attacks in Piaui in 2011 resulted in 100 people being injured. Piranha attacks peak in the dry season when there is less food and the water levels are lower. Fatalities are rare, with the majority of attacks taking the form of bites to the feet and hands. Splashing tends to make piranhas more likely to attack, explaining why children are often injured during mass attacks of these creatures.

chatgpt: In a horrifying attack, swimmers in a popular Argentine river were left injured after being attacked by palometas, a vicious species of piranha. The incident occurred in the same river where 70 people were injured in a similar attack just last month. According to experts, the hot weather and a lower number of predators in the area could be contributing factors to the recent attacks. The incident took place on Sunday afternoon in the Paraná River, which is located in the northeastern province of Corrientes. While some of the victims required medical attention, thankfully none were reported to have been seriously injured. Following the attack, officials have warned people against swimming in the river, especially in areas where palometas are known to inhabit. The species is known for its sharp teeth and predatory nature, and can cause severe harm to both humans and other animals. Experts have suggested that the recent spate of attacks could be the result of the current hot weather conditions in the area. As the water temperatures rise, palometas are more likely to attack humans who venture into their habitat. Furthermore, the lower number of predators in the river could be leading to an increase in the palometa population. With fewer predators to keep their numbers in check, the species has been able to thrive and become more aggressive. These attacks have sparked fears among locals and tourists who flock to the area during the summer months. The Paraná River is a popular spot for both swimming and fishing, and the recent attacks have raised concerns about the safety of such activities. Officials have stressed the importance of taking precautions when entering the water, including avoiding areas where palometas are known to be present. They have also urged swimmers to wear protective clothing, such as wetsuits, to reduce the risk of injury. In addition to the dangers posed by palometas, health officials have warned of other potential hazards in the river, including bacterial infections and the risk of drowning. Despite the risks, many locals and tourists continue to visit the Paraná River and other nearby waterways for recreational activities. Officials are calling for increased awareness and caution when participating in such activities, in order to prevent further attacks and injuries. The recent spate of palometa attacks has highlighted the need for greater conservation efforts and awareness regarding the dangers of these and other predatory species. As the weather continues to heat up and more people venture out into the water, it is essential that everyone takes the necessary precautions to stay safe and avoid harm.
