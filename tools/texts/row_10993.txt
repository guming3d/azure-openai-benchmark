Court: Actor Steven Berkoff has been banned from driving for six months because he ran a red light last year . James Bond villain Steven Berkoff has been banned from driving after jumping a red light, despite maintaining he was trying to get out of the way of a police car. The veteran actor, writer and director, 75, who played General Orlov in Octopussy alongside Roger Moore, said he had not meant to break the law. In a letter read out at City of London Magistrates' Court he claimed while driving his VW Beetle through Central London: 'I heard a siren in the near distance and turned to get out of its way.' But he still pleaded guilty to failing to comply with traffic signals on October 25 last year, earning himself a six-month ban from driving. Berkoff, who has been caught speeding twice in the last two years and ran another red light in March 2012, already had nine points on his licence. He was handed three more points today, leading to automatic disqualification. 'Mr Berkoff was driving a Volkswagen Beetle motor vehicle in Upper Thames Street, at the junction with Queen Street Place', said prosecutor Varinder Hayre. 'He crossed the stop line when the light had been red for 1.5 seconds, and he was at a speed of 27mph. 'The police did not offer an immediate conditional offer due to the time the lights had been red.' Berkoff, star of movies including Beverley Hill Cop and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, initially gave the court his Californian driving licence number, but checks showed he also holds a UK licence. 'Police were given a DVLA notice with nine penalty points, meaning he is liable for disqualification under the totting up procedure', said Ms Hayre. Famous: The star of stage and screen is perhaps best known for his role as Bond villain General Orlov, shown here in Octopussy . Berkoff's case was in court last month to be dealt with, but it was adjourned so he could be warned he was facing a ban. The star was offered a chance to tell magistrates why he should be spared from disqualification, but he did not show up to court. Berkoff was given six points after being caught speeding on September 18, 2010, and March 11, 2012, and another three points for driving through a red light on March 13, 2012. Magistrates also fined him £300 for the offence, and he was ordered to pay £85 court costs and a £30 victim surcharge. Berkoff, of Limehouse, east London, pleaded guilty by post to failing to comply with a red light signal.

chatgpt: Actor Steven Berkoff has been banned from driving for six months after reaching 12 points on his license. The ban was imposed after Berkoff pleaded guilty to failing to comply with traffic signals. Appearing in court, Berkoff told the magistrate, "I heard a siren and turned to get out of its way." However, this was not sufficient to avoid a ban, which could have a significant impact on the actor's work in the industry. Berkoff is best known for his roles in Octopussy and The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, but his driving ban may curtail his opportunities on set. Despite this, he admitted that he understood the reasons for the ban and would seek other modes of transport in future. The case highlights the importance of complying with traffic signals, even if it seems inconvenient at the time. Drivers should always be aware of their surroundings and be prepared to take evasive action if necessary. Magistrates have a responsibility to protect the public from dangerous drivers, and this includes imposing driving bans when warranted. While Berkoff may find the six-month ban challenging, it is a necessary consequence of his actions. This is not the first time that Berkoff has been in trouble with the law. In 2014, he was fined for driving while using a mobile phone, which carries penalty points and a fine of up to £1,000. The actor is not alone in facing a driving ban. Last year, over 47,000 drivers in the UK were banned for reaching 12 or more penalty points on their license. This highlights the importance of safe driving practices and the consequences of not following the rules of the road. In conclusion, Steven Berkoff's six-month driving ban serves as a reminder that even celebrities are not above the law. Drivers must be responsible and follow traffic signals, and those who don't will face the consequences. Actors like Berkoff will have to find alternative modes of transport to ensure they can continue to work while keeping themselves and others safe on the roads.
