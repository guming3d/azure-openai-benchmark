article: (CNN) -- It's not being called a bear attack yet. But authorities are setting traps and scouring parts of central Florida for the animal that mauled a woman and left her face severely injured. The woman, identified as 54-year-old Susan Chalfant, was walking her dogs in Longwood when she was wounded. Her face bloodied, she rushed to the house of a neighbor, who called 911. "She thinks it was a bear," the neighbor said in the 911 call. "How old is she?" the dispatched asked. "I can't tell," the neighbor replied. "She's so bloodied, I can't tell." Authorities say the woman is resting in a hospital. Florida Fish and Wildlife spokeswoman Karen Parker said officials aren't ready to call the case a bear "attack" yet because it's not clear what led up to the incident. "We're calling it a bear incident simply because we simply don't know what happened," Parker said. "Bears are very, very elusive. They're pretty much more afraid of you than you are of them, and normally when they see a human and they've not been fed and have not been habituated -- they're going to run away. They don't want to encounter us any more than we want to encounter them." A common sight . Neighbors in Longwood, north of Orlando, say bears often roam through the area -- especially when looking for food thrown out by humans. "There's an actual walkway of the bears between my home and the immediate neighbor," said one resident, who only wanted to be identified as Richard. "We see them on a regular basis, especially the nights before garbage pickups." Wildlife officials say if homeowners aren't careful with their trash, the bears will keep showing up. "Unless we get the full cooperation with everybody in every neighborhood around here, the bears are going to come in for a free lunch," Parker said. Whose territory? Unprovoked black bear attacks in Florida are extremely rare. The first one ever documented by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission was last year. The problem, biologists say, is that people are now living in areas that bears once called home. And bears like to roam. If wildlife officials catch a bear in the traps, they'll try to determine if it's the same one that injured the woman through DNA testing. If the results match up, the bear will likely be euthanized. 12-year-old bear attack survivor: 'I just thought I was going to die' CNN's John Couwels contributed to this report.

chatgpt: A woman was injured in a "bear incident" while walking her dogs near Orlando, Florida yesterday. According to reports, the attack was unprovoked, marking a rare occurrence in the area. Biologists say that humans are encroaching on areas that used to be natural habitats for bears, which is causing an increase in encounters between the two species. Black bear sightings are not uncommon in the Orlando area, especially around the time of trash pickups as they are attracted to the scent of food. Some residents have reported seeing bears in their backyards or crossing the street, but actual attacks on humans are rare. The woman in this incident was out for a routine walk with her dogs when the bear approached and attacked. Thankfully, she was able to fight the bear off and eventually make it to a nearby hospital for treatment. Her condition is currently unknown. Authorities are urging residents to be cautious and aware of their surroundings when walking outside, especially in areas where bear sightings have been reported. They recommend walking with a partner or group, making loud noises to alert nearby animals, and carrying deterrents such as bear spray. Biologists say that as Florida's human population continues to grow, more and more natural habitats for wildlife are being converted into residential areas. This means that bears, along with other wildlife, are now living closer to humans than ever before. To prevent future incidents, authorities are exploring ways to reduce human-bear interactions. This includes educating residents on how to coexist with bears, protecting their natural habitats, and controlling food sources that attract them into residential areas. In conclusion, the unprovoked black bear attack on a woman walking her dogs near Orlando is a rare occurrence, but highlights the need for humans to be cautious in areas where wildlife is present. As more and more people move into areas that were once natural habitats for bears and other wildlife, it's important to remember that we're sharing the land with these animals and must learn to coexist peacefully.
