article: Los Angeles (CNN) -- Darrel Folkert of Redondo Beach, California, stood next to a mailbox near the finish line of the Boston Marathon to cheer on his wife as she completed the race. Moments later he was suddenly thrown by a loud explosion that shattered windows behind him, lifted tables from their foundations and tossed chairs along the sidewalk. "He was standing right next to the mailbox when it exploded," his wife, Jac Bost, told CNN in a phone interview. The mailbox, one of the only objects left intact after the second explosion and the site where authorities have focused their investigation, may have saved Folkert's life. He suffered non-life-threatening puncture wounds to the leg and returned last week to Los Angeles, where he is recovering, Bost said. Bombings destroy dancer's foot, but not her spirit . Folkert and Bost, both 42, are avid ultra-marathon runners, competing in events with distances of up to 50 miles. Bost, a marketing executive, was competing in her seventh Boston Marathon and was less than a quarter mile away from the finish line when she heard a loud boom. She said organizers stopped her as word spread of an explosion and people began frantically running away from the scene. At first, she did not know what had happened to her husband, but strangers lent her a phone so she could contact him. Meanwhile, two men carried an injured Folkert to a nearby store, where they called 911 and lent him a phone to call relatives, she said. "It was the extreme generosity of people of Boston who offered to help that deserve the praise in the aftermath of what happened," she said. Folkert, who is expected to fully recover, and Bost are hoping to locate the two men who treated him at the scene and the others who helped them reunite, Bost said. "Everyone in the city of Boston was phenomenal, and I can't understate the level of generosity we received," she said. Site of Blasts reopens .

chatgpt: A California man who was standing near a mailbox at the finish line of the Boston Marathon on Monday, April 15, 2019, miraculously survived after a second bomb exploded, sending debris flying. The man, whose name has not been released, was cheering for his wife as she completed the race when the bomb went off. The blast sent debris flying in all directions, but the mailbox near where the man was standing somehow managed to survive the blast. Despite being in close proximity to the explosion, the man survived with only puncture wounds to his legs. The incident occurred at 2:49 PM, just moments after the first bomb had detonated, killing three spectators and injuring more than 260 others. The second bomb was placed just a short distance away and exploded just seconds later. The man, who was visiting Boston from California to support his wife in the race, spoke with local media following the incident, expressing his shock and disbelief at what had just happened. "I was standing by the mailbox, watching my wife finish the race when suddenly there was this huge explosion and debris flying everywhere," he said. "I couldn't believe it. I never thought something like this could happen at the Boston Marathon." Police and emergency services quickly responded to the scene, treating those who were injured and securing the area. The man was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment of his injuries but was released the same day. The Boston Marathon has been a beloved event since its inception in 1897, attracting runners and spectators from all over the world. In 2019, more than 30,000 runners participated in the race, and an estimated 1 million spectators lined the streets to cheer them on. While the bombing in 2013 was a tragic and shocking event, the resilience of the Boston community and the participants in the race was on full display. The man who survived the explosion near the mailbox is just one example of this resilience, and serves as a reminder of the incredible courage and strength that is embodied by the Boston Marathon.
