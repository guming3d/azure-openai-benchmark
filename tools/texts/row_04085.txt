chatgpt: A red Ferrari 458 Italia has been involved in a collision in a residential area in London. The 202mph car left the road and hit parked cars before colliding with a pillar. The vehicle then went on to knock into two more parked cars before coming to rest against a fourth on the pavement.  Police and emergency services were quickly on the scene, responding to reports of the high-speed accident. Eyewitnesses reported that the driver of the Ferrari was seen moments before, driving erratically and swerving between lanes. They suspect that the driver lost control, which caused the collision. The police have released a statement saying that the driver is a 35-year-old businessman who was taken to the hospital to receive treatment for minor injuries. There were no other persons inside the Ferrari during the crash. No bystanders were injured in the accident.  The damage to the cars on the road is substantial. The parked cars that were hit by the Ferrari were severely damaged, and debris from the collision was strewn across the pavement. The roof of the Ferrari was smashed, and the doors had caved in, causing the driver to be trapped inside. The incident has caused significant disruption to the area, as the road was closed off for several hours while the scene was cleared, and the police conducted their investigation. The Ferrari has since been removed from the pavement and taken to a nearby compound for further analysis. Police investigators have said that the driver of the Ferrari may face charges for careless driving, which can result in a hefty fine and points being added to the driver's license. Reckless driving can also result in a driving ban, which could have serious consequences for the driver's business and personal life. The incident serves as a reminder to all drivers that speed and reckless driving can have serious and even fatal consequences. It is essential to drive responsibly and follow the rules of the road to protect oneself and others around them. The police are urging anyone with information about the Ferrari collision to come forward, as they continue to investigate the incident.
