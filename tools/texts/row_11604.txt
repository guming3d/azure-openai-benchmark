article: It's not uncommon to see a dog on the back of a flat-bed truck, perhaps at a stretch, even the odd pig - but a horse? Police in the northern New Zealand town of Kaitaia are stunned by what they have seen - going as far as posting the comment 'speechless' on social media. And animal welfare groups have also expressed their anger, amid claims it was no leisurely drive around the block. The ute is believed to have topped 100 kilometres an hour on a state highway. No, this is not a horse float. Police in the northern New Zealand town of Kaitaia are stunned by what they have seen - going as far as posting the comment 'speechless' on social media after photos showed an untethered horse riding on the back of a table-top truck . Authorities are hoping their decision to post the image on Facebook, which shows the horse standing in the back, apparently without any sort of restraint, will lead to the identity of the owner. It has also sparked much debate about road transport rules in parts of New Zealand. Houhora constable Tracee Knowler told the Northern Advocate the horse had been spotted travelling around Northland on the back of the ute quite a few times recently, and in one case a motorist had reported it topping speeds of 100kph on a local highway. Houhora Police confirming this in the statement: 'This vehicle had been seen at open road speed on State Highway One.' NZ Police say other motorists have reported seeing the table-top travel at speeds of 100kph on a highway with the untethered horse in the back . Some social media comments have taken a light-hearted look at the matter, referring to 'the tail-gate being open' or 'how much horse-power does that make it?' But most have taken a more serious tone, including local police. TVNZ quoted Houhora Police as providing this statement: 'Looking at the horse it seems relaxed - I don't think anyone would deny that'. 'However, transporting a horse in that manner on that truck with no sides to speak of, on open and at the moment extremely busy roads is just crazy and dangerous to everybody using the road including the horse. 'There is nothing to stop that horse or part of it going over the side of the truck. 'So you can say it's quiet, trained etc. - but what if the driver has to slam on the brakes or gets hit by another vehicle? 'Or as someone has said it gets spooked by something like a fire truck and siren? I too have seen other horses transported on the backs of trucks - but never have I seen one on a truck without high sides.'

chatgpt: The New Zealand Police are searching for the owner of a table-top vehicle after reports emerged that a horse was spotted unrestrained on the back of the ute as it drove around the streets. The alarming sight has left animal welfare activists horrified and concerned for the safety of the animal, as well as the motorists sharing the road with the table-top vehicle. Eye-witnesses have reported that the horse appeared to be balancing precariously on the back of the ute as it rode along. Despite this, it seems that the driver of the vehicle was unconcerned with the animal's welfare and continued to drive at high speeds. Other reports have suggested that the table-top vehicle has been spotted on the highway travelling at a staggering 100 kilometres per hour. This is a potentially dangerous situation, both for the horse that is extremely vulnerable in this situation, and for other road users. The police are now urging members of the public to come forward if they have any information regarding the whereabouts of the horse and its owner. It is vital for the safety of everyone involved that this matter is taken seriously. Animal welfare groups are unsurprisingly calling for stricter regulations around the transportation of livestock. They argue that the incident highlights just how vulnerable animals can be when they are transported in this way. Some believe that New Zealand needs to consider introducing licenses or safety checks for those who wish to transport animals in a similar manner. This could potentially prevent situations such as this one from happening in future. Animal welfare activists are also calling for more education for horse owners on the correct methods of transportation. The proper use of horse floats or trailers is crucial to ensure the safety and wellbeing of animals during transit. The situation has generated widespread outrage and concern amongst the New Zealand public, with many calling for the driver of the table-top vehicle to be held accountable for their reckless behavior. As the police continue their search for the owner of the table-top vehicle and the horse in question, it is clear that this is a matter that needs to be addressed urgently. The safety of animals and other road users alike should always be the top priority in situations like this one. In conclusion, the police's search for the owner of the table-top continues, but this incident has certainly raised concerns about the transportation of livestock in New Zealand. Hopefully, it will lead to a debate around ensuring the safety and welfare of animals during transit, as well as stricter regulations for those who transport them.
