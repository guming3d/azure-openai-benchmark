Swan Guard Sheng Liang added: 'I have been caring for swans for years and I admit that this is the first time I have every come across anything like this. 'We think it must have happened when she fell asleep with a wet beak. 'We managed to lure her towards us with some food and then took her to our swan house where we care for injured or sick swans.

chatgpt: Residents in the Jiangsu province of China were stunned to see a swan with its beak frozen shut swimming in a local river. The bizarre sight was witnessed by locals who were feeding ducks in the frozen river. The swan was unable to eat, leading to concerns about its health and survival. The authorities were quickly alerted to the situation, and a team of Swan Guard members were dispatched to take care of the animal. They arrived at the location of the swan and immediately began their examination. They concluded that the swan had fallen asleep in the freezing conditions with its beak still wet. This caused the beak to freeze shut, leading to the bird's inability to feed itself. The Swan Guard team quickly sprang into action to help the swan. They carefully transported the animal to a warm room where the ice on its beak could be slowly melted. The team monitored the swan's health closely throughout the process. After several hours, the swan's beak finally thawed, and the team carefully released it back into the river. The animal swam in the water gracefully, much to the delight of the gathered locals who had been concerned for its well-being. The Swan Guard team reminded locals to be mindful of how they feed wildlife in the winter months. They advised people to scatter small portions of food so the swans, ducks, and other animals can safely consume it without getting their beaks wet. This is not unusual for swans to be seen in the Chinese rivers, but the frozen beak is a rare sight and shows the extreme conditions that the animals are exposed to in the winter. While the incident highlighted the dedication of local wildlife authorities in the region, it also highlights the need for continued caution during winter months, both for the wildlife and the public. This incident serves as a reminder that we must protect our wildlife, in particular during winter months, by observing our feeding practices and giving them shelter when they require it. We must all continue to be vigilant and mindful of the incredible creatures that share our world. As for the swan, thanks to the quick thinking and dedication of the local Swan Guard, it is now happily swimming in the river once again, free from any further harm or danger.
