article: London, England (CNN) -- Britain's Prince William and fiancee Kate Middleton made their first official engagement as a couple Thursday, launching a lifeboat in Wales. The pair, who are due to marry in April, officially named the "Hereford Endeavour" lifeboat in a ceremony at the Trearddur Bay Lifeboat Station in Anglesey, North Wales.  Middleton, wearing a Vivien Sheriff black-feathered beret, three-quarter length cream coat and suede boots, poured a bottle of champagne over the lifeboat after Prince William made a speech commending the efforts of the volunteers and rescue crew. "We effectively have two launches today," said CNN royal contributor Mark Saunders. "The launch of the lifeboat by William and Catherine and, at the same time, the launch of William and Catherine into this celebrity saturated world they are going to be living in." Despite the modest nature of the event, hundreds of people turned out to watch the royal couple conduct their first official duty together. "In 20 years of royal reporting I've never witnessed quite such excitement for such a single job," said Saunders. One onlooker told CNN: "It's lovely... I would have thought more people would have brought flowers and things for them but it's lovely... It's low key which is what he (Prince William) wanted." It's the first public appearance the couple has made since they announced their engagement last November. "It's a very low-key event, launching a lifeboat on the island where they both live...it's a very good debut event for them," said Saunders. "They have a very good relationship with the locals here, they are often seen at the local supermarket and buying wine from the local off-license. So for a first event, they couldn't have picked a better one." The reason for such a low-key ceremony, says Saunders, is to prepare Middleton for life as a royal. "(The royal family) have learnt many lessons from when Princess Diana first joined the royal family. "Diana was just thrown in the deep end and absolutely given no guidance whatsoever. They're making sure this time round Catherine is well prepared," he said. After naming the new Atlantic 85 lifeboat, Prince William and Middleton met members of the charity's lifeboat crew along with fundraising volunteers and were given a demonstration of the vessel's capabilities. In a statement issued before the ceremony, Lifeboat's Operations Manager, Aubrey Diggle said: "It's an honor to have Prince William and Miss Middleton at our naming ceremony. "Naming a new lifeboat is always a special occasion for the charity where we can thank our supporters and fundraisers. Having the royal couple there will make the day even more memorable for the whole community." The couple currently reside in Anglesey while Prince William serves as an RAF search and rescue helicopter pilot.

chatgpt: Prince William and Kate Middleton stepped out together for their first official engagement since their marriage at a lifeboat naming ceremony in Anglesey, north Wales. The couple currently live in Anglesey, where Prince William serves as an RAF pilot. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were in high spirits as they made their way to the event, with Kate stunning in a cream-coloured coat-dress and a matching fascinator. She accessorized her outfit with a pair of nude heels and delicate jewellery, while her hair was styled in loose waves. The event was hosted by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), which named its new Atlantic 85-class lifeboat "Hereford Endeavour". The lifeboat was dedicated to the people of Herefordshire, in recognition of their support for the RNLI over the years. Prince William and Kate, who are both supporters of the RNLI, seemed delighted to be in attendance. They spoke to several members of the lifeboat crew and their families, as well as representatives from the RNLI and Herefordshire. During the ceremony, Prince William gave a speech in which he praised the bravery and dedication of the RNLI volunteers. He also thanked the people of Herefordshire for their support, saying that their generosity had helped to save countless lives at sea. "It is a tremendous honour for me and my wife to be here today to witness the naming of this new lifeboat," Prince William said. "The RNLI is an incredible organisation that does vital work all around the United Kingdom and Ireland. Their selfless volunteers put their lives on the line to save others, and we owe them all a great debt of gratitude." Kate also spoke briefly, saying that she was "so proud of everyone involved in the RNLI". She added, "It is wonderful to see the Herefordshire community recognised in this way, and I know that this new lifeboat will serve the people of Anglesey and beyond for many years to come." After the ceremony, the royal couple toured the lifeboat and met with some of the RNLI volunteers. They also signed the visitors' book and presented a plaque to the crew. Overall, the event was a huge success and a fitting tribute to the RNLI and the people of Herefordshire. Prince William and Kate looked relaxed and happy throughout the engagement, and their easy rapport with the RNLI volunteers and staff was clear to see.
