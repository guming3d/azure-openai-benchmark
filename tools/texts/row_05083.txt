chatgpt: Two elderly residents of a New Jersey apartment complex were arrested on charges related to drug possession and prostitution. James Parham, a 75-year-old man, is accused of providing prostitutes to his younger neighbors while Cheryl Chaney, 66, was found to have a stash of crack cocaine and drug paraphernalia in her apartment.  The arrests came after numerous complaints from other elderly residents of the apartment complex about the increasing presence of drunks and addicts in their building. The residents were fearful for their safety due to the activities of these individuals, such as vandalizing property and breaking into apartments.  Parham was arrested on charges of promoting prostitution and maintaining a nuisance. According to the prosecutor's office, Parham allegedly provided prostitutes to his younger neighbors in exchange for money or drugs. It is unclear how long this activity had been going on before he was caught. Chaney was arrested on charges of drug possession and possession of drug paraphernalia. Police found crack cocaine and drug paraphernalia in her apartment during a search. It is unclear whether she was selling drugs to other tenants in the apartment complex. The arrests of both Parham and Chaney brought relief to the other elderly residents of the apartment complex. "We have been living in fear for months because of the drunks and addicts that Parham and Chaney were bringing into the building. We couldn't even go outside without feeling scared," said one resident who wished to remain anonymous.  The prosecutor's office also thanked the residents who came forward with information about the activities of Parham and Chaney. "We are grateful to the residents who reported these activities to us. We take the safety of our elderly residents very seriously and will do everything in our power to protect them from harm," said the prosecutor. The arrests serve as a reminder that criminal activity can happen anywhere, even in places where one might least expect it. The case of Parham and Chaney sheds light on the importance of community policing and neighborhood watch programs in ensuring the safety of residents in apartment complexes and other shared living spaces.  It is unclear what will happen to Parham and Chaney next, though they are due to appear in court in the coming weeks. The prosecutor's office has said that it will continue to investigate this case and take any necessary further action to ensure the safety of the elderly residents of the apartment complex.
