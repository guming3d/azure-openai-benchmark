article: Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- A giant panda cub -- the only one this year in the United States -- was born early Wednesday at Zoo Atlanta, the zoo said in a statement. Lun Lun, a 13-year-old female panda, gave birth to the cub at 5:39 a.m. ET in a specially prepared birthing den inside the zoo's giant panda building, according to the statement. "Lun Lun appears to be providing appropriate care for her cub, which is roughly the size of a cell phone," the statement said. The facility's animal management and veterinary teams were monitoring the mother and cub round-the-clock, and "a preliminary veterinary checkup will be performed as soon as staff is able to remove the cub without disrupting maternal care." The cub is the third for Lun Lun and mate Yang Yang. It will be introduced to the public in spring 2011, the zoo said. Yang Yang, 13, and the cub's older brother, Xi Lan, remain on exhibit and will not be introduced to the new addition. "The separation is normal for giant pandas, which are solitary in the wild," the statement said. Zoo Atlanta announced Lun Lun's pregnancy last month. Zoos in Memphis, Tennessee; San Diego, California; and Washington also have pandas, but none produced a cub this year. The couple's firstborn, Mei Lan, has lived at China's Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding since February. She was born in September 2006. Xi Lan, born in August 2008, "remains one of the zoo's most popular and precocious animal stars" the statement said. All three births came about by artificial insemination. For the most recent cub, Lun Lun was artificially inseminated on June 13. "We are extremely excited about welcoming Lun Lun's and Yang Yang's third cub, and proud of the success of Zoo Atlanta's giant panda program," said Dwight Lawson, the zoo's deputy director. "This is a joy we share with the city of Atlanta, our colleagues in China and our counterparts at fellow zoological organizations housing giant pandas in the U.S." Zoo Atlanta called the birth "a significant achievement for global efforts to save a critically endangered species." Fewer than 1,600 giant pandas are estimated to remain in the wild, and about 280 reside in zoos -- 11 of them in the United States. Before the cub makes its public debut, images will be available at the zoo's panda conservation center and on its "PandaCam," accessible online. Lun Lun and Yang Yang were born in China. They have lived with each other since they were a year old and came as a pair to Zoo Atlanta in 1999.

chatgpt: Atlanta, GA - The Atlanta Zoo welcomed a new addition to their family early this morning as Lun Lun, a 22-year-old giant panda, gave birth to a healthy cub at 5:39 a.m. ET. This is the third cub for Lun Lun and Yang Yang, who have been at the zoo since 1999. The birth was a carefully planned event, with zookeepers closely monitoring Lun Lun throughout her pregnancy. The mother and cub are now being watched around-the-clock, as it's crucial to ensure the cub's health and safety during these crucial first few weeks. "We're thrilled to welcome this new addition to our giant panda family," said Raymond King, president and CEO of Zoo Atlanta. "It's always an exciting time when a new cub is born, and we're looking forward to watching this little one grow and thrive under the care of Lun Lun and our dedicated team of animal care professionals." The sex of the cub has yet to be determined, as it's still too early to tell. The panda team will wait a few weeks before performing a checkup, which will include weighing and measuring the cub, as well as giving it its first vaccinations. Giant pandas are an endangered species, with only an estimated 1,800 left in the wild. The Atlanta Zoo is part of a conservation program that is working to breed and preserve these animals in captivity. Lun Lun and Yang Yang have already produced two other cubs, Mei Lan and Xi Lan, who now reside in China. "We're proud to be playing a role in the conservation of these magnificent creatures," said King. "Every birth is a step forward in preserving this important species for future generations." While the birth of this new cub is certainly cause for celebration, it's important to remember the challenges facing giant pandas in the wild. Deforestation, habitat loss, and poaching are all major threats to their survival, and conservation efforts are more important now than ever before. In the meantime, however, the Atlanta Zoo will continue to celebrate the arrival of its newest resident. Visitors to the zoo will now have the opportunity to see Lun Lun and her cub up close, although zookeepers have reminded visitors to keep their distance and respect the animals' space during this crucial bonding period. As for the name of the new cub, that has yet to be determined. The Atlanta Zoo has announced that it will be holding a contest, open to zoo members and visitors, to choose a name for the newest member of their panda family. The winning name will be announced in the weeks to come.
