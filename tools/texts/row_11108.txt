article: Chipotle says it stopped serving pork at hundreds of its restaurants after suspending a supplier that violated its standards. Chris Arnold, a spokesman for the burrito chain, told The Associated Press it's the first time the company stopped serving a topping for its burritos and bowls. He said Chipotle learned of the violation by the supplier on Friday through a routine audit, and did not have a timeline for when carnitas would return to affected stores, about a third of its total base. 'It's hard to say how long it will last,' he said. Removed: Chipotle said a third of its stores are no longer serving the carnitas filling because of concerns over how pigs were being treated . In New York City on Tuesday, a sign on the door of a Chipotle location stated: 'SORRY, NO CARNITAS.' Arnold said most of the issues related to the violations concerned the housing for the pigs. Chipotle demands that its suppliers raise pigs in humane conditions with access to the outdoors, rather than in cramped pens. On other occasions, Chipotle customers may have noticed signs saying a restaurant is serving meat that doesn't meet the company's 'responsibly raised' standards. That's typically because Chipotle has trouble securing supplies of beef raised without antibiotics or hormones, Arnold said. The company then serves beef that was 'conventionally raised.' That is not happening with the carnitas, however. 'In this case, we won't make that kind of substitution,' Arnold said in an email. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. had 1,724 restaurants as of last September. The Denver-based chain has enjoyed strong sales growth, in part by positioning its food as a higher quality alternative to traditional fast-food restaurants. In the latest quarter, sales surged 19.8 percent at established locations. Paul Shapiro, vice president of farm animal protection for The Humane Society of the United States, said that most breeding pigs in the country are kept in gestation crates with concrete floors. Pigs that are raised with access to the outdoors or bedding represent a 'very small portion of the pork industry,' he said. Even among farms where pigs have better conditions, Shapiro said access to the outdoors can vary. 'It doesn't mean these animals are living in ideal conditions on Old MacDonald's farm,' he said. As for Chipotle, Arnold said the company is looking at a variety of ways to remedy its carnitas shortage, including the use of different cuts of pork or increasing orders from other suppliers. He said he hopes the supplier in question will fix its issues and eventually come 'back on board.' Arnold said the carnitas topping typically accounts for about 6 to 7 percent of entree orders; chicken is the most popular topping.

chatgpt: Fast-casual burrito chain Chipotle has withdrawn the popular carnitas topping from one-third of its US stores following an audit of suppliers that found some farmers weren’t meeting animal welfare standards.  The company, famous for its “food with integrity” slogan, prides itself on its sustainability practices, and sources about 90% of its meat from farms that meet its animal welfare standards. However, Chipotle stated that some of its carnitas suppliers had violated its animal welfare policies, leading to the withdrawal of the product. Carnitas is a slow-cooked, pulled pork dish that is a popular topping for burritos, tacos, and bowls. The filling is chosen by about 7% of Chipotle customers and is a significant part of the company’s menu offerings. The company’s CEO, Brian Niccol, said in a statement that the decision to withdraw carnitas was not taken lightly. “We’re committed to the humane treatment of animals, but we also have a responsibility to serve safe, high-quality food,” he said. Customers at affected Chipotle stores will have to choose from the chain’s other meat offerings, including chicken, beef, and sofritas (a vegan option). The company is yet to announce when the carnitas topping will return, as it seeks to find new suppliers that meet its animal welfare policies and standards. This is not the first time Chipotle has faced challenges with its meat supply chain. In 2015, the company faced a crisis when its E. coli outbreak was linked to its food supply chain. The chain struggled to recover amid plummeting profits and PR troubles, leading to the appointment of Niccol as CEO in 2018. Since joining the company, Niccol has sought to restore Chipotle’s reputation by focusing on innovation, marketing campaigns, and partnerships with third-party delivery platforms. The company has also eliminated artificial ingredients from its menu and opened new locations across the US. Withdrawing carnitas from some stores and potentially losing customers might seem like a step backward for the company, but Chipotle seems committed to its animal welfare policies. The decision also fits with the company’s broader strategy of pursuing sustainable practices that align with customer preferences. Chipotle’s animal welfare standards require its suppliers to use humane and sustainable farming practices, avoid antibiotics and growth hormones, and prioritize the welfare of the animals. While the company has not revealed which suppliers were failing to meet its standards, it has said that it will work with them to make improvements. The impact of the decision on the company’s bottom line remains to be seen, but some customers have expressed frustration on social media about the limited menu options. However, other customers have praised Chipotle for sticking to its values and refusing to compromise on animal welfare. In recent years, consumers have become increasingly concerned about the sourcing and production of their food. Companies like Chipotle are recognizing this trend and attempting to align their practices with consumers’ values to differentiate themselves in an increasingly competitive market. Ultimately, the company’s decision to withdraw carnitas from some stores sends a clear message that when it comes to its commitment to responsible sourcing, it’s willing to make tough decisions.
