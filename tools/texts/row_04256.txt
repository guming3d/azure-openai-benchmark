Officers were called to Tilmanstone Salads factory (pictured), at an industrial estate on the outskirts of Dover, at 9.22am following reports of a 'suspicious group' in the area. They detained 12 suspected illegal immigrants . It comes after a group of suspected illegal immigrants were found in the back of a refrigerated yogurt lorry in Whitfield, near Dover in Kent, less than a week ago. They were found after banging on the door in a bid for help . Kent Police said 12 people were detained and handed over to the Home Office immigration enforcement team. Bakkavor, which owns the food preparation site, was unable to confirm how the group of people came to be on the site. A spokesman said: 'Bakkavor confirms that a group of unauthorised individuals entered its Tilmanstone Salads site today. 'The matter is now being managed by local police services.' The Tilmanstone Salads factory, which opened in 2001, employees around 750 workers and supplies in freshly prepared salads and vegetables to market leaders. On its website, Bakkavor says it ‘specialises in making and developing private label prepared foods for the top global grocery retailers and well-known international foodservice operators’. It lists Marks & Spencer, Waitrose, Tesco, Asda and Sainbsury’s among its clients. Earlier this month, crowds attempted to overpower officials and machine-gun wielding police in an attempt to board a Britain-bound P&O ferry in Calais, France. Ferry crews eventually had to pull a fire hose on them to stop . The detainees are the latest group to be held recently amid concerns from the British freight industry about migrants' ever-more-desperate attempts to reach the UK from Calais. The Freight Transport Association (FTA) has called for the European Union to bring in stricter border controls to deal with what it describes as a 'worsening situation'. Meanwhile, more than 3,000 people have signed an e-petition demanding the UK Government help solve the problems faced by British truckers. They want fines of up to £2,000 per migrant, which are imposed on lorry drivers and hauliers if stowaways are caught hiding inside their vehicles, to be scrapped.

chatgpt: Kent Police have detained 12 suspected immigrants after they were discovered at a food preparation factory in Dover, according to reports. Officers were called to Tilmanstone Salads following reports of a group of people seen at the site. The police dispatched a helicopter to help with the search and they began to detain everyone who was discovered within the premises. The incident, which occurred earlier this week, caught the attention of local residents who were surprised at how quickly the authorities responded to the situation. Many of the residents expressed their shock and confusion over the incident as the factory is a well-known food preparation plant and was shut during the night. Tilmanstone Salads, a well-known establishment, was a scene of police activity when officers began to search the premises. The police shone floodlights into the factory as they searched through the machinery, storage facilities and offices in the building. The police were thorough in their investigations and have compiled evidence and documentation surrounding the incident. Following the investigation and the subsequent arrest of the 12 people, they were handed over to the Home Office, where their status as immigrants will be assessed. The Home Office said that if the people detained are confirmed to be immigrants, then they will be dealt with under UK law, and any illegal immigrants will be deported.  The incident has raised questions about the safety and security of businesses in the sector surrounding the UK's borders. Some experts have suggested that this incident serves as a warning to businesses and that it is important to keep watch and report any suspicious activity. It is unclear how the suspected immigrants were able to gain access to the factory, but it highlights the vulnerability of facilities within the sector. The British government has faced several challenges in recent years with regards to immigration control. The country has been targeted by smugglers who use vulnerable individuals looking for a better life in the UK, causing them to travel across the English Channel in dangerous and often overcrowded boats. Experts say that illegal immigrants are a growing problem in the country and that it is important to be vigilant. Overall, this latest incident highlights the importance of comprehensive immigration control and the need for the UK government to continue to address the issue of immigration in the region. The Home Office has committed to securing the country's borders and tackling illegal immigration, and this latest incident serves as a stark reminder that the government must remain vigilant in order to protect the safety and security of residents and businesses alike.
