article: Angry and frustrated over both the search and rescue operation and the flow of information from South Korean authorities, dozens of relatives of missing ferry passengers intending to march in protest to Seoul were blocked by police from leaving Jindo. Early Sunday around 2 a.m, the family members left their temporary shelter at an indoor gym and demanded they be able to go to the Blue House -- the official residence of the South Korean President Park Geun-hye -- to present their complaints. The residence is located in the capital, Seoul -- some 275 miles north of Jindo. Jindo is the port city where the search, rescue and recovery operation has been based since the ferry, carrying 476 passengers, capsized and sank on Wednesday.Â Hundreds of passengers remain unaccounted for. A police cordon prevented the planned march from proceeding, witnesses said. A few scuffles broke out but no one was reported hurt. "We are not getting any help, so we want to go to the Blue House,' said Nam Sa Hyun, an older sister of a student who is missing from the ferry. "We want to tell the president about our situation." Transcript of desperate calls released . "For four days, there is no help. Right now, nobody is giving information on the missing. Our children are in the boat and there is no plan." Though the police were not aggressive to the protesting families, Nam questioned why there were so many officers at the site of anguished relatives. "They're not letting us get on the bus, the police are blocking us," she said. "They're not helping us, they're just blocking us." Several families stayed in the street, attempting to break through police lines in their march. Some families lay down on the ground, sleeping outside in the cold to express their displeasure. In a video sent to CNN, angry parents yelled at officials who were trying to convince the families to go back to the gym, which serves as a temporary shelter for families. "I can't believe them," a woman shouted at the official who was urging them to return. "Let's go on our way. Why do we sit here and listen to them?'

chatgpt: A group of families who have been living in a gymnasium in Seoul for four years attempted to take their grievances to South Korea's President Moon Jae-in on Thursday. The families have been seeking compensation after being forcibly evicted from their homes in the 1990s to make way for a redevelopment project. According to witnesses, the families, who had been sheltering in the gymnasium, marched out at night with banners and loudspeakers, hoping to have their voices heard. However, police blocked their path and prevented them from leaving the area. The families have been living in the gymnasium since 2017, hoping to draw attention to their plight and receive compensation. They say that they were not properly compensated for the loss of their homes or given adequate resettlement assistance. A spokesperson for the police said the authorities had blocked the families from leaving as a safety measure, and to avoid disruption to traffic in the area. The families have yet to receive a response from President Moon's office. Although South Korea has seen rapid economic growth over the past several decades, it has also experienced numerous conflicts over land and property rights. The government has faced criticism for its handling of such disputes, with many arguing that vulnerable groups such as low-income families and the elderly are frequently neglected. The families' struggle has gained national attention in recent years, with supporters staging rallies and demonstrations on their behalf. Some have accused the government of neglecting their plight and failing to provide adequate compensation and support. The standoff between the families and police highlights the need for meaningful dialogue and action to address the grievances of marginalized communities. It also underscores the importance of ensuring that citizens' rights to peaceful assembly and protest are protected. In a statement following the incident, a representative of the families said they would continue to fight for their rights and speak out against injustice. "We will not give up until we receive proper compensation and justice," the spokesperson said. "We urge the government to listen to our voices and take action to address our grievances."
