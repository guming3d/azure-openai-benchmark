Murdered Crimewatch presenter Jill Dando tried to get BBC bosses to investigate an alleged paedophile ring in the corporation, it has today been claimed . The former staff member, who asked to remain anonymous, told the Daily Star Sunday that she raised the claims with management in the mid 1990s. The source said that the names were 'surprisingly big'. She said: 'I think she was quite shocked when told about images of children and that information on how to join this horrible paedophile ring was freely available.' They added that Ms Dando had also been told that female work colleagues told her they had been groped or assaulted, and that nothing had been done. A former friend and retired BBC worker has claimed that the television host was told that 'big name stars' and BBC staff were involved in abuse . 'She compiled a file of complaints but she was not really an investigative journalist, just a presenter. 'She passed the information to someone else and they gave it back. No one wanted to know.' The BBC said it had not seen anything to substantiate the claims. Miss Dando, 37, was gunned down outside her home in Fulham, west London, on April 26, 1999, moments after stepping out of her car. Dando was killed with a single muffled bullet to the skull and neighbours found her in a pool of blood on her doorstep in a crime that shocked Britain. Part-time stuntman Barry George was jailed for the killing in 2001, but his conviction was overturned in August 2008 following the emergence of fresh evidence. Her killer has never been found.

chatgpt: A retired BBC worker recently claimed that "big names" were involved in abuse, and that the network failed to take appropriate action despite being presented with evidence. The worker in question, who has not been identified, alleged that popular television host Jill Dando handed a file containing evidence of abuse to management, but that nothing was done about it. The claims were first reported by a UK-based newspaper, which did not reveal the identity of the retired worker. According to the report, the worker alleged that the file contained information about abuse committed by individuals who were well-known within the entertainment industry, including at the BBC. In response to the claims, a spokesperson for the BBC stated that the network had not seen anything to substantiate the allegations. The spokesperson added that the BBC takes all allegations of abuse seriously and investigates them thoroughly. Jill Dando, who died in 1999, was a popular television presenter and journalist at the BBC. She was murdered outside her home in London, and her death remains unsolved. The claims made by the retired worker, if true, would suggest that Dando was aware of abuse within the industry and that she attempted to bring it to the attention of those in positions of power. The allegations come at a time when the entertainment industry is increasingly under scrutiny for its handling of allegations of abuse and misconduct. In recent years, numerous high-profile figures have been accused of misconduct, harassment, and abuse, leading to a wider conversation about the culture within the industry. The BBC has itself faced criticism for its handling of abuse allegations in the past. The network was embroiled in a scandal in 2012 after it emerged that television host Jimmy Savile had sexually abused dozens of individuals during his time at the BBC. The scandal resulted in numerous inquiries and led to significant changes in the way the network handles allegations of abuse. It remains to be seen whether the claims made by the retired BBC worker will be investigated further. However, the allegations add to a growing sense that there are still serious issues within the entertainment industry when it comes to abuse and misconduct. As the conversation around these issues continues, it is likely that more allegations of this kind will come to light, and that those in positions of power will come under increased scrutiny.
