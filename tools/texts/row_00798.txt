article: (CNN) -- Fluminense-playmaker Dario Conca has been named Brazil's player of the year for the second consecutive season, after he helped the Rio de Janeiro-based side to their first domestic title in 26 years. Argentine Conca created 18 goals over the course of the season, more than any other player in the league, and played a leading role as the club secured only its second Brazilian championship. A goal from striker Emerson was enough to give O Tricolor a 1-0 victory over relegated Guarani on Sunday, and ensure Muricy Ramalho's team finished the season top of the standings. Ramalho has now won the league in four of the last five seasons, after he won a trio of titles in a spell with Sao Paulo between 2006 and 2009. Conca, who has never been capped by Argentina, expressed his determination to build on this season's title triumph. "I'm pleased to be considered a fans' favorite at Fluminense and I hope to win a lot of titles here," the 27-year-old told the official FIFA website. The midfielder also stated he has enjoyed playing for the club and hopes to represent Fluminense for the rest of his career. "I've had the support of the fans, the squad and the coaching staff. I feel really at home at Fluminense and I'm treated so well here. If it were up to me, I'd finish my career here." Turning his attention to the international scene, Conca revealed he hopes his achievements in Brazil will catch the eye of Argentina coach Sergio Batista. "I dream of playing for my country's national team, it would be a huge honor. I left Argentina at a very young age and that makes things a bit trickier. "But I'm still very optimistic and I'm hoping that Fluminense's good campaign this year will boost my chances."
