chatgpt: In today's world, there is a gadget for everything, and the latest addition to this trend is the Smart Mug. Yes, you heard it right- a mug that not only holds your beverage but also determines its temperature. This innovation combines technology with everyday life to create an intelligent product that elevates an otherwise mundane experience. The Smart Mug is equipped with a temperature sensor, which detects the exact temperature of the liquid inside the mug.

Simply pour your drink into the Smart Mug, and it will do the rest. But that's not all, the Smart Mug also has a light that illuminates in different colors to indicate the ideal time to start drinking. Green indicates the drink is just the right temperature and it's time to sip, blue means the drink is too cold and requires heating, and red indicates that the drink is too warm and needs to cool down.
