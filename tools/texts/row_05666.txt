article: (CNN)Metro systems that travel underground in the United States may be unprepared for smoke or fire emergencies, National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Keith Holloway said Tuesday. The board wants a nationwide audit of transit systems, with emphasis on trains that operate in enclosed tunnels. The huge undertaking would be the first of its kind, Holloway said. The call for an audit comes as investigators look into a January 12 fatal accident that happened near the L'Enfant Plaza Metro Station in Washington. An electrical malfunction inside the tunnel caused train cars to fill with smoke. Passengers who were trapped inside said they struggled to breathe. One female passenger died. The Washington Metro system, operated by a multistate compact known as WMATA, has ventilation fans at strategic locations designed to remove smoke and heat from the tunnels, but investigators found they were inadequate. "The ventilation strategy that WMATA implemented during the accident was not consistent with best practices." the NTSB said. Investigators also found Metro employees had no written procedures for dealing with ventilation during smoke and fire events underground. "The investigation to date has revealed that WMATA does not currently have the means to determine the exact location of a source of smoke in its tunnel network," the NTSB said. The findings in Washington raised concerns there could be similar problems in other transit systems across the country. Transit networks with significant portions of their tracks underground will be the focus of the audit. New York City's MTA, Washington's WMATA, Atlanta's MARTA, San Francisco's BART, Los Angeles's MTA, Boston's MBTA and Philadelphia's SEPTA would be included. In a letter, board members called on the Federal Transit Authority, a division of the Department of Transportation, to conduct the examination of tunnel ventilation systems as well as written emergency procedures for fire and smoke. The FTA has not yet decided if it will investigate. The agency said it "has not yet determined how an audit of this nature would be conducted or the potential impact such an audit would have on the transit riding public."

chatgpt: The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has called for an audit of transit systems operating in enclosed tunnels, with particular emphasis on metro trains. The call came as investigators continue to look into the fatal January accident involving a Metro train in Washington. According to the NTSB, the audit would primarily focus on the safety of train control systems and operator training. Transit systems in enclosed tunnels present unique risks due to the potential for fire and smoke inhalation, as well as the difficulty of evacuating passengers quickly in the event of an emergency. The January accident in Washington occurred when a Metro train encountered smoke in a tunnel, leading to the death of one passenger and the hospitalization of dozens more. The accident highlighted the risks of operating transit systems in enclosed spaces, and the need for improved safety measures and evacuation procedures. NTSB board member Earl Weener stated that the audit is necessary to ensure that transit systems are up to date with the latest safety standards, and that operators are adequately trained to handle emergency situations. The audit is expected to cover all transit systems operating in enclosed tunnels across the United States, including subways, light rails, and commuter trains. It will also examine the role of federal regulators in overseeing transit systems and ensuring compliance with safety regulations. The call for an audit has been welcomed by industry groups, who have long been advocating for increased investment in transit safety. John Samuelsen, President of the Transport Workers Union, stated that “the NTSB audit is a critical step towards ensuring that transit systems are safe for riders and workers alike.” The audit will likely take several months to complete, and its findings could have significant implications for the transit industry. In particular, transit operators may need to invest in new safety technologies and training programs to meet the NTSB’s recommendations. The NTSB has urged transit operators to take the findings of the audit seriously, and to prioritize the safety of passengers and workers. “It’s critical that we take action now to ensure that transit systems are safe and reliable for everyone who depends on them,” said Weener.
