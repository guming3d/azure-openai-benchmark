chatgpt: A Nigerian woman has been caught in a sham marriage fraud scheme after paying a man £1,000 to marry her in Cardiff. Uzoma Onwuha, who was born in Nigeria, was hoping to obtain a residency status in the United Kingdom through her fraudulent marriage to Robert Horvath. However, the two were quickly busted by the staff at the Cardiff register office who were suspicious of the couple's behavior. According to reports, Onwuha and Horvath could not provide any basic details about each other during the ceremony, raising the suspicions of the staff. The couple appeared to be doting on each other, although they could not even provide basic information such as their addresses, ages or occupations. One of the guests at the wedding even revealed that he was invited to the wedding after being found at a bus stop by the couple. The guest reportedly received an invitation from Onwuha and Horvath, who informed him that they wanted him to be a witness to their marriage. Unfortunately for the couple, their scheme was soon discovered, and they were both arrested on charges of fraud. Despite their attempts to fool the authorities, they were quickly caught, and their fraudulent marriage was exposed. Sham marriages have become an increasing problem in the UK, with many people attempting to use marriage as a way to gain residency or citizenship. In many cases, these marriages are arranged between two individuals who have never met each other before, and the entire thing is orchestrated by third-party individuals who charge those seeking to use it as a way to obtain legal residency in the country. Despite the existence of laws against such schemes, many individuals still attempt to carry them out. The authorities, however, are getting better at identifying these marriages and arresting those involved. In the case of Onwuha and Horvath, their attempts to cheat the system were quickly discovered, and they will now have to face the consequences of their actions. The matter has served as a warning to those who are contemplating a similar scheme as the authorities continue to crack down on sham marriages in the UK.
