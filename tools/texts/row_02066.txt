article: (CNN)  -- In trendy neighborhoods of Tokyo customers are lining up for vitamin injections that promise to improve health and beauty. A Japanese woman receives an intravenous vitamin supplement at the Tenteki Cafe in Tokyo. These intravenous vitamin "drips" are part of the latest quick-fix, health fad catching on in Japan: the IV cafe. Each drip pack contains saline solution and specific vitamins and minerals to target a particular health ailment or beauty concern. "I used to take vitamin supplements, but changed to the IV drip because I feel the effects more quickly," a 20-something woman at the Tenteki 10 Caf√© told CNN. She said she receives specific injections to get better skin, burn fat and boost her energy. There are 10 different varieties to choose from at Tenteki. The "orange" variety touts anti-aging properties, loaded with antioxidants. The "placenta pack" is said to help rejuvenate and ease muscle stiffness. Prices range from $20-$30 per injection, and nurses see about 30-40 people each day. Their most common patients are Japanese businessmen who work in the same office building. "I see a lot of businessmen who say they don't have time to sleep. They can't take a break from working and get the vitamin drip for an extra kick of energy," a Tenteki nurse told CNN. "Blue" is the most requested vitamin pack among these men: a concoction of B1 and vitamin E that claims to offer relief from exhaustion. Registered nurses and doctors administer the drips at Tenteki, but there's no conclusive medical evidence to back up the health claims. Many nutritionists actually caution against using injectable vitamin supplements because the quantities are not regulated. "More is not necessarily better...some vitamins and minerals can be toxic in high doses," particularly the fat-soluble ones which the body stores like Vitamins A, D, E and K, explained Claire Williamson, Nutrition Scientist at the British Nutrition Foundation. In Europe and the United States vitamin shots are popular among celebrities with hectic lifestyles and little time to sleep, particularly vitamin B 12. Former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell and singer Robbie Williams have both confirmed they've used the shots as part of their diets to maintain stamina during tours. Dermatological injections of Vitamin C are also popular among women hoping to keep their skin looking young. Former supermodel Cindy Crawford has admitted using such injections to keep her skin firm and wrinkle-free. According to Williamson, it does not matter if supplements are injected into the vein or into the skin. "At the end of the day it will go into the blood stream," she said. Most of these nutrients we can get sufficient from foods, nutrients tend to be better absorbed by the body if they are consumed in foods."

chatgpt: Intravenous vitamin boosts have taken Japan by storm. They have become the newest health fad among the Japanese population. The spike in popularity of vitamin injections comes as a growing number of people look for ways to improve their health and beauty. Vitamin injections involve the injection of a high dose of vitamins directly into the bloodstream. These injections target specific health conditions or beauty concerns such as wrinkles, acne, and hair loss. The trend has gained momentum, particularly among the country's celebrities, businessmen, and those experiencing fatigue. However, nutritionists are warning that these vitamin injections could result in an overdose. The body can only assimilate a limited amount of vitamins, and too much can result in adverse health effects. There is a high risk of overdosing on vitamins when high quantities of supplements are administered through injections. Therefore, experts advise consumers to be mindful of the amounts of vitamins they are consuming. Despite the warnings, the demand for these vitamin injections continues to grow. Many clinics and beauty spas offer a range of vitamin injections that promise to improve the skin, increase energy, and enhance overall wellness. Vitamin C, vitamin B complex, and glutathione injections are some of the popular types of injections available on the market. Celebrities and businessmen are also some of the key drivers of this trend. They are using these injections to optimize their performance levels and battle fatigue. The demanding work schedules and extensive travel are some of the leading causes of fatigue, and the use of vitamin injections has become a quick and easy way to address this. Moreover, some claim that vitamin injections have significantly improved their conditions without the negative side effects that come with oral use of vitamins. The intravenous method ensures that the body can quickly absorb a high dose of vitamins, leading to the desired results. In conclusion, vitamin injections have become a growing trend in Japan. While they offer benefits such as targeted results, quick absorption, and increased energy levels, users need to be mindful of the risk of overdosing on vitamins. Nutritionists advise that consumers should be aware of the amount of vitamins they are consuming and get advice from a medical professional before using these injections. Regardless, they remain a sought-after health and beauty treatment in Japan.
