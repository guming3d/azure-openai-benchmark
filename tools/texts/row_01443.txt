article: (CNN) -- Dallas Cowboys teammates Josh Brent and Jerry Brown Jr. were "like brothers" and "the best of friends," Brown's mother and grandmother said Monday, showing no ill will toward the man who may be responsible for the loss of their family member. The teammates were involved in a fiery weekend car crash. Brown was killed, and Brent was arrested on suspicion of intoxication manslaughter. He was released from jail Sunday on $500,000 bond. Asked whether she was angry when she heard that alcohol could have been a contributing factor in the crash, Brown's mother, Stacey Jackson, said that she was and that she feels for Brent and his family. "I was upset, but I realize, you know, our youth today are young and stupid. And we was all once that age and we done things that we are not proud of," she said during an interview on CNN's "Piers Morgan Tonight." "I know Josh Brent, and he's been part of our family since Jerry went to the University of Illinois. That's all I can do, is pray for him and his family because I know he's hurting just as well as we are because him and Jerry was like brothers." A Mercedes Brent was driving flipped and caught fire early Saturday in Irving, Texas, the Dallas suburb where the Cowboys are based. Police said the car was traveling at high speed when it hit a curb. "My heart, every part of me aches," Brown's grandmother, Theresa Clark, said on "Piers Morgan Tonight." "That young man, Josh. I pray, I pray for him too because he has feelings and he has a heart. And he loved Jerry. They were the best of friends. I have no ill feelings toward him," she said. "He was a beautiful friend." Brown, 25, was an outside linebacker on the Dallas practice squad. In a statement issued through his agent Saturday night, Brent said he was "devastated" over the accident and "filled with grief for the loss of my close friend and teammate, Jerry Brown." "I am also grief-stricken for his family, friends and all who were blessed enough to have known him. I will live with this horrific and tragic loss every day for the rest of my life," he said. Brent, 24, is in his third season with the Cowboys. The charge he faces is a second-degree felony that carries a potential two- to 20-year prison sentence with a maximum $10,000 fine. Brent pleaded guilty to a DUI charge in 2009, according to court records in Champaign, Illinois, where he played football with Brown at the University of Illinois. He received a 60-day sentence, a fine and 200 hours of community service. CNN's Lateef Mungin, Chandler Friedman and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.

chatgpt: The tragic death of Jerry Brown Jr., an outside linebacker for the Dallas practice squad, is making headlines across the country. Brown died in a weekend car crash, while his teammate, Josh Brent, was arrested on suspicion of intoxication manslaughter. The incident has left many in the NFL community and beyond in shock and mourning. Brown's mother and grandmother appeared on CNN's "Piers Morgan Tonight" to discuss the devastating loss. "My heart, every part of me aches," said Brown's grandmother, who spoke through tears during the interview. "It's a pain that I can't even explain, and I don't want any other mother, father, or grandparent to feel this pain." The details of the crash are still under investigation, but authorities have confirmed that Brent was driving the vehicle and Brown was a passenger when it crashed early Saturday morning in Irving, Texas. Brent was taken into custody on suspicion of intoxication manslaughter, a charge that carries a penalty of up to 20 years in prison. According to police reports, Brent's blood alcohol level was over twice the legal limit at the time of the accident. The two men had reportedly been out together earlier in the evening and had been at a private club in Dallas. Brent, a defensive lineman who had previously played with the Chicago Bears and was a close friend of Brown's, was released from prison on $500,000 bail on Sunday. He appeared in court on Sunday, where prosecutors asked that his bail be increased, given the severity of the charges. Brent's attorney argued that he was not a flight risk and had cooperated fully with authorities. The tragedy has left the Dallas Cowboys organization reeling. Brown had signed with the team in October and was a member of the practice squad. He had previously played college football for the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In a statement, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones expressed his sadness at the loss of Brown. "We are deeply saddened by the news of this accident and the passing of Jerry Brown," he said. "At this time, our hearts and prayers go out to the Brown family, Josh Brent and his family, and all those who knew and loved Jerry." The Cowboys marked Brown's passing with a special tribute during their game against the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday. Players wore a helmet decal honoring Brown, and a moment of silence was observed before the game. The incident has once again brought attention to the issue of drunk driving, which is a leading cause of car accidents and fatalities in the United States. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that drunk driving fatalities accounted for 28% of all traffic-related deaths in the country in 2019. In the wake of the tragedy, the Cowboys have announced plans to work with Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) to raise awareness about the dangers of drunk driving. Jones has pledged to donate a portion of the team's parking proceeds from the Bengals game to the organization. The incident has also raised questions about the responsibility of teammates in situations like these. Many have criticized Brent for driving under the influence with a teammate in the car, and have called on the NFL to take a more proactive role in educating players about the dangers of drunk driving. As the investigation into the crash continues, Brown's family and friends are left to mourn the loss of a young man whose life was cut tragically short. Despite the pain they are feeling, they have spoken out about the need for greater awareness around the issue of drunk driving, in the hope that others may be spared from the same fate.
