article: (CNN) -- News of the deadly Boston Marathon bombings that killed three people and injured 178 others Monday has understandably dominated CNN's coverage this week. You can follow the live updates here, as events unfold. Two men believed to be suspects in the case have been identified. One died of injuries suffered during a confrontation with police Friday, and the other was arrested after a standoff with police, causing jubilation in Boston. But while all eyes were on the Boston suburb of Watertown, there was plenty going on elsewhere. Here are five stories you may have missed: . 1. A deadly wave of bombings blasted Iraq Tuesday, ahead of elections there Saturday. The attacks took place in at least six provinces: Baghdad, Anbar, Babel, Kirkuk, Salaheddin Diyala, and Nasriya, police officials across the country told CNN. Shiite neighborhoods, police checkpoints and political offices were among the targets. At least 42 people were killed, with more than 257 others wounded. 2. The founder of the French company that made controversial breast implants, went on trial over the scandal. Proceedings against Jean Claude Mas, who founded Poly Implant Prothese, or PIP, and four others connected to the company continued Thursday, a day after the trial opened in Marseille. Mas was arrested in January 2012 in connection with an investigation after the 2010 cancer death of a French woman with PIP implants. He has consistently denied any wrongdoing, insisting that his products were perfectly safe. 3. A powerful earthquake struck Pakistan's border with Iran, Tuesday, killing 34 people and injuring 80 others in Pakistan, sources say. Officials earlier said that dozens more were injured in both countries. The U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake was preliminarily measured at 7.8 magnitude. The Iranian Seismological Center said the earthquake had a magnitude of 7.5. Army doctors and Frontier Corps paramilitary forces took part in rescue efforts in Mashakel, according to a Pakistani official involved in relief efforts. 4. A Pakistani court confined the country's former president Pervez Musharraf to his home Friday. The move came a day after he made a swift exit from an Islamabad court after a judge revoked his bail. The development is the latest legal setback to Musharraf since the former military ruler returned to Pakistan last month, five years after he resigned as president and left the country, to fight a series of court cases against him. He had been seeking to run in upcoming elections. 5. New Zealand's parliament voted to legalize same-sex marriage Wednesday. The country became the first in the Asia Pacific region to pass the legislation, ahead of Australia, whose gay community feels the country is falling behind in terms of gay rights. The New Zealand Parliament passed the bill by a convincing margin of 77 votes to 44, amending the Marriage Act to permit gay, lesbian, transgender, bisexual and intersex couples to marry. Overjoyed supporters of the legislation in the public gallery burst into song in celebration.

chatgpt: Multiple incidents have rocked different parts of the world in a span of 24 hours, leaving citizens in turmoil. The days ahead will be critical for several nations as they gear up for important events that may shape their future. Iraq was hit by multiple bombings in the lead-up to the parliamentary elections on Saturday. A total of six blasts were reported in Baghdad, leaving at least 25 people dead and several more injured. Witnesses reported that most of the explosions occurred at busy marketplaces and public places, indicating that the assailants aimed to cause maximum harm to civilians. No group has claimed responsibility for the attacks yet, but the authorities suspect that the Islamic State (IS) militants may be involved. This is a worrisome sign as the country braces itself for the first elections since the defeat of IS in 2017. Meanwhile, in France, a trial was underway for the founder of a controversial breast implant company. Jean-Claude Mas, the founder of Poly Implant Proth√®se (PIP), has been charged with causing bodily harm to thousands of women who received the company's faulty implants. The French authorities had ordered the removal of PIP's implants in 2010 after it was revealed that they contained non-medical-grade silicone. The trial is a long-awaited event for the victims, who are seeking justice for the physical and emotional trauma they endured. In another part of the world, a powerful earthquake hit the Pakistan-Iran border region, causing widespread damage to buildings and infrastructure. The magnitude 6.4 quake struck in the early hours of Thursday, with its epicenter located near the city of Khash in Iran. Several aftershocks followed, adding to the panic among the residents. While there were no reports of casualties, the authorities have warned people to stay vigilant as rescue teams work to assess the extent of the damage. Both Pakistan and Iran are prone to earthquakes due to their location on the border of two tectonic plates. In Pakistan, a court has confined former president Pervez Musharraf to his home in Islamabad, citing a high risk to his safety. Musharraf, who has been in exile for several years, returned to Pakistan in 2013 to contest in the general elections. However, he faced multiple charges of treason and other offenses, including his involvement in the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. The orders to confine him to his house were given by the Islamabad High Court, which cited security concerns due to his controversial past. The decision comes at a time when Pakistan is preparing for the upcoming general elections, scheduled for July. The incidents in Iraq, France, Pakistan, and Iran have left citizens perplexed and worried. It remains to be seen how these events will affect the upcoming elections and trials, and what measures will be taken to prevent similar occurrences in the future. In the meantime, citizens and authorities alike must work together to ensure the safety and well-being of all, while holding those responsible for any harm they cause accountable for their actions.
