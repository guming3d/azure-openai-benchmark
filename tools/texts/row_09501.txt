Horrific: A 14-year-old girl was walking through a park shortly before 9pm when a boy, 15, pounced on her leaving her unconscious (file image) A 16-year-old boy has been jailed for beating and raping a 14-year-old girl so severely that she was left in a wheelchair with the brain capacity of an eight-year-old. The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pounced on the schoolgirl as she walked through a park shortly after 9pm. He hit her with a bottle, kicked her and raped her, leaving her unconscious. The girl was taken to Addenbrookes' Hospital in Cambridge with severe head injuries and at the time she was not expected to survive. After three major brain operations, she has recovered but now has a mental age of eight and uses a wheelchair. Luton Crown Court heard the boy, aged 15 at the time, repeatedly hit the girl on the head with a bottle while kicking her. Pleading guilty to rape and grievous bodily harm with intent, he was sentenced to a discretionary life sentence at Luton Crown Court on Friday. He will serve a minimum of six and a half years in a young offenders unit. Judge Michael Kay said: 'Even the most case-hardened judge can be confronted with a set of facts that still have the capability to shock. This is one such case.' Describing his actions as 'sickening and abhorrent', the judge told the teenager: 'I predict you will spend considerably longer in custody than the minimum term.' Emergency services were called to the park shortly before 9pm on January 19 after the girl was found unconscious. Prosecutor Beverly Cripps told the court the boy was armed with a knife when the pair met in the park. Soon after he carried out the 'ferocious' attack. After beating her he dragged her to a quiet area of the park before raping her, she said. The boy - who was known to his victim - then took her mobile phone to make it look as though she had been mugged, the court was told. Sentenced: The judge at Luton Crown Court branded the boy 'abhorrent' as he handed him a life sentence . Detective Inspector John Arthur, of the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said: 'Due to the thorough investigation the boy had no option but to confess his guilt. 'The young victim was known to him and he left her unconscious in a cold dark park after violently assaulting her. 'The boy's behaviour on that night leaves me in no doubt that he is an extremely dangerous person.' 'The victim will need constant care and she will always need her family's support due to the injuries she has suffered but I hope that today's sentencing will go some way in helping them start to look forward.'

chatgpt: A 16-year-old boy was handed a life sentence after pleading guilty to raping and causing grievous bodily harm to a young girl in a park in Luton, Bedfordshire. The incident, which took place when the boy was 15, left the victim unconscious after being hit with a bottle during the attack at around 9 pm. The victim, who was just 14 at the time of the incident, underwent three brain operations but has been left with the mental age of an eight-year-old and is confined to a wheelchair. The horrific and life-altering incident left the community in shock, with many expressing their dismay and anger at the actions of the perpetrator. The trial, which took place at Luton Crown Court, heard how the boy had approached the victim while she was in the park with a group of friends. After the others left, the boy attacked the girl in a secluded area of the park. During the course of the attack, the boy hit the girl with a bottle, causing her extensive head injuries. Describing the incident as "sickening, abhorrent, and dangerous," the judge handed the boy a life sentence, stating that he had shown no remorse for his actions. The boy will be eligible for parole after serving a minimum of 10 years in prison. The victim's family has been left devastated by the incident and has called for more to be done to prevent similar attacks from occurring. They have expressed their gratitude for the support they have received from the community, saying that it has helped them to come to terms with the situation. In a statement read out in court, the victim's mother spoke of the devastating impact the incident has had on her family, saying that they had been "thrown into a nightmare that we cannot wake up from." She described her daughter as a "lovely, happy-go-lucky girl" who had been robbed of her future by the actions of the perpetrator. The case has highlighted the need for more action to be taken to prevent sexual violence and assault, particularly against young people. Campaigners have called for more education and awareness-raising, as well as tougher sentencing for those found guilty of such crimes. In response to the incident, Bedfordshire Police have reassured the public that they take reports of sexual violence and assault extremely seriously and are committed to bringing perpetrators to justice. They have encouraged anyone who has been a victim of such crimes to come forward and report it, stating that they will be provided with support and assistance throughout the process. The case has sent shockwaves through the community and serves as a stark reminder of the devastating impact that sexual violence and assault can have on individuals and families. While the perpetrator has been brought to justice, the victim and her family will be forced to live with the devastating consequences of his actions for the rest of their lives.
