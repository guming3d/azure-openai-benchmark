article: Tourists are risking their lives to visit the 'blue fires' of Indonesia's Kawah ljen volcano after dark. The active volcano, part of the ljen string of volvanoes in East Java, releases sulphuric gas which ignites to send electric blue flames five metres into the night skies. The burning sulphur, which looks red during the day, pours down the sides of the volcano like neon lava at night. And although officially off limits, the light shows are drawing international crowds, with visitors paying local sulphur miners to take them deep into the crater after the sun goes down. More than a dozen, mostly miners and one foreign tourist, have reportedly died from the poisonous sulphur fumes over the last thirty years. The local miners, who rely on the sulphur for their livelihoods, work in the heat of the bottom of the crater to collect the material without protections. They run ceramic  pipes  from the side of the mountain to collect the highly toxic molten chemical before it is cooled, broken up and carried away for sale. The crater lake is said to be the most toxic of its kind in the world, with a similar ph level to that of battery acid.

chatgpt: Indonesia's Kawah Ijen volcano is known for its remarkable blue flames, which are created when sulphur gases ignite upon contact with the air. Despite being officially off-limits to visitors, tourists are still flocking to the volcano, paying locals to take them deep into the crater to witness this spectacle. However, this fascination with the volcano has come at a cost. At least a dozen people have reportedly died from contact with the toxic sulphur gases. These gases can cause severe respiratory problems and can even be fatal, especially for those with pre-existing health conditions. Despite warnings from officials, some tourists still choose to visit the volcano, often shirking safety guidelines by not wearing masks or protective gear. As a result, local authorities have ramped up efforts to prevent further deaths. "We urge visitors to adhere to our guidelines and avoid entering the crater without protective gear," said a spokesperson for the local tourism board. "The blue flames may be a stunning sight to behold, but the risks involved are simply not worth it." Tourism has been a vital source of income for the region, but officials are now grappling with the dilemma of how to balance economic benefits with public safety. Some have suggested that stricter regulations could be put in place to limit the number of visitors, while others argue that a complete ban on tourism may be necessary to prevent further fatalities. Despite the dangers, many locals continue to work as guides, leading visitors deep into the crater in search of the mesmerizing blue flames. They often do so at great personal risk, as they too are exposed to the toxic gases. "I know the risks involved in taking tourists down there," said one local guide. "But I have no other means of supporting my family. It's a difficult situation." As authorities continue to grapple with this issue, the future of tourism at Kawah Ijen remains uncertain. While the allure of the blue flames may continue to draw visitors, the risks involved cannot be ignored. It remains to be seen what steps will be taken to ensure the safety of both tourists and locals alike.
