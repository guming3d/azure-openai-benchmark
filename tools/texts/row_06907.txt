chatgpt: A mysterious high-pitched “choral sound” was first heard during the time of Hurricane Sandy and has been baffling scientists ever since. The eerie noise was picked up by seismometers and infrasound detectors located all over the planet. The sound was described as a harmonious, continuous tone with a frequency of about 2.5 Hz, which is far below the range of human hearing. Research has shown that the sound was created by the ocean itself and not by any man-made or natural source. The strange noise was heard for the first time on November 17, 2012, in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, one of the most destructive storms to ever hit the northeastern United States. Despite Sandy being downgraded to a tropical storm by the time it reached New York, the massive storm still caused widespread destruction and flooding. Scientists have been studying the phenomenon ever since, and have come up with several theories to explain the strange noise. Some researchers think the sound is related to the underwater landslide caused by the storm, while others believe it could be the result of an atmospheric coupling, in which the storm's powerful winds interact with the sea surface. However, another study conducted by the US Pacific Tsunami Warning Center suggests that the sound could be related to a phenomenon known as the "microbarom." Microbaroms are low-frequency sound waves that are created by the movement of ocean waves during a storm. They can travel great distances and are capable of being recorded by seismometers and infrasound detectors. Despite years of research, the exact cause of the sound remains a mystery. Some have even speculated that the sound could be an ominous warning of a natural disaster yet to come. While scientists continue to investigate, the strange, haunting noise continues to be heard around the world during major storms and hurricanes. It remains a curious and mysterious phenomenon that still captures the imagination of people everywhere.
