article: By . Harriet Hernando . If you’ve ever marvelled at the wonder of hand warmers – those hard flat packs that heat up when you bend them - then this video will amaze you. A scientist from the University of Toronto, Canada, is filmed putting his hand in a jar of hot ice, or molten sodium acetate, so it crystallises around his fingers. In a matter of seconds, the man's fingers are coated in a thick layer of ice. But instead of being cold, the scientist explains that his hand is actually quite warm, ‘like a hot bath’. Frozen: The scientist's hands are coated in a thick layer of hot ice, or molten sodium acetate. Because the ice is in fact warm, he is able to shake the crystals off . ‘Hot ice’ is created using sodium acetate, which is a salt created from the reaction between sodium bicarbonate, or baking soda, and acetic acid, or vinegar. When this reaction occurs, sodium acetate appears to freeze like ‘ice’ as the cold solution turns from liquid to solid. This process is exothermic, meaning that the solid structure is warm to the touch. Solutions of sodium acetate are used in certain types of hand-warmers. When a metal button is pressed inside the plastic pouch containing the solution, it releases chemicals that starts the reaction. This causes the solution to crystallise, and this reaction generates heat. Eventually he’s left with a block of ice stuck to his hand, but he’s able to break free because the crystals are still soft, ‘like ice cream’. Explaining the process on YouTube channel NurdRage, the scientist, who does not give his name, said: ‘This works because the substance is not "ice" as in water, but a different substance called sodium acetate trihydrate. ‘Normally solid sodium acetate was melted into a liquid that was then supercooled to below its melting point. ‘In this state, adding nucleation sites, like the crystals on my hand, rapidly causes the rest of the sodium acetate to crystallise.’ The incredible video has been watched almost three million times. ‘Hot ice’ is created using sodium acetate, which is a salt created from the reaction between sodium bicarbonate, or baking soda, and acetic acid, or vinegar.

chatgpt: A scientist from the University of Toronto made headlines this week after placing his hand in a unique substance known as "hot ice." The substance, made from molten sodium acetate during an exothermic reaction, quickly solidifies into a thick layer resembling ice. However, unlike regular ice, this substance is warm, with the scientist describing it as feeling "like a hot bath." The striking experiment was conducted to showcase the properties of hot ice, which has a range of potential applications. Perhaps most commonly, molten sodium acetate is used in plastic hand warmers that can provide warmth for hours without the need for electricity or external heat sources. Despite its practical uses, hot ice has a fascinating backstory rooted in its unusual chemical properties. The sodium acetate used to make hot ice is an ionic compound, meaning it is composed of positively and negatively charged ions. When the compound is molten, the ions are free to move around and interact, creating a highly reactive environment. During the exothermic process of the hot ice reaction, the sodium acetate molecules release energy in the form of heat, which quickly causes the liquid to solidify into a crystalline structure. As the reaction continues, the heat is released in even greater quantities, raising the temperature of the solid hot ice to a comfortable, albeit warm, level. To demonstrate the unique properties of hot ice, the scientist placed his hand directly into the substance. Within seconds, his hand was completely covered by the thick layer of hot ice, providing a stunning visual display of the substance's solidifying properties. Despite the seemingly dangerous nature of the experiment, the scientist was not in any danger. As the hot ice is warm to the touch, he was able to easily remove his hand from the solidified substance without experiencing any discomfort or burns. The practical applications of hot ice extend beyond plastic hand warmers, with potential uses in medical, industrial, and aerospace settings. In medical environments, hot ice could potentially be used as a method for reducing inflammation or pain without the need for traditional cooling methods such as ice packs. In industrial settings, hot ice could be used to control the temperature of machinery or other equipment, preventing overheating or other potential malfunctions. Additionally, hot ice could be utilized in space exploration, where traditional methods of heating and cooling may not be feasible. In recent years, research into hot ice and its potential applications has increased dramatically, with scientists and researchers around the globe exploring the substance's complex chemical properties. Despite its relatively recent discovery, hot ice has quickly become a fascinating area of study, with its unique solidifying and warming properties creating opportunities for potential breakthroughs in a range of fields. As researchers continue to uncover the secrets of this remarkable substance, there is little doubt that hot ice will play a critical role in shaping the future of science and technology.
