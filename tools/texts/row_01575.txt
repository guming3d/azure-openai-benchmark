Captain Steve Smith led the charge once again, remaining unbeaten on 72 at stumps. Smith's performance continued his impressive form in the series. He scored a brilliant 162 in the first test in Adelaide and followed it up with a fantastic knock of 133 in Brisbane. His contributions have been instrumental in Australia taking a 2-0 lead in the series. Australia looked confident and impressive in Melbourne, with Smith leading from the front. However, India had a glimpse of hope when Australia were 216 for five. But Smith and Brad Haddin took control of the proceedings and pulled away from the visitors to end the day on a high. Smith's knock of 72 not out off 167 deliveries included nine boundaries. He shared a crucial unbeaten partnership of 43 runs with Haddin, who remained unbeaten on 23 off 58 balls by the end of the day's play. Apart from Smith and Haddin, opener Dave Warner was the only other batsman to make a significant contribution to the Australian total. He scored 65 off 79 balls before being dismissed by spinner Ravindra Jadeja. For India, the pacers, Ishant Sharma and Mohammed Shami, picked up two wickets each, while Jadeja dismissed Warner and Shaun Marsh. Captain Virat Kohli also contributed with his part-time spin and claimed the wicket of Mitchell Marsh. India would be disappointed with their performance as they had a chance to put some pressure on the Australian team. However, they failed to capitalize on the opportunity and allowed Smith and Haddin to take control of the proceedings. With Australia in a commanding position, there is a real chance that they could wrap up the series with another win in Melbourne. However, India would be hoping to make a comeback and prevent a whitewash by putting up a strong performance in the remaining days of the Test match. Overall, it was a dominant display by Australia on the first day of the third Test. Smith once again proved his worth as a captain and a batsman and will be looking to continue his impressive run of form in the remaining days of the match.
