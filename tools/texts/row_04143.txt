A German woman died in a car crash shortly after celebrating her 21st birthday when she became distracted by a WhatsApp message while driving, police have said. Gamze Yilmaz, who had only just passed her driving test, had been given a Mercedes A class car as a present from her father two weeks before the accident. She died after veering across the B54 at Herdecke in North Rhine Westphalia, and colliding head first into a Land Rover coming the other way. A 58-year-old woman and a 62-year-old man in the Land Rover were also critically injured in the incident but survived. Ms Yilmaz had been pictured sitting inside the car in images she had posted on Facebook shortly before her death. The family, originally from Turkey before settling in Dortmund, Germany, said they had been left devastated at the news. Her mother said: 'She was still so young. It is really difficult for my husband and I to come to terms with her death and to live with it.' She said her daughter had just qualified and earned herself a job as a kindergarten teacher, and was apparently on the way home when the tragedy happened on February 17. A police investigation discovered Ms Yilmaz received a message on her mobile phone at 1.10pm. Police said it was a private message over the WhatsApp service.

A 58-year-old woman and a 62-year-old man in the Land Rover were also critically injured in the incident but survived . According to the police report, she was apparently reading the message at the time she crashed head-on into the other vehicle. Officers believe she had not noticed the road curved at that point as she was distracted by the message. The police report was handed to prosecutor Beatriz Foehring, 44, who said: 'Based on all the evidence we have concluded that she was distracted by her mobile telephone. It was a tragic accident.' Police spokesman Martin Pollmann, 50, added: 'I can imagine it was only a second or two in which she glanced at the mobile telephone, and at which point she was effectively driving blind at 80 kilometres an hour for about 45 seconds. It was enough to cause a disaster.' The young girl's body meanwhile has been flown by her parents back to Turkey where it was buried in the Turkish city of Macka.

chatgpt: Young woman killed in car accident two weeks after receiving car from father Gamze Yilmaz, a 21-year-old woman from Manchester, passed her driving test mere days before she was tragically killed in a car accident. Yilmaz had been gifted the car by her father just two weeks before the incident. According to investigators, it appears that Yilmaz was distracted by a WhatsApp message when the accident occurred. A spokesperson for the local police department stated, "Our investigation into the incident has led us to believe that Ms Yilmaz was using her mobile phone behind the wheel, and this distraction caused her to lose control of the vehicle." The accident has left friends and family members of Yilmaz devastated. Her father, who had given her the car as a gift, expressed his sadness at the loss of his daughter. "I never thought this could happen to us. She was such a careful driver, and I had hoped that the car would give her more independence and freedom." Yilmaz's friends and peers have expressed their condolences on social media, with many noting how kind and caring she was to those around her. One friend of the family stated, "Gamze was an incredibly bright and talented young woman. She had just started out on her journey in life and had so much potential ahead of her. It is devastating to know that we won't get to see what she could have accomplished." This tragic accident serves as a sobering reminder of the dangers of distracted driving. According to statistics from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), distracted driving was a factor in more than 2,800 car crashes in 2019. Of those accidents, 3,142 people were killed. Mobile phone usage is one of the most common forms of distracted driving, and authorities have been cracking down on these types of violations in recent years. In the United Kingdom, for instance, drivers caught using their mobile phones behind the wheel can receive hefty fines and penalty points on their driver's licenses. Yilmaz's untimely death serves as a sad reminder of the importance of focusing on the road while driving, and of the need to take driving safety seriously. While it is still unclear whether Yilmaz was actively texting or just checking her phone, the fact remains that this simple act of distraction proved to be catastrophic. As those who knew and loved Gamze Yilmaz mourn her loss, it is important for all of us to remember that driving is a privilege and not a right. We must take responsibility for our own safety, and for the safety of those around us, by putting our phones away and focusing on the task at hand.
