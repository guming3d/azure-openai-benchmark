article: (CNN) -- New Jersey and Delaware look set for a blizzard starting Friday afternoon, and Washington and Baltimore, Maryland, may experience "near-blizzard conditions" starting Friday, the National Weather Service said Thursday. The blizzard warning for New Jersey and Delaware takes effect Friday at 4 p.m., while the winter storm warning for the nation's capital and surrounding areas starts Friday morning at 10 a.m. The expected New Jersey blizzard will make travel "extremely dangerous," the agency cautioned. The warning means "severe winter conditions are expected," while snow, strong winds and poor visibility are likely, leading to "whiteout conditions." The storm could drop up to 24 inches of snow on southern New Jersey and 12 to 18 inches on Delaware and the central New Jersey coast, the National Weather Service in Mount Holly, New Jersey, said. The blizzard warning remains in effect until Saturday at 7 p.m. It replaces an earlier winter storm watch, which is less severe. Washington and Baltimore will be under a winter storm warning from 10 a.m. Friday until 10 p.m. Saturday. The winter storm warning is issued when significant amounts of snow are expected or occurring. The storm will make travel "very hazardous or nearly impossible Friday night," the agency warned. Amtrak has canceled most Friday service from Washington southward, it said Thursday. Washington schools will dismiss students at 12 p.m. Friday and cancel all after-school programs, the school system announced Thursday night. Baltimore, Maryland, Washington and the surrounding north Virginia area could receive 16 to 24 inches of snow, with Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, getting eight to 12 inches. Winter storm warnings also cover most of Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, central Indiana, Ohio and western North Carolina. iReport: Share your photos and video with CNN . New York residents could face 4 to 9 inches of snow between Friday and Saturday, the weather service said, but there is a chance the storm system will remain south of the city. In the Southeast, heavy rain Thursday will cause widespread minor flooding and isolated moderate flooding across the region, forecasters said. Flood watches are in effect for southeastern Louisiana, to east-central Georgia, with western South Carolina and eastern North Carolina also affected.

chatgpt: Multiple weather warnings have been issued across the East Coast, with Delaware and New Jersey facing blizzard conditions. The National Weather Service has stated that the latter state could potentially see as much as two feet of snow, with extreme "whiteout" conditions predicted for large portions of the area. Snowfall levels of this magnitude have prompted officials to warn residents to exercise caution and remain indoors. In weather conditions such as these, it is easy for roads to become dangerous or even impassable, and power outages can affect large swaths of the affected regions. In Maryland, "near-blizzard conditions" are expected in both Washington and Baltimore, with winds predicted to reach up to 60 miles per hour. While snowfall is expected to be slightly less severe than in New Jersey, travel in these areas will still be dangerous, and residents are warned to remain vigilant. Meanwhile, the Southeast region of the United States is facing its own set of severe weather events. Heavy rainfall and flooding are predicted in several states, including Georgia, Alabama, and the Carolinas. Officials are urging residents to take proactive measures, such as preparing sandbags and moving to higher ground, in order to protect their homes and families. With multiple weather warnings and alerts issued across the East Coast, it is crucial that residents stay informed and heed official guidance. The National Weather Service and local officials are continuously monitoring the situation and providing updates to ensure public safety. This weather system is the latest in a series of extreme weather events that have impacted the United States over the past several months. From wildfires and heatwaves in California to hurricanes in the Gulf Coast, 2020 has already seen far more than its fair share of natural disasters. As the East Coast prepares for this latest weather event, residents are reminded to take necessary precautions and stay safe. While the situation is certainly challenging, officials remain hopeful that with proper preparation and response, the effects of this storm can be mitigated.
