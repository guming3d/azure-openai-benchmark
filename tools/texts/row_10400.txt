chatgpt: Harrison Town Justice Marc Lust is facing multiple charges including driving while intoxicated after being arrested in midtown Manhattan on December 19. According to police reports, Lust told police officers that he was a judge and that he would "take care of this." Lust, who was described as unsteady and slurring his words, allegedly admitted to having had three drinks at a Christmas party. However, he denied that he had been driving under the influence of alcohol. Despite his protests, Lust failed a field sobriety test and was taken into custody. Lust has been charged with driving while intoxicated, obstructing governmental administration and driving while ability impaired, according to court documents. He was released on his own recognizance after his arraignment in Manhattan Criminal Court on December 20. The arrest has raised concerns about the ethical implications of a judge being charged with driving under the influence. Some legal experts have questioned whether Lust can continue to serve as a judge while facing these charges. According to the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct, judges are expected to "respect and comply with the law, including traffic laws." The commission also notes that judges should not "abuse the power or prestige of judicial office to intimidate or influence others." Despite the charges, Lust has indicated that he plans to continue serving as a town justice in Harrison. In a statement to local media, Lust apologized for his actions and stated that he would be taking steps to address any personal issues related to alcohol. "My behavior on Wednesday night was completely unacceptable and I take full responsibility for my actions," Lust said. "I understand that as a judge, I am held to a higher standard and I have let my community and my colleagues down. I will be seeking counseling and treatment to address any personal issues related to alcohol." It remains unclear how the arrest will impact Lust's standing as a judge in Harrison. However, legal experts have noted that judges who are charged with crimes are often placed on leave while their cases are adjudicated.  The case is set to proceed in Manhattan Criminal Court in the coming weeks. Lust is expected to plead not guilty to the charges against him.
