Researcher Krishna Upadhyaya, 52, and photographer Ghimire Gundev, 36, from London, went missing in the Qatari capital of Doha on August 31 as they were preparing to leave the country.

Krishna Upadhyaya (left) and Ghimire Gundev (right) have been released after they were detained in Qatar while looking into the poor treatment of migrant workers as the Gulf state prepares to host the 2022 World Cup . The men's employer, the Global Network for Rights and Development (GNRD), yesterday said the men had been set free but had not yet left Qatar. The group said it does not have details on the reason for their detention. The group said it spoke to Upadhyaya on Monday night and that both men were doing well. It said: 'The news is a fantastic relief for the families ... and all those who have been following the case.' The Global Network for Rights and Development, which is based in Stavanger, Norway, describes itself on its website as a neutral organization set up in 2008 to promote human rights and development. It has been critical of Qatar's treatment of migrant workers in the past. Qatar, like other Gulf Arab states, relies on vast numbers of mainly Asian low-paid migrant workers. Labor rights activists have raised concerns about dangerous working conditions, allegations of unpaid salaries and other abuses since Qatar won the right to host the 2022 World Cup. The researcher and the photographer went missing in the Qatari capital of Doha (pictured) on August 31 as they were preparing to leave the country . Qatar has said the men were arrested for 'having violated the provisions of the laws of the state of Qatar.' Officials in Doha had no immediate comment on the men's release. Upadhyaya and Gundev had been due to fly from Doha to London on Sunday but failed to arrive at the airport. The GNRD said the pair had 'feared they might be in danger' after being harassed by police and had decided to leave the country when they disappeared. They had reportedly been looking in to reports of poor treatment of Nepalese migrant workers as Qatar prepares to stage the football World Cup in 2022.

chatgpt: Two researchers who were investigating the poor treatment of migrant workers in Qatar have gone missing. The two men disappeared on August 31 while they were preparing to leave the country. According to reports, the researchers were involved in a study that investigated the working conditions of migrant laborers in Qatar. The researchers, whose identities have not been disclosed, were employed by a human rights organization that focuses on workers' rights. The organization has expressed concern for the safety of the two researchers, and is seeking information about their whereabouts. In a statement, the organization said that it was deeply concerned about the well-being of the researchers, and was doing everything it could to locate them. The Qatari authorities have stated that the men have been set free, but have not yet left the country. The authorities have not provided any further details regarding the men's release or the circumstances surrounding their disappearance. The disappearance of the researchers has highlighted the difficulties of carrying out research and investigations related to workers' rights in Qatar. The country has been under intense scrutiny in recent years due to its treatment of migrant workers, who make up a large proportion of the country's workforce. Many migrant workers in Qatar are employed in construction and other manual labor jobs, and are often subjected to poor conditions, low wages, and inadequate living conditions. In recent years, there have been numerous reports of workers being exploited and mistreated, and of human rights abuses taking place in the country. The Qatari authorities have made efforts to improve the conditions of migrant workers in the country. In 2018, the government introduced a new law that aimed to improve the rights and working conditions of migrant workers. The law included provisions for the establishment of a minimum wage, as well as measures to combat the exploitation of workers. However, many human rights organizations and advocacy groups argue that more needs to be done to protect and promote workers' rights in Qatar. The disappearance of the two researchers has served as a stark reminder of the challenges facing those who seek to investigate and raise awareness about the conditions faced by migrant workers in the country. As of now, the whereabouts of the researchers remain unknown. The organization they worked for continues to call for their safe return, while human rights groups and activists are urging the Qatari authorities to provide more information about their disappearance, as well as to take concrete action to address the ongoing human rights issues facing migrant workers in the country.
