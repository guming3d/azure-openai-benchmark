article: A Florida man who allegedly beat to death his girlfriend's son after the child made a mess in his pants has been arrested and charged with premeditated murder. Corey Gordon, 28, was found by Broward Sheriff's Office SWAT unit in Fort Lauderdale on Tuesday, a day after three-year-old Khyese Anthony Coach was taken to hospital by his mother. The little boy was already dead. The mom, Chantel Haye, 20, told The Orlando Sun-Sentinel that she had left Khyese with Gordon while she started a new job. Premeditated murder: Corey Gordon, 28, has been charged with the murder of his girlfriend's three-year-old son, who is believed to have been beaten to death . Killed: Little Khyese had just celebrated his third birthday on Saturday. He died on Monday . Haye and Gordon had been dating for one year. Gordon picked up Haye and her son around 5:30 am from the apartment they share with Haye's mother, sister and nephew. Gordon dropped Haye at work and then took the child to his home in North Lauderdale, which he shares with his sister. During her morning break, Haye called Gordon, who was furious that Khyese's soiled diaper had leaked on his sister's furniture. The two did not talk again until 3:45 pm, when Gordon picked her up from work. 'There were tears in his eyes,' Haye told The Sun-Sentinel. Haye asked Gordon what was wrong but he didn't answer her, so she got into the car. Khyese was on the backseat and Haye initially thought he was sleeping. 'But when I looked more closely at him I saw bruises on his face, his temples, his nose,' Haye said. 'I kept saying, 'What happened to his face?'' Gordon told her the boy was sleeping and had thrown up, and that he thought the boy was sick, Haye said. She got into the backseat to check on him, and realized Kyese was not buckled in and was cold. Murdered: Khyese's mother said her son had marks all over his body and was cold . 'His arm was stiff — it was so unreal,' she said. 'I thought it would break.' Panicking, Haye told Gordon they needed to go to hospital, but Gordon was driving slowly and wouldn't go any faster. Haye said Gordon told her that he he was 'going to jail'. When they finally got to Broward Health Coral Springs, Haye ran inside with Khyese, but Gordon drove away. Nurses saw the toddler and called a code blue, signifying cardiac arrest, Haye said. A short time later a doctor came to tell Haye that Khyese was dead and had been for at least three hours. 'I was in denial,' Haye said. 'I didn't know he was fully gone.' Gordon was booked into Broward's Main Jail around 2 am Wednesday on a charge of premeditated murder.

chatgpt: In a shocking turn of events, 28-year-old Corey Gordon has been charged with premeditated murder after Khyese Anthony Coach, a 3-year-old child, was pronounced dead in hospital on Monday. Gordon had been babysitting the toddler when the incident took place. According to Chantel Haye, a 20-year-old acquaintance of Gordon, he had become angry over a soiled diaper. Haye claims that Gordon had picked her up from work with Khyese already dead in the car. She added that her son had marks all over his body and was cold to the touch. The incident has left the community in shock as they try to come to terms with the tragic loss of such a young life. The investigation is ongoing, but the signs of premeditation suggest that this was not a spur-of-the-moment act of violence. As we mourn the loss of another innocent child to senseless violence, questions are being raised about the safety of children in the care of others. How can we prevent a situation like this from happening again? One possible solution is to implement stricter background checks on individuals who are hired to care for children. It is essential to ensure that those entrusted with a child's safety have no history of violence or abuse. Parents should also be encouraged to ask for references and take the time to get to know their child's caregiver before leaving them in their care. Another vital step is to educate parents on the signs of abuse so they can recognize when their child is not being treated properly. It's not just physical abuse that leaves marks, but also emotional and psychological abuse, which can be much harder to detect. Parents should be encouraged to report any signs of abuse to authorities immediately and take appropriate steps to protect their child. In the meantime, communities must come together to support each other during this difficult time. The loss of a child is never easy to bear, and we must stand together in solidarity as we mourn the tragic loss of Khyese Anthony Coach. Our hearts go out to his family, friends, and everyone affected by this tragedy.
