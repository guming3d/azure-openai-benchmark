A new Microsoft ad has taken a direct jab at Apple, the latest salvo in the tense tablet war between the two tech giants. Turning up the snark, the 30-second ad features a side-by-side comparison of the two computers, an iPad on the left and the Microsoft Windows 8 tablet on the right. The commercial features Apple’s Siri, the voice recognition software that Apple first unveiled in the iPhone 4S in 2011. Two for one: Microsoft tries in the ad to hammer home the point that iPad's cannot display to apps on the screen at once . 'Sorry, I don't update like that,' the voice says in Siri's signature tone as the Windows 8 tablet displays a video and email at the same time. The voice continues: 'I'm sorry, I can only do one thing at a time.' 'I guess PowerPoint isn't one of those things,' the mock Siri adds, hammering home the fact that Apple devices don't feature Microsoft apps. Apparently giving up, 'Siri' asks: 'Should we just play chopsticks?' - an apparent dig at the iPad commercial . where a user plays the song on the iPad's Garage Band app in a past iPad ad.

Getting personal: Apparently giving up, the mock Siri asks: 'Should we just play chopsticks?' - an apparent dig at the iPad commercial where a user plays the song on the iPad's Garage Band app in a past iPad ad . The ad then makes its final argument with a price comparison - $699 for the 64 GB iPad and $449 for the Windows 8 tablet. Despite Microsoft's argument, Apple does not appear to be losing ground in the tablet wars, as the Windows 8 tablet received less-than-stellar reviews and has so far failed to measure up to the hype and sales of the similar Apple and Google devices. Critics, as well as some consumers, lambasted the technology giant over Windows 8, mentioning the confusing array of touchscreen tiles and lack of Microsoft's trademark 'Start' button. While Microsoft has experienced growth in recent years, any success is eclipsed by Apple, which unveiled the iPad Mini at about the same time as Windows 8. Let's talk price: At the conclusion of the ad, Microsoft delivers a price comparison - $250 less than the 64GB iPad . Some reviewers liked the way Windows 8 greets users with a mosaic of tiles displaying applications instead of relying on the desktop icons that served as the welcome mat for years. But others say it's a confusing jumble that will frustrate users accustomed to the older versions, particularly when they switch to desktop mode and don't see the familiar 'start' button and menu. Struck by the flurry of complaints, Microsoft announced earlier this month that it was giving Windows 8 a makeover, known as Windows Blue.

chatgpt: Microsoft has just released a thirty-second commercial as part of its Windows 8 campaign, highlighting the differences between Microsoft's Surface tablet and Apple's iPad. The commercial features a side-by-side comparison of the two devices, with a focus on the iPad's inability to display two apps at once. The commercial opens with a shot of the two tablets side-by-side. The narrator then points out that the iPad cannot display two apps at the same time. A split-screen image is then shown, with the iPad on one side and the Surface on the other. The iPad shows a single app, while the Surface displays two – one on the left and one on the right. The narrator then draws attention to the fact that the Surface's ability to display two apps at once is a result of Windows 8's "snap" feature. This feature allows users to "snap" one app to the side of the screen while running another app in the larger, main part of the screen. The commercial uses Siri, Apple's signature voice recognition software, to hammer home its points. The narrator first asks Siri to show him a movie, only to be told that Siri cannot multitask. The Surface is then shown displaying a movie on one side of the screen and a browser on the other, making the point that Windows 8's multitasking capabilities are far superior to those of the iPad. The narrator then asks Siri to play music and email at the same time. Once again, Siri is unable to do so, while the Surface is shown displaying both apps side-by-side. The commercial ends with the narrator pointing out that, unlike the iPad, the Surface has a detachable keyboard, making it the ideal device for both work and play. While some may argue that the commercial is overly critical of the iPad, Microsoft has consistently positioned the Surface as a device for productivity rather than entertainment. By highlighting the Surface's ability to display two apps at once, Microsoft is targeting business users who require a high degree of multitasking capabilities from their devices. The commercial also draws attention to the fact that Microsoft sees the Surface as a real alternative to the iPad for tablet users. The inclusion of Siri in the commercial is a reminder that while Apple may have led the way in voice recognition technology, Microsoft is making strides in this area as well. Overall, the commercial is a well-crafted piece of advertising that effectively highlights the differences between the Surface and the iPad. It emphasizes the strengths of the Surface while drawing attention to what Microsoft sees as the iPad's limitations. Whether it will be enough to convince consumers to choose the Surface over the iPad remains to be seen, but it is clear that Microsoft is committed to promoting the Surface as a serious contender in the tablet market.
