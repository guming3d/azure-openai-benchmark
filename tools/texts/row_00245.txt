article: Taxpayers paid more than £3,000 for every badger killed in last year’s cull. Official figures revealed the final cost to the public purse of the cull was £6.3 million - with some 1,879 badgers killed. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural affairs revealed the figures last night. Official figures reveal the final cost to the public of the cull was £6.3 million - with 1,879 badgers killed . The Government could have faced estimated costs of £100 million a year if the cull, designed to protect farms from the spread of tuberculosis among cattle, had not taken place. A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the price of the cull was due to rigorous safety rules and the humane methods used by its marksmen. Overall, the programme was said to have cost £6,294,000 to kill 955 badgers in Somerset and 924 in Gloucestershire – meaning it cost around £3,350 per badger. Around £2.6 million was spent monitoring ‘humaneness’ and £2.3 million on ‘efficiency’. Brian May, the Queen guitarist,  joined a rally against the badger cull when it was first proposed in 2012 -  the Badger Trust lost its Court of Appeal challenge to government proposals to kill wild badgers in England . A test cull began last year in the West of England, and was later extended when marksmen missed their targets. The Government has already approved a second cull for this year. However, Labour told the Daily Telegraph that last year’s attempt to reduce the spread of TB had come at a ‘huge cost to the taxpayer’ with little effect. A Defra spokesman said: 'England has the highest incidence of bovine TB in Europe. The cost of the badger culls need to be seen in the context of the devastating scale of the threat bovine TB poses to our farming industry and food security - £500million over the last decade. Doing nothing is not an option. 'We are pursuing a comprehensive strategy, including tighter cattle movement controls, badger vaccination and culling. 'Many of the costs associated with the pilot culls last year were one-offs and have not been repeated this year.'

chatgpt: Official figures from the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA) have revealed that 1,879 badgers were killed in the most recent cull to control the spread of bovine tuberculosis (TB). The cull, which took place across 30 areas in the UK, is part of the government's strategy to protect farms from this highly infectious disease.  Without the cull, it is estimated that the farming industry could have faced costs of up to £100 million annually due to the spread of TB. This would have had a serious impact on the industry, where controlling the spread of disease is a high priority to maintain the health and safety of livestock.  The cull, however, has come at a price. Rigorous safety rules, as well as marksmen's humane methods, have contributed to the cost. Critics of the cull argue that the price paid is too high and have called for alternative methods of controlling the spread of TB to be explored.  The cull, which began in 2013, has remained highly controversial. It has been met with strong opposition from animal rights campaigners who argue that killing badgers in this way is inhumane and ineffective. However, DEFRA's spokesperson has defended the cull stating that it is part of a "comprehensive strategy" to control the spread of TB, alongside strict cattle testing and movement controls.  While badgers are known to be carriers of TB, there is still much debate as to whether the cull is a justifiable and effective method of disease control. Despite the badger population being reduced in the affected areas, TB infection rates in cattle have continued to rise.  In response to this, DEFRA has stated that they will continue to review the effectiveness and humaneness of the cull, as part of their wider strategy to control the spread of TB. The department has also stated that they are exploring new technologies and approaches to disease control in farming, including vaccination programs for badgers and cattle.  While the cull remains controversial, DEFRA's spokesperson emphasized how crucial it is for the farming industry to be protected from the devastating impact of TB. They stated that measures such as the cull are necessary to maintain the health of the livestock and the viability of the industry.  The debate on the methods to control the spread of TB is likely to continue. However, with the DEFRA figures revealing that just under 2,000 badgers were killed in the most recent cull, it is clear that the government remains committed to its strategy. It remains to be seen whether alternative methods, such as vaccination programs, will prove to be a more effective approach to disease control in the long term.
