A chimpanzee who used American Sign Language to communicate as the second youngest member of a family of chimps in Washington has unexpectedly died at the age of 36. Dar was one of three signing chimps at Central Washington University after first learning to sign at infancy among both humans and chimps at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico. Dar - whose full name is Dar es Salaam for the capital of Tanzania - died of unknown causes on Saturday morning. Tragic loss: Dar, pictured above, lived among two other chimpanzees at Central Washington University before his unexpected death on Saturday morning . Early learning: Dar, seen as an infant, was just several months old when he first started learning how to sign . An autopsy is planned for the coming days. 'Dar signed throughout his life, teaching . us about friendships between humans and nonhumans and the minds of . chimpanzees,' said Dr Mary Lee Jensvold, who directs the Chimpanzee and . Human Communication Institute. 'He will be dearly missed.' The average lifespan for chimpanzees is 40 to 45 years though they can live considerably longer in captivity. Remarkably doubling this expectancy, last December Cheetah, the chimpanzee who famously starred in the Tarzan films, died at the age of 80. Remaining at the institute is Loulis, two years older than Dar, who was the first non-human primate to learn a human language from his mother, Washoe, who died in 2007. Loulis, adopted by Washoe in 1979 after . she tragically lost her own infant, was given a unique signal by his . mother for his name, which is the adaption of the signal that means . ‘bug,’ according to the institute. Family: Loulis and Dar are seen embracing during one of Dar's birthday parties, a day that was annually reminded by Tatu by signaling 'ice cream Dar' Dar also leaves behind Tatu, described by the institute as being the most articulate signer of their chimpanzees. He annually reminds his keepers of such holidays of Christmas – ‘sweet tree’ - Thanksgiving – ‘bird meat’ - and even Dar’s birthday in August – ‘ice cream Dar,’ loving dairy foods even though he is lactose intolerant. Tatu will turn 37 this December. Fun and games: In a favourite game of follow the leader, Tatu is seen leading Loulis while carrying bread in her mouth .

chatgpt: Dar, a female chimpanzee, has passed away. She was a resident of the Chimpanzee and Human Communication Institute at Central Washington University, one of the largest institutions in the world that houses chimpanzees. Dar, who was estimated to be in her mid-fifties, passed away on Tuesday. She had been living at the institute for over 30 years, where she was known for her intelligence and her ability to use American Sign Language to communicate with her handlers. Her passing has left behind her two chimpanzee companions, Loulis and Tatu, who are 34 and 36 years old respectively. The average lifespan of chimpanzees is between 40 and 45 years, which means that both Loulis and Tatu are now considered to be elderly chimpanzees. Dar, Loulis, and Tatu shared a unique bond that was built over decades of close proximity and communication with one another. Dar introduced both Loulis and Tatu to sign language, and they learned from her how to communicate with humans. The Chimpanzee and Human Communication Institute at Central Washington University is dedicated to understanding the cognitive and communicative abilities of chimpanzees, and how they compare to those of humans. The institute's research includes studies on the evolution and development of sign language, as well as the social and cognitive abilities of chimpanzees. The loss of Dar is not only felt by Loulis and Tatu, but also by the researchers and staff at the Chimpanzee and Human Communication Institute. Dar was an important member of the institute and her contributions to the understanding of chimpanzee communication will not be forgotten. The institute has released a statement mourning the loss of Dar and expressing their gratitude for her contributions to the study of chimpanzee communication. The statement also emphasized the importance of continuing their important work and honoring Dar's memory. Dar's legacy will continue through the research and education at the Chimpanzee and Human Communication Institute. Loulis and Tatu will be cared for by the institute's staff and continue to be observed and studied for years to come. The passing of Dar is a reminder of the importance of understanding and protecting endangered species such as chimpanzees. While Dar may no longer be with us, her contributions to the field of communication and the importance of preserving the biodiversity of our planet will live on.
