article: By . Chris Paine . Childhood diabetes has spiraled out of control and experts fear it might be years until they catch up on just how rapidly the problem is spreading. New figures show instances of Type-2 diabetes in children and teenagers spiked a drastic 30 per cent between 2000 and 2009, and there are fears the problem has gotten a lot worse in the untracked period in the five years since. The complications arising from diabetes means those children affected face 'a lifetime burden', the study's author warned. Obesity is typically associated with childhood diabetes - which carries associated health risks such as heart attacks and organ failure . Experts fear the problem may have gotten even worse in the five years since the latest figures were tracked . New figures released today show that 0.46 in every 1,000 kids is affected by Type-2 - with more than 20,000 sufferers across the U.S. - while the cases of Type-1 diabetes is up 21 per cent to 167,000 children. The research was presented at a Pediatric Academic Societies conference in Vancouver by Dana Dabelea, from the Colorado School of Public Health in Aurora, who authored the study. 'These increases are serious,' she said, according to USA Today. 'Every new case means a lifetime burden of difficult and costly treatment and higher risk of early, serious complications.' Nearly 10 per cent of the entire U.S. population - 25.8 million people - is affected by diabetes. Obesity expert David Ludwig, from the Boston Children's Hospital, says the gap in tracked data since 2009 has caused the industry concern that things are getting worse. 'We don't know what happened in the last five years,' he said. 'Most likely, things have gotten worse.' The spike in Type-2 diabetes among children is particularly concerning because it's traditionally referred to as 'adult-onset' diabetes and usually only affects people over the age of 40. And most children who do suffer from it are already obese, experts say, meaning they are facing an array of health problems including heart attacks and organ failure. TYPE-1 ('early-onset'): .

chatgpt: Instances of Type-2 Diabetes up 30 per cent from 2000 to 2009. Type-1 cases up 21 per cent over the same period. Sufferers face a 'lifetime burden' from associated health risks, experts warn. New research reveals an alarming growth in two common forms of diabetes over the past decade, sparking concerns among experts about the increased strain on healthcare systems and the impact of these diseases on patients' quality of life. According to a study published in the Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal, the number of people living with Type-2 Diabetes jumped by almost a third between 2000 and 2009. The report also found a 21% increase in Type-1 cases during the same period. The rise in these conditions is a major concern for healthcare professionals, who warn that sufferers face a lifetime burden from the associated health risks. Diabetes can lead to a range of health complications, including heart disease, kidney disease, and blindness, among others. "Diabetes can be a very debilitating condition that can have a significant impact on a person's quality of life," said Dr. Jane Winterbottom, a diabetes specialist at the Royal College of Physicians in London. She added that the increasing prevalence of diabetes put significant strain on healthcare services, with the condition accounting for around 10% of total healthcare spending in many countries. There are several factors that contribute to the growth in diabetes, including changes in lifestyle and diet, along with an ageing population. Research suggests that the number of people living with diabetes is likely to continue rising in the years to come, making it a major public health challenge. But there is also hope that preventative interventions, such as dietary changes and exercise programmes, can help to reduce the incidence of diabetes and improve outcomes for those living with the condition. "We need to take a comprehensive approach to diabetes prevention and management, focusing on education, lifestyle changes, and early intervention to prevent complications," said Dr. Winterbottom. "While there is no cure for diabetes, we can work together to reduce the number of people who develop the condition and improve the quality of life for those who are already living with it."
