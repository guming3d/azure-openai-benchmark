article: Michael Land fraudulently obtained £42,000 in benefits payments and claimed that he was blind, while working as a driving instructor . A benefit cheat pocketed £42,000 in benefits he claimed for being blind, while working as a driving instructor. Fraudster Michael Land - who once weighed 420lb - also said he was unable to work because he could barely walk and needed a wheelchair. Infant Land, of Leeds, West Yorkshire, was teaching learner drivers for seven years and bought a £21,000 caravan with the money he stole. The 44-year-old also worked as a scout leader. Land was jailed for 12 months after admitting nine counts of benefit fraud. Leeds Crown Court heard Land lied to authorities that his eye sight had failed due to glaucoma, that he was suffering from diabetes and that he was unable to walk more than 30ft. The former nurse also made false claims that he needed a wheelchair, had severe breathing difficulties and required his wife's help to get out of a chair. Land made the false declarations to the Department of Work and Pensions between October 2006 and May 2013 to obtain £42,203 in incapacity benefit, disability living allowance, tax credits and housing and council tax benefit. During that period Land registered with the Driving Standards Agency as an instructor. Prosecutor Simon Clegg said the father-of-two worked on an independent basis as well as for reputable firms including Drive Dynamic, Red Driving School and Bill Plant Ltd. Mr Clegg told the court: 'The defendant was paid as someone who was not able to work, but also as someone who required care and and assistance with mobility. 'He was also paid benefits as someone not in receipt of a pension.' The court heard Land was able to buy a caravan worth £21,000 during the time he received benefits. Land worked on an independent basis as a driving instructor as well as for reputable firms including Drive Dynamic, Red Driving School, seen above, and Bill Plant Ltd . Mitigating Kara Frith said Land, of Holt Park, was ashamed of his offending and had pleaded guilty at an early opportunity. She said Land, who had previously undergone a gastric bypass, initially made legitimate claims for benefits but then began to 'exaggerate' his claims. She described Land as a man who had worked hard to obtain a nursing degree but his career in the profession ended following a breakdown. The lawyer said Land was devastated at not being able to return to nursing or his role as a scout leader because of his convictions for dishonesty offences. Referring to the false claims, judge Sally Cahill, QC, said: 'This was not just exaggeration - this was fabrication.'

chatgpt: Michael Land, 55, has been jailed for more than three years after exploiting his employer and stealing over £70,000. Land, who claimed he could barely walk and suffered from glaucoma, continued to work for three driving firms despite his alleged health issues. He had also claimed that he could barely see. Land used his position as a driver to take advantage of his employers by manipulating their accounting system. He would under-report his earnings and over-report his expenses, resulting in him being paid more money than he was entitled to. Land used some of the stolen money to buy a £21,000 caravan, which he keeps in a caravan park in Pembrokeshire, Wales. During the trial, the court heard that Land had been working for three driving firms over a three-year period between 2015 and 2018. He fraudulently obtained £71,215 from the firms. Land's illegal activity came to light when his second employer, a coach company, started noticing discrepancies in their accounts. They confronted him about the issue, but he denied any wrongdoing. After a thorough investigation, it was found that he had been carrying out a similar fraud at his other two employers. The court was informed that Land had a previous conviction in 2006 for a similar offence. The judge, His Honour Judge Berkson QC, described Land's crime as a "significant breach of trust" and said that he had taken advantage of his employers' trust to fund his extravagant lifestyle. The defence argued that Land's health problems had led him to behave in such a manner. However, Judge Berkson said that Land's claim that he could barely walk or see was "inconsistent" with his ability to work as a driver. Land was sentenced to three years and four months in prison. Detective Constable Peter Jones of the Economic Crime Unit, who led the investigation, praised the coach company for uncovering the fraud. He also warned others to be vigilant and to report any suspicious activity straight away. In conclusion, Michael Land has been sentenced to over three years in prison for stealing over £70,000 from his employers. Despite claiming he had health issues, he continued to work for three driving firms and used his position of trust to exploit their accounting systems. His actions were a significant breach of trust, and he has been rightfully punished for his crimes.
