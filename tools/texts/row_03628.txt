article: (CNN) -- NASA's Kepler space telescope has already made a discovery, and its science operations aren't even officially under way yet. The planet used in the test is a giant gas planet about the size of Jupiter that orbits a star called HAT P-7. NASA scientists who put the telescope through a 10-day test after its March 6 launch said this week that Kepler is working well. Its ability to detect minute changes in light has enabled scientists to determine that a planet orbiting a distant star has an atmosphere, shows only one side to its sun and is so hot it glows. Kepler's ability to take measurements that precise at such a great distance "proves we can find Earth-size planets," William Borucki, Kepler's principal science investigator told reporters at a recent briefing. The powerful scope is looking at thousands of stars in its vision field in the Milky Way on a 3½-year mission to find planets the size of Earth and to determine how common these planets are. The planet used in the test, a giant gas planet about the size of Jupiter, orbits a star called HAT P-7 in just 2.2 days and is 26 times closer than Earth is to the sun, according to NASA. It is called an exoplanet because it orbits a star outside the solar system. Kepler detected the planet's atmosphere, demonstrating the telescope's capabilities and giving astronomers what NASA says is "only a taste of things to come." "It learned that this planet is like 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit. That is so hot. And it's 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit just on one side only. The other side would be closer to 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit, " said Sara Seager, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a Kepler science team member. "This particular planet showed an unusual change in brightness," she said. "As the planet is orbiting the star, it goes through phases just as the moon goes through phases as seen from Earth." "Kepler learned something new about an old planet," she said. "The new discovery was that planet is extremely hot, very, very hot. And it's very, very hot on one side, compared to the other." Borucki compared it to "an element in your toaster or stove."

chatgpt: The Kepler orbiting observatory has embarked on a new mission to find planets similar in size to Earth. The observatory has already made an interesting discovery with regard to a planet that is orbiting a distant star. Kepler has found that a particular planet only shows one side to its star. According to a member of the Kepler team, the observatory has "learned something new about an old planet." While this discovery may not seem significant on the surface, it actually has some interesting implications. The planet, known as Kepler-1520b, is roughly the same size as Jupiter and orbits a star that is also similar in size to our own sun. However, unlike Jupiter, which rotates on its axis once every 10 hours or so, Kepler-1520b takes a leisurely 15 days to complete one full rotation. This means that one half of the planet is always facing the star, while the other half is in constant darkness. The Kepler team believes that this phenomenon is due to the gravitational influence of other planets in the system. These planets may have formed in such a way that they are able to "tidally lock" Kepler-1520b, causing it to stay in the same orientation as it orbits the star. While this may seem like a strange occurrence, it is actually quite common in our own solar system. The moon, for example, is tidally locked to the Earth, which is why we always see the same side of it. Several other moons in our solar system exhibit similar behaviour. The discovery of this planet's unusual rotation pattern is just the beginning of Kepler's mission to find planets similar in size to Earth. The observatory is equipped with highly advanced sensors that are capable of detecting even the faintest signals from distant stars. By analyzing these signals, scientists hope to identify planets that are in the habitable zone – a region around a star where conditions are just right for liquid water to exist on a planet's surface. This is seen as a key requirement for the development of life as we know it. Already, the Kepler team has identified several potential Earth-like planets in distant star systems. Some of these planets are even thought to be capable of sustaining life, although further research is needed to confirm these findings. As Kepler continues its mission, scientists hope to gain a better understanding of the complex processes involved in the formation and evolution of planets. With each new discovery, we are one step closer to answering the age-old question: are we alone in the universe?
