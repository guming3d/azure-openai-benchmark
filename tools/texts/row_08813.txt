'Shoppers are particularly keen on lightweight fabrics which have made the trend a comfortable way to cope with the recent heatwave.' She added: 'Our designer sleepwear has seen the biggest sales increase with colourful floral prints proving most popular - as nightwear becomes more trend lead, many shoppers see it as a shame to resign it solely to the bedroom. 'We are already expecting the trend to continue way into the Christmas party season and have a number of styles that we predict to be popular.' Alain Mehada, head personal stylist at the flagship Debenhams store on Oxfrod Street in central London said the best way to pull off the sleepwear trend in style is to mix bottoms with a tailored jacket to add definition to your silhouette. One should also stick to silky or cotton fabrics and steer clear of flannel, while opting for printed styles and avoiding sheer fabrics or lace. Pyjamas were first introduced in England as lounging attire in the 17th Century, but soon went out of fashion. However, in 1870 pyjamas reappeared in the Western world as sleeping attire for men, after returning British colonials brought them back and adapted the pjjama pant to come without pockets. Pyjama pockets came back into fashion in the 2000s, due to their usefulness in carrying personal items such as mobile phones. In recent years pyjamas or 'lounge wear' have been more commonly worn as daywear mainly due to the popularity of the onesie.
