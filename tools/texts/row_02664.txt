article: John Carver is set to take charge of Newcastle as caretaker manager for at least the next two matches, alongside Steve Stone, following the departure of Alan Pardew. But who is he? Sportsmail tells you all you need to know... John Carver will lead his hometown club as caretaker for the next two matches at least . So who is John Carver? Raised in Cruddas Park, just over a mile from St James’ Park, Carver attended St Cuthbert’s High School, whose alumni also includes Sting and Declan Donnelly. Always regarded as one of the best junior footballers in the city, he was on the books of Newcastle as a teenager and was pals with a young Paul Gascoigne. Carver (left) served as assistant to Alan Pardew before the Newcastle boss left for Crystal Palace this week . His progress, though, was hindered by a thigh injury and his senior career only amounted to a handful of appearances for Cardiff City. He was forced to retire from professional football at 20. What then? He played for Gateshead for three years but all the while was working his way up the coaching ladder in Newcastle, starting out in schools before landing the role of director at United’s School of Excellence in 1992. Carver will take charge of the team alongside Steve Stone (right) for games against Burnley and Leicester . While at Newcastle’s academy he worked with the likes of Shola Ameobi and Steven Taylor. In 1999 it was Ruud Gullit who promoted him to the role of assistant manager. How did that go? Not too well for Gullit, but Carver was kept on by Sir Bobby Robson and he became one of his most trusted lieutenants as the club enjoyed Champions League football for a second time. Carver worked under club legend Sir Bobby Robson until 2004, when he first served as caretaker manager . When Robson was sacked in 2004, Carver took charge of the 3-0 home win over Blackburn and still talks of his ‘100-per-cent record' as Newcastle boss. How did it end at Newcastle? Graeme Souness came in and brought with him his own backroom team. Carver moved to Leeds, where he also had a spell as caretaker boss, before taking over the management reins at Toronto FC in the MLS. The Newcastle caretaker has been full-time manager elsewhere, taking charge of FC Toronto in the MLS . Although successful on the pitch, he had one or two disagreements with the league’s authorities and decided to return to the UK. He then took up assistant roles to Paul Mariner at Plymouth and the late Gary Speed at Sheffield United before returning to Newcastle under Alan Pardew. And how he’s got his big chance? He certainly hopes so and would love nothing more than to take charge of his hometown club on a permanent basis.
