But Britain’s oldest man – who turns 110 tomorrow – says his longevity isn’t entirely down to his strict vegetarian diet or his favourite tipple, gin. The Reverend Reg Dean instead attributes it to a ‘mysterious brown-looking’ elixir of life given to him by a doctor when he was an army chaplain in India. Celebrations: Reg Dean celebrated his 110th birthday in November last year . ‘He said to me, “I have concocted a drink that will make you live for ever”, or something like that, and would I like to take it?’ he recalled yesterday. ‘Well I’m very naive, I can’t say no, so I drank it and here I am.’ The former teacher and church minister was born on November 4, 1902, in Tunstall, Staffordshire. Reflecting on all he has witnessed, he said: ‘I remember before the days of Tarmac, the roads were all dust heaps. ‘I can remember hearing about the sinking of the Titanic when I was at my uncle’s farm.’ Early years: Reg Dean pictured in 1903 aged 11 months and as a choirboy aged 12 .

chatgpt: Reg Dean, who lives in Wirksworth, Derbyshire, is set to celebrate his 111th birthday on Sunday and becomes Britain's oldest man. Dean has lived a long and unique life, with his time in the Second World War as a chaplain in Burma being one of the standout moments. During his service in Burma, Reg Dean received what he calls an 'elixir of life' from an Indian doctor. The doctor made him a special drink that he believes has contributed to his long life. Speaking on his upcoming birthday, Dean said, "I've never drunk, never smoked and thank goodness I took that elixir in the war." The elixir, which is made from Tinospora Cordifolia, is an Ayurvedic supplement that has been used in Indian culture for centuries. It is believed to have various health benefits, including boosting the immune system and reducing inflammation. Indeed, Dean has never suffered any significant illnesses, and his memory remains sharp. Dean's life hasn't been without its challenges; he lost his first wife in 2002 after 63 years of marriage, but he has since found love again with his partner, Reita Bourne. Asked about the secrets to his long life, Dean said that "I have no idea why I have lived so long … perhaps it's because I haven't driven a car since I was 97 and haven't watched the television since I was 103." Dean has become somewhat of a local celebrity in Wirksworth, with people in the town rallying to celebrate his 111th birthday. A socially distanced party has been organized, with decorations and cake at the new care home he moved into in December. Dean's incredible lifespan gives a unique insight into the changing world over the past century. Born in 1902, he has lived through two world wars, the Great Depression, the moon landing, and the rise of the internet. With his sharp memory and love of life, Reg Dean serves as an inspiration to us all, proof that even amid the most challenging times, a positive attitude and a bit of Tinospora Cordifolia can go a long way.
