article: Telescopes come in all shapes and sizes - from orbiting space telescopes just a few metres long to the ambitious 'square kilometer array' planned for South Africa or Australia, where a network of linked dishes will stare at the sky together. But detecting neutrinos - tiny, fast-moving particles that pass easily through matter - is more difficult. Neutrino detectors are often located deep underground, to cut out interference. A new telescope planned for the sea bed under the Mediterranean will be a network of detectors with a volume of several cubic kilometers - each detector is taller than the 830m Burj Khalifa tower in Dubai. The KM3net telescope planned for the sea bed under the Mediterranean will be a network of detectors with a volume of several cubic kilometres, built to detect neutrinos - tiny, fast-moving particles that pass straight through water and even solid rock . 'Any time you detect a particle, what you're always doing is having the particle interact with some kind of matter, whether it's water, steel, air or ice,' says Peter Fisher, a particle physicist at MIT. 'The less the particle interacts, the more material you need for it to interact in.' The sea water in between the 900m KM3Net detectors works as a giant optical 'detector' - the detectors look for 'flashes' caused by neutrinos hitting water molecules. Most of the neutrinos pass straight through, but the few that do collide with atoms will be picked up by the huge telescope. The detector's discoveries could propel research in dark matter and high energy physics. Construction could start as early as next year. The KM3net's detectors compared to some of the tallest towers on earth - each one will be higher than Dubai's Burj Khalifa tower . Over the past decade the three pilot projects have explored the idea, building and deploying smaller scale prototype telescopes designed to operate at depths ranging from 2500 to 4500 m. Antares - on the floor of the Mediterranean near Toulon, France - is now the largest neutrino telescope in the Northern hemispere, made of twelve 350-metre detectors on the sea bed. The Antares detector - a prototype for KM3Net - consists of 12 750m detectors on the sea bed near Toulon, France. It's the current largest on earth . 'The Mediterranean Sea is ideal for these huge structures - thanks to water of excellent optical properties at the right depth and excellent shore-baseddata processing,' says the KM3Net organisation. 'The KM3NeT neutrino telescope will be unique in the world in its physics sensitivity and will provide access to scientific data that will propel research in different fields, including astronomy, dark matter searches, cosmic ray and high energy physics.'

chatgpt: In the quest to unravel the mysteries of the universe, scientists have developed a new detector that is taller than any structure on earth. According to a study published in Physical Review Letters, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory in Antarctica uses 'towers' taller than the Burj Khalifa in Dubai to watch for light flashes in 2.2 billion kg of water. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a unique scientific project that seeks to detect tiny, fast-moving particles known as neutrinos. These particles are almost weightless and can pass straight through matter without interacting with it. The observatory is designed to capture these elusive particles by detecting the faint flashes of light that they emit when they interact with the ice around the detector. The IceCube detector is located deep below the surface of the ice, where it is protected from interference by cosmic rays and other sources of background radiation. The detector consists of more than 5,000 photomultiplier tubes that are arranged in a grid pattern, with each tube capable of detecting a single photon of light. To detect neutrinos, the IceCube team uses a technique known as Cherenkov radiation, in which particles moving faster than the speed of light in a certain medium create a visible light signature. When a neutrino interacts with the ice, it creates a shower of high-energy particles that produce a cone of blue light, which the detector records. The new study shows that the IceCube detector is capable of detecting not only high-energy neutrinos but also lower energy neutrinos that were previously thought to be undetectable. It achieves this by using 'towers' that extend high above the main detector and are filled with a highly reflective material. This enables the detector to pick up even the faintest flashes of light that would otherwise be lost in the background noise. The 'towers' used by the IceCube detector are 21 meters tall, which is taller than the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world. These 'towers' are the key to the IceCube team's success, allowing them to detect low-energy neutrinos that otherwise would have been missed. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is opening new frontiers in our understanding of the universe. By detecting neutrinos, scientists hope to unlock the secrets of the cosmos, including the nature of dark matter and the origin of cosmic rays. With its advanced technology and state-of-the-art detectors, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory is poised to lead the way in the search for answers to some of the most fundamental questions about our universe.
