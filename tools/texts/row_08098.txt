A juror halted a sex assault case just 24 hours after the Tyne and Wear derby when he branded the defendant a 'Mackem rapist'. The man, a Newcastle United fan, is understood to have said he could not give David Blake, from Sunderland, a fair trial so soon after his city's team beat Newcastle 3-0 last weekend. The juror confessed his concerns to court staff and admitted his prejudice before Judge Penny Moreland. Newcastle United lost at home to Sunderland at St James' Park last Sunday, which prompted the juror to say he could not give David Blake a fair trial . The juror, a Newcastle fan, branded Blake a 'Mackem rapist' in the wake of Sunday's Tyne and Wear derby match . As a result, before hearing any evidence from the witness box, he was removed from the panel of jurors. Jurors are given clear a clear warning by judges at the start of every case that they must try defendants on the evidence they hear in court and nothing else. Blake's trial was halted after just half a day, meaning the victim, who was anxiously waiting to give evidence, faced a delay while a new jury was sworn in. The juror was told not to come back to court to complete his fortnight of jury service. As a result of the false start, Blake's victim had to re-live her ordeal by watching her video evidence a second time when it was shown again for the benefit of the new jury. Blake, of North Farm Avenue, Sunderland, who had pleaded not guilty, was eventually found guilty of raping the woman - who had fallen asleep in a spare bed, alone, after a party at a flat. Prosecutor James Adkin told the court the 44-year-old attacker took advantage of his victim's drunk and sleeping state. Mr Adkin said: 'She woke up at about 8am and to her horror she realised the defendant was having sex with her. The juror was dismissed from the panel at Newcastle Crown Court and a new jury sworn in . 'She immediately told him to get off.' When his victim contacted the police minutes after the attack, Blake told officers: 'I started to kiss her, had sex with her, then she woke up.' He later denied confessing and claimed he had said 'she was awake'. Jurors rejected Blake's claim the woman had performed a sex act on him while he was sleeping, which led to them having consensual sex when he woke up. Blake will be sentenced next month and was remanded in custody in the meantime. Judge Moreland warned him: 'I require a report from the probation service to assist with what risk you pose to others. The sentence is inevitable.'

chatgpt: A new jury had to be sworn in at Newcastle Crown Court after a juror branded the defendant, David Blake, a "Mackem rapist," leading to a mistrial. The victim had to sit through her video evidence again due to the restart. Blake was on trial for rape, and during jury deliberations, a juror referred to him as a "Mackem rapist," which is a derogatory term predicated on him being from Sunderland. The judge halted the proceedings as this was considered inappropriate commentary from the juror. The victim had to watch her video evidence again due to the restart, a traumatic experience for her, as she had already discussed the details of the incident in court. Ultimately, a new jury was sworn in, and Blake was found guilty. The incident has sparked outrage among legal experts who fear that labels and derogatory terms can harm the defendant's chances of a fair trial. Juries are supposed to decide cases based on fact and not on heinous labeling. The prosecution team had to start again, calling all the witnesses again, ensuring each testimony was credible without any premeditation, and presenting a fresh case. It is not ideal having to restart a trial as it can cause undue stress on those involved, including the jurors. Blake will now have to wait for sentencing next month. Rape is a severe offense, and it is an emotionally challenging experience for any victim. In this case, the victim already had to go through the trauma of recounting her experience. It is heartening to know that justice has prevailed. The justice system relies on the notion of impartiality, and it is imperative that all those involved commit to that ideal. The incident in Newcastle Crown Court is a reminder of the consequences of inappropriate labeling, especially toward the defendant. Overall, the outcome of the trial is a testament to the integrity of the justice system, and it is heartening to know that those responsible for the crime would be held accountable. However, the incident underlines that more needs to be done to ensure that the anonymity and rights of the defendants are respected within the justice system.  In summary, David Blake was found guilty of rape, and justice has prevailed. However, the incident in Newcastle Crown Court has highlighted a significant issue regarding fair trials, reminding everyone involved of the importance of impartiality that lies at the core of our justice system.
