chatgpt: Tiger Woods made his long-awaited return to competitive golf on Thursday, but it was not the triumphant comeback many had hoped for as he shot a three-over-par 74 in the first round of the Quicken Loans National at Bethesda. Woods, who had not played since March due to a back injury, had a mixed day on the course. He started off strong with a birdie on the third hole, but his game soon faltered, registering bogeys on the sixth, eighth, and 10th holes. He managed to salvage a birdie on the 14th hole, but that was not enough to make up for his earlier errors. Despite this subpar performance, Woods remains optimistic about his return to golf. "I feel like I got a lot out of my round today," he said. "It's been a long road to recovery, and I'm just grateful to be out here playing again." While Woods struggled on the course, Australian golfer Greg Chalmers seized the early lead, shooting a five-under-par 66. Chalmers, who is seeking his first PGA Tour win in over eight years, had a flawless round, registering five birdies and no bogeys. Several other golfers also had a strong showing in the first round, including Chilean golfer Joaquin Niemann and American Beau Hossler, who both shot four-under-par 67s. The Quicken Loans National is being held at TPC Potomac at Avenel Farm and features a prize purse of $7.1 million. It is one of the premier events on the PGA Tour, and many of the world's top golfers are in the field, including defending champion Kyle Stanley and world number three Justin Rose. The event has special significance this year as it serves as a tribute to the military and will honor the 100th anniversary of World War I. Golfers will wear special military-themed hats and bags, and there will be military displays and flyovers throughout the weekend. The Quicken Loans National will continue through the weekend, with the final round scheduled for Sunday. While Woods may be out of contention for the title, fans are sure to tune in to see how he fairs as he continues his comeback from injury.
