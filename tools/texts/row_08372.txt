article: By . Ian Drury . Britain's Prince Harry attends a mission briefing in the British controlled flight-line in Camp Bastion . Blunders by British commanders were ‘devastatingly exploited’ by the Taliban to carry out an attack on Camp Bastion while Prince Harry was deployed in Afghanistan, a damning report says today. Complacency by senior officers meant security was inadequate, allowing heavily-armed insurgents to storm the supposedly impregnable UK base in 2012. The defence select committee was also scathing about the Ministry of Defence, accusing officials of being ‘obstructive and unhelpful’ in the face of the committee’s inquiries to establish what had happened. Two US Marines were killed and 16 troops – eight US and eight British – injured when gunmen swarmed through the perimeter fence to assault the airfield, setting off explosions which destroyed six Harrier jump jets  and three vehicles. Prince Harry was stationed at Bastion to fly Apache attack helicopters. The committee found more than half of the guard towers were regularly unmanned despite at least 20 breaches of the perimeter fence in two years. Troops were exposed to ‘unnecessary risk’ because UK commanders, who were responsible for security, had not put in place sufficient safeguards to ensure a Taliban attack was foiled. Following a US investigation into the incident, two generals were ordered to quit. Incredibly, no-one from Britain has paid the price for the fiasco. The Mail understands at least four officers involved have been promoted. In a highly critical conclusion, the cross-party committee said: ‘We are concerned that the perimeter security and force protection measures in place at the time of the attack were inadequate. ‘Insufficient attention was given to the fundamental requirement of defending Camp Bastion from external assault. Two US Marines were killed and 16 troops injured when gunmen swarmed through the perimeter fence to assault the airfield . 'We believe this was complacent. Given that the attack took place in the British sector of the camp, British commanders must bear a degree of responsibility for these systemic failures.’ The attack on Camp Bastion, which sprawls over 20 sq miles of Helmand, southern Afghanistan, took place on September 14, 2012. At 10pm, 15 Taliban fighters wearing stolen US military uniforms crept towards the base which was ringed by a 30ft wire fence.

A three-hour gun battle raged involving 50 British troops, some of whom won medals for bravery. As well as the coalition casualties, 14 Taliban were killed. The surviving gunman was captured. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: ‘The MoD is not complacent and always seeks to capture and learn lessons from current operations. UK commanders have identified and acted upon all lessons following the attack on Camp Bastion in 2012.’

chatgpt: A report has been released detailing how complacency by senior officers led to inadequate security measures being in place at a UK base in 2012, allowing heavily-armed insurgents to storm the facility. The attack resulted in the deaths of two US Marines and left 16 troops, eight American and eight British, injured. The report reveals that the base, located in the southern province of Helmand in Afghanistan, was considered to be a low threat environment, resulting in a relaxed attitude towards security. However, this complacency was exploited by the insurgents, who were able to breach the base's perimeter and enter the facility. The heavily-armed insurgents were able to wreak havoc on the base, throwing grenades and firing rifles. Despite the valiant efforts of the troops stationed at the base, the attackers were able to cause significant damage and casualties. The report identifies a number of failings that contributed to the security breach. These include inadequate perimeter defences, a lack of surveillance equipment, and insufficient security training for the troops stationed at the base. The report also highlights the need for senior officers to take a more proactive approach to security measures, rather than simply assuming that a base is a low threat environment. This includes ensuring that adequate resources are allocated towards security measures, as well as regular training and drills for troops to ensure they are well-equipped to handle any potential threats. The attack on the UK base in 2012 served as a stark reminder of the dangers faced by troops deployed in conflict zones around the world. However, it also highlighted the need for constant vigilance and a commitment to ensuring that security measures are always up to standard. The report has been welcomed by military leaders, who have pledged to take the necessary steps to ensure that such an attack does not occur again in the future. This includes an increased focus on security training and the implementation of stronger perimeter defences at all bases. The families of the two US Marines who lost their lives in the attack have also welcomed the report, with one mother stating that she was pleased to see that the failings that led to her son's death were being addressed. However, she also noted that more needed to be done to ensure the safety of troops deployed overseas. Overall, the report serves as a stark reminder of the importance of effective security measures in conflict zones. Complacency can have deadly consequences, as was tragically demonstrated in this attack. It is vital that all those responsible for the safety of troops take their responsibilities seriously and ensure that security measures are always up to standard, regardless of the perceived threat level.
