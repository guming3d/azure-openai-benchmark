article: By . James  Nye . A Manhattan court stenographer with a drinking problem jeopardized the outcome of more than 30 verdicts by repeatedly typing 'I hate my job, I hate my job,' instead of the actual trial dialogue. Officials are rushing to repair the damage caused by Daniel Kochanski, 43, with 10 cases going through the appeals process potentially able to claim that crucial evidence is missing in their conviction. Alcoholic Kochanski's transcripts were an utter mess according to court sources familiar with his case saying, 'It should have been questions and answers - instead it was gibberish'. The New York Post compared Kochanski's antics to the meltdown of Jack Nicholson's unhinged character in 1980s The Shining, who writes 'All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy,' again and again. Repetitive: Daniel Kochanski had some form of breakdown while working as a stenographer in a Manhattan court - brought on by his alcoholism . Kochanski, who was fired in March 2012 for misconduct hit either random keys during court proceedings or 'I hate my job'. The most high profile of Kochanski's botched transcripts is the 2010 mortgage-fraud trial of Aaron Hand - who was also convicted of trying to hire a hit man to take-out a witness who would testify against him. Claudia Trupp, of the Center for Appellate Litigation, said her office was handling the appeals in Hand’s and nine other cases. 'I never had a situation where a single court reporter was responsible for so much damage,' she said. At the time of his sacking, Kochanski was summoned to the Manhattan's DA Office and arrested and forced to make sense of his shorthand mess. Even that failed, and at the courts expense and time, judges have been holding 'reconstruction hearings' in which everyone in the case has to testify what they remember. Gibberish: Kochanski, who was fired in March 2012 for misconduct hit either random keys during court proceedings or 'I hate my job' 'This situation is terrible for everybody,' Trupp said. 'It’s very difficult to come up with a sufficient record based on everybody’s recollection years after the event.' The stenogrpaher's father, Ed Kochanski, told the New York Post that his son was an alcoholic - losing his wife and his job. His wife Heather Kochanski said that, 'The pressure of that job pushed him over the edge, leading him to lose everything.' And on the phone to the New York Post, Kochanski denied messing the transcripts up. 'I never typed gibberish. I always did my job 100 percent. I was let go because of substance abuse,' he said. 'I’m in recovery. July will be one year I’m clean,' he said.

chatgpt: A court stenographer in New York has lost his job after being caught repeatedly typing gibberish and "I hate my job" instead of actual dialogue during trials. Daniel Kochanski, 43, has been accused of sabotaging at least 30 cases and putting the appeals of ten convictions at risk. The malpractice was only discovered when judges in affected cases found inconsistencies in the court records and were forced to re-create parts of the trial dialogue. Kochanski had been employed by the court for over a decade and had been responsible for creating transcripts of trials for the record. The revelation has left the legal system in turmoil, with lawyers and judges expressing concern over how much of the trial dialogue has been lost. Some are calling for a full-scale review of all the cases Kochanski worked on, to ensure that justice has not been compromised. Speaking on the matter, a spokesperson for the court said: "We are deeply concerned about the malpractice of Mr. Kochanski. We have taken immediate action and terminated his employment. The integrity of our court system is of paramount importance and we will leave no stone unturned in making sure that justice is served." It has since emerged that Kochanski was struggling with alcoholism, which may have contributed to his bizarre conduct. Colleagues had reportedly noticed that he had become increasingly erratic and was prone to making mistakes. The case has reignited debates about the pressure court stenographers are placed under, with some arguing that the job is an overwhelmingly stressful one. Previous studies have shown that court reporters experience high levels of burnout due to the demanding nature of the work. The American Bar Association has called for better training and support for court stenographers, in order to reduce the likelihood of similar incidents occurring in the future. A spokesperson for the association said: "This case is a wake-up call for those in the legal profession. We need to ensure that those working in our courts have the proper training and support to cope with what can be a very challenging job." Meanwhile, affected cases are still grappling with the fallout from the malpractice. Lawyers for those convicted in the trials are seeking to have their clients' sentences reduced or their cases retried, arguing that the sabotaged transcripts rendered the original trials unfair. The case has sent shockwaves through the legal community and raised important questions about the importance of court stenographers in ensuring justice is served. It is hoped that the incident will lead to positive changes in the training and support provided to those who work within the legal system, and ensure that errors of this kind do not occur again in the future.
