Did your weekend trip to the beach leave you feeling relaxed and refreshed?  Well now there's science that proves exactly why you got that feeling. A new study conducted at the University of Exeter found that there were numerous health benefits to spending time near the ocean. The study was presented last Wednesday at a science policy conference hosted by the American Geophysical Union. Good for you: A study presented on Wednesday by University of Exeter researchers found that living at the beach improves your health . The multi-faceted study conducted several experiments to determine whether being near a beach setting affected health. When a person goes to the beach, 'It's not going to be any great surprise to you that people relax,' said study researcher Michael White. The more complex question was how being near the beach impacted people's health. The researchers studied census data in England and found that those who lived near the coast reported better health. Better at the beach: By looking at census data, researchers found that coastal dwellers were generally healthier than inland natives - especially the lower socioeconomic groups . While one could argue that this may have something to do with wealthier people being able to afford living on the coast, the researchers actually found that it was the lower socioeconomic communities that reported the greatest health benefits. Just moving closer to the beach had an effect on people. The researchers found that moving closer to the sea 'significantly improves people's well being,' about as tenth as much as getting a new job. Moving to the sea may also reduce stress and encourage physical activity, White said. In one experiment the researchers gave study participants a set of pictures with hypothetical hotel room views, then asked how much they were willing to pay for the room. Get well: The researchers believe their results may help start a therapy program based on ocean exposure . Subjects had an option of an ocean view, green fields or cities. The results showed that the majority of the subjects would pay the most for the ocean view. The researchers are continuing to study the health benefits of seaside living. One of their ongoing studies involves putting people in stressful situations like dental surgeries and then placing them virtually in a beach setting or dental room for comparison. Early signs show that people reported feeling less pain when immersed in the seaside setting. One of the study's organizers, Lora Fleming, said their results could help create a form of therapy based on ocean exposure.

chatgpt: Living near the ocean has long been associated with a relaxed and healthy lifestyle. Now, a study conducted at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom has found several pieces of evidence that suggest living near the ocean can actually be good for your health. The study, which was published in the journal Health & Place, analyzed data from 48 different studies that examined the effects of “blue space” on human health. Blue space refers to any open-air, natural water spaces such as oceans, rivers, and lakes. The researchers found that people who live near the ocean are generally healthier and happier than those who live further away. Some of the health benefits of living near the ocean include a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, and other chronic illnesses. The researchers also found that exposure to natural blue spaces can help improve mental health by reducing stress and anxiety. “This research is incredibly important because it shows that being near the ocean can have a positive impact on our health and well-being,” said Dr. Mathew White, the study’s lead author. “By understanding the mechanisms behind these benefits, we can start to develop new kinds of therapy based on ocean exposure.” The study’s findings have important implications for public health policy, particularly in areas that are close to the ocean. According to the researchers, more needs to be done to ensure that people have access to blue spaces and can benefit from their health-promoting effects. One way to promote these health benefits is through the development of “blue prescriptions,” which are prescriptions given by doctors that encourage patients to spend time near the ocean or other bodies of natural, open water. The researchers believe that blue prescriptions could be an effective way to help prevent chronic illnesses and improve overall well-being. The study’s authors also believe that more research needs to be conducted to fully understand the mechanisms behind the health benefits of living near the ocean. For example, it’s not clear why exposure to blue space has a positive effect on cardiovascular health, or how it reduces stress and anxiety. Further research is necessary to answer these questions and help fully develop blue prescriptions as a form of therapy. Overall, the study’s findings provide strong evidence that living near the ocean is good for your health. By promoting access to blue spaces and developing blue prescriptions, public health officials can help improve the health and well-being of people around the world. As Dr. White notes, “the ocean has always been a source of wonder and fascination for people, and now we’re starting to understand that it can also be a source of health and healing.”
