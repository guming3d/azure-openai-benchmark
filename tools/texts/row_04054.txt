Finding time to schedule in exercise around our busy working lives can sometimes seem impossible. But what if your workout came to you? That’s the idea behind a new, pop-up hot yoga studio that travels around offices offering quick classes during workers’ lunchbreaks. Devotees claim hot yoga — the exercise is performed at a high temperature — can calm the mind, help stretching and ease physical woes. Hotpod: Resembling giant inverted bouncy castles, the hotpods are heated up to 38C . Its celebrity fans include Andy Murray and Lady Gaga. Heating the studio to the required temperature often means going to a specialist gym but these new portable ‘hotpods’ aim to change that. Resembling giant inverted bouncy castles, they are plugged into the mains, then inflated and heated to 38C. An instructor uses the space — specially designed with curved walls and muted colours to be relaxing — to guide a class of up to 20 people through an intense hour of yoga. Famous fans: Andy Murray and Lady Gaga swear by the hot yoga practise . Once the lesson is over, the studio is deflated and folded away. Hotpod yoga was launched in three London locations last month, and is now expanding nationwide. Great workout: Yoga can burn up to 700 calories in an hour . ‘We wanted to focus on people who are busy and have little time to exercise,’ explains former strategy consultant Max Henderson, who set up the company with a childhood friend, yoga teacher Nick Higgins. ‘Hotpod Yoga is perfect for corporate businesses because yoga is great for de-stressing as well as being a strenuous workout, burning up to 700 calories in an hour. ‘We thought doing it inside offices meant people wouldn’t have to go anywhere to exercise. Interest has been phenomenal.’ He says all a company needs for the hotpod to be set up is some empty space and showers for participants to use afterwards. ‘I think it is a great concept,’ says Gemma Hamilton, who went to a session in London. ‘The yoga itself was like a Bikram-aerobics hybrid, and the pod was excellent — the mats were clean and they had dotted lovely candles around it.’ Beats a sandwich at the desk any day.
