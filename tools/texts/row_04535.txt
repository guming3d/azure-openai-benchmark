article: (CNN)  -- After deliberating for only 45 minutes, a jury convicted an Alabama man Thursday of throwing his four children off a Gulf Coast bridge in January 2008, according to prosecutors. Lam Luong, 38, admitted throwing the children, who ranged in age from 3 years to 4 months, off the Dauphin Island bridge south of Mobile, according to CNN affiliate WKRG. Charged with five counts of capital murder, he changed his plea to guilty last week. However, Alabama law requires that all capital cases go before a judge and jury, WKRG said. The sentencing phase of Luong's trial will begin Friday, the Mobile County District Attorney's office told CNN. Jurors will decide whether he should receive the death penalty or life in prison without parole. A judge is not bound by the jury's decision, however, and Alabama law requires an automatic appeal in capital cases. Luong and his wife were having marital difficulties, prosecutors said. WKRG reported that during opening arguments in the trial, prosecutors told jurors Luong threw the kids off the bridge so he could see the look on his wife's face. Luong was on crack at the time, and he told investigators they could charge him if they found the children's bodies before breaking into laughter, jurors were told. The defense called no witnesses, but told jurors Luong was intoxicated at the time and was incapable of forming the necessary intent to be convicted of a capital offense, asking them to convict him of manslaughter, WKRG said. During the trial, jurors heard about the search for the children's bodies and saw graphic video of the bodies floating in the water, the station reported. A commercial fisherman recording rough weather off the coast of Venice, Louisiana, found one body, while two duck hunters and a Mississippi marine officer found the other three, according to WKRG. Luong looked down, away from the overhead screens, when the photographs of the children's bodies were shown. CNN's Divina Mims contributed to this report.

chatgpt: A shocking news story has emerged from Alabama where a man named Lam Luong, aged 38, has admitted to throwing his four children off the Dauphin Island bridge. Prosecutors involved in the case have revealed that Luong committed this heinous act so that he could see the look on his wife's face. The four children that were subjected to this cruel act ranged in age from just three years old to just four months old. It is difficult to comprehend how anyone could harm such young and defenceless children, let alone their own father. Luong has shown little remorse for his actions, and the case has left many people across the country feeling outraged and disgusted. The shocking events of that day have left an indelible mark on all those involved. The police and emergency services were alerted to the situation immediately after the children were thrown from the bridge, but tragically, all four children lost their lives. Not only has Luong robbed his children of their lives, but he has left his wife, Phuong Tran, with a lifetime of trauma and unexplainable grief. Luong's trial has now entered its sentencing phase, and the world is waiting for answers. The prosecution team is calling for the maximum sentence possible, citing the unimaginable pain and suffering that Luong has inflicted upon his family and the wider community.

The case has sent shockwaves through the local community and beyond, with people coming together to try and come to terms with what has happened. Feelings of anger, confusion, and sadness have been expressed by many, and there is a keen interest in seeing justice served in this tragic case. As the trial enters its final chapter, friends, family, and the wider community are all looking for answers.
