article: Uncapped Newport Gwent Dragons centre Tyler Morgan is among the latest group of players to sign a national dual contract. Morgan, 19, his Dragons colleague Hallam Amos and Scarlets prop Rhodri Jones have all put pen to paper on deals 60 per cent funded by the Welsh Rugby Union and 40 per cent by the player's region. The trio join Wales captain Sam Warburton and Ospreys flanker Dan Lydiate in agreeing dual contract terms. Tyler Morgan, 19, is one of those to be handed a national dual contract by Wales . Players holding the new contracts - a total of 12 have so far been offered deals, with more signings expected in the near future - will benefit from a total £3.3million fund, with the WRU providing £2m of that and the regions £1.3m. The current list has been drawn up by Wales head coach Warren Gatland, and stems from the Rugby Services Agreement that was signed earlier this year between the WRU and four Welsh regions - Dragons, Scarlets, Ospreys and Cardiff Blues. Morgan, who made nine appearances for Wales Under-20 this year, said: 'I am over the moon to sign a national dual contract. 'The contracts allow us to work closely with the national squad management, and for me that was a big incentive. 'Being able to get that extra advice and guidance will really benefit me going forward.' Wales captain Sam Warburton is one of those on the national deal with the Welsh Rugby Union . Amos, a 20-year-old wing or full-back, made his Wales senior debut against Tonga last year, and was also part of Gatland's squad during the recent autumn Tests. And 22-year-old Jones has become an integral part of Wales' match-day 23, featuring throughout the 2014 RBS 6 Nations Championship and autumn internationals. 'These contracts offer us stability and peace of mind, as well as first-class resources to allow players to concentrate on playing,' Jones said. 'The Scarlets have played a huge part in my career so far, and I hope I can reward theirs and the WRU's faith in me in the coming seasons.' Gatland, meanwhile, added: 'This is another important step forward as some of our youngest prospects commit their futures to the game in Wales. 'The structure we have created means a player's development and welfare is monitored by the national squad management, and this will help players realise their full potential. 'National dual contracts will strengthen the game at national and regional level, and we would like to thank the regions for their help in this process.'

chatgpt: Newport Gwent Dragons centre Tyler Morgan has been awarded a dual contract, making him one of the youngest players to receive the honour. The 19-year-old joins the likes of rugby legends Sam Warburton and Dan Lydiate on the national dual contracts list. Morgan's impressive performance in the 2015 Rugby World Cup earned him a call-up to the Welsh squad, where he made his international debut during the Six Nations tournament in February 2016. His skill in the field has garnered attention from top teams and he has been viewed as one of the brightest prospects in Welsh rugby. In addition, the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) has also handed out dual contracts to two other Newport Gwent Dragons players – back Hallam Amos and prop Rhodri Jones. The move means that both players will play for both club and country, significantly boosting their career prospects. Dual contracts are part of the WRU's efforts to ensure that Welsh rugby players are not lured away by more lucrative offers from clubs abroad. The dual contract allows players to play for a Welsh club and participate in international competitions. The players receive increased financial compensation and resource support, providing a stable and secure platform to build their careers. These efforts have been successful in the past, with several top players such as Warburton and Lydiate returning to Wales after spells abroad to play for their home country. The WRU's dual contract scheme is considered one of the most important developments in Welsh rugby in recent years. The awarding of dual contracts to Morgan, Amos and Jones is a sign of the WRU's commitment to nurturing Welsh talent and ensuring their continued success in international competitions. Welsh rugby fans and supporters will no doubt be excited to see the three players continue to grow and develop their skills while representing their country. The three players have been instrumental in helping the Newport Gwent Dragons excel in the Pro14 tournament, which features teams from Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales. The team has shown significant improvement in the competition under their leadership, with Morgan being the standout performer. As part of the deal, the WRU has also announced it will provide additional resources to the Newport Gwent Dragons, ensuring that the club continues to develop and nurture young talent for the future. Overall, the awarding of the dual contracts is not just good news for the three players, but also for Welsh rugby as a whole. The WRU's commitment to developing its own talent and retaining them is expected to contribute to the continued success of Welsh rugby in international competitions. The move is considered a significant step towards ensuring that Wales remains a dominant force in international rugby.
