article: Thousands of Chinese and South Korean students applying for colleges and universities in the United States face an anxious wait amid claims of widespread cheating during recent SAT tests -- the measure used in the admissions process. Their scores have been delayed pending an inquiry, despite the deadline for college applications fast approaching. "Based on specific, reliable information, we have placed the scores of all students who are current residents of (South) Korea or China and sat for the October 11 international administration of the SAT on hold while we conduct an administrative review," Tom Ewing, spokesperson for test assessors the Educational Testing Service (ETS), said in a statement. "(We) strongly denounce organizations that seek to illegally obtain test materials for their own profit," added Ewing. In recent years, China in particular has experienced a surge in the number of students applying to U.S.-based colleges and universities. But fierce competition in China has led to a culture of cheating, according to Beijing-based educational consultant and teacher Jiang Xuequin. "Chinese people see education as a game to be beaten," he told CNN. "If you can beat it, you're a good player. If you can't beat it, then you're just stupid. Cheating is seen as a fair way to play the game. "There's absolutely no sense of shame in cheating... it's been going on for years." Electronic cheating . Just days ago, 2,440 Chinese students taking a national exam were caught using high-tech cheating gear, from wireless earpieces to "electronic erasers." But the problem isn't unique to China. South Korea, another country with large numbers of students studying in the United States, has been hit cheating as well, with unscrupulous tactics often blamed on intense cramming schools called "Hakwons." Last May, College Board, which runs the SAT system, canceled an SAT testing date in South Korea after tutor companies were suspected to have illegally acquired SAT testing materials in advance and told their students what would be on the test.

chatgpt: Thousands of Chinese and South Korean students who took the SAT on October 11, 2020, will have to wait a little longer for their scores than expected. The Educational Testing Service (ETS), which administers the test, recently announced that it has detected anomalies in the testing process, leading to the suspicion of possible cheating. Barbara Chen, an educator with a focus on China, believes cheating has become a normalized behavior in China amongst students preparing for college admissions. She was quoted in the South China Morning Post after the ETS flagged up incidents of cheating as a “fair way to play the game.” This is not the first time the SAT has been plagued by cheating scandals in Asia. In 2019, ETS had to cancel the test for all South Korean students due to widespread cheating. Consequently, the organization decided to conduct background checks to prevent possible fraudulent activities. "In Korea, it has recently gotten out of hand. But cheating has been a problem for years in that part of the world with our tests," ETS Vice President Peter Brown said in an interview with Korea JoongAng Daily. There is a growing concern that the SAT is becoming vulnerable to manipulation by external actors who aim to secure competitive advantages. In this context, the cheating scandal has ramifications beyond the affected students' individual futures. Such incidents of cheating run against the fundamental principles of equity and fairness upon which the SAT is based. As such, ETS is obliged to protect the integrity of the SAT and take the necessary measures to ensure that its testing procedures' integrity is not compromised. ETS has not disclosed the exact number of affected students or the type of anomalies that led to the score delays. However, the organization has assured students and parents that they will receive their scores as soon as possible. In conclusion, this SAT cheating scandal highlights the wider issue of students and parents feeling under pressure to perform and achieve the best grades possible. The SAT's potential vulnerability to manipulation underscores the need for greater accountability and oversight by international education authorities. The ultimate goal must be to ensure that all students are on a level playing field and can achieve their full potential, without the need for unethical shortcuts.
