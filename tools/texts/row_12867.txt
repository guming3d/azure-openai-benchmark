article: It is the season for travel chaos and passengers travelling from Gatwick and Heathrow appear to have the worst experience, according to statistics. Nearly half of all departures from the two London airports were delayed or cancelled last Christmas and New Year. Overall, two in five UK departures (38 per cent) were affected, with Heathrow sitting well above the average at 47 per cent. New research finds that 38% of all UK departures disrupted near the holidays - with Heathrow averaging 47% . Of the 9,521 flights departing from Heathrow over last year's festive season, 4,409 were delayed and 63 were cancelled due to high winds and rain. This new research comes from flightright.co.uk, a consumer portal for air passenger compensation on delayed, cancelled or overbooked flights. And the UK's next largest airport did not fare much better. Over 45 per cent of departures were affected at Gatwick Airport, while Bristol, Newcastle and Manchester rounded up the top five. The UK's second largest airport, Gatwick, does not fare much better - 45% of all flights were affected last year . The silver lining? London Stansted does fairly well with on-time departures with only 27% delayed . For those flying out of the capital, there is some good news, however: London Stansted fared better than average, with just 27 per cent of departures delayed or cancelled. Flight departures from December 20, 2013, through January 5, 2014, were analysed by the company and the top 10 worst UK airports were identified. 1. London Heathrow - 47% . 2. London Gatwick - 45% . 3. Bristol - 37% . 4. Newcastle - 36% . 5. Manchester - 36% . 6. Glasgow GLA - 35% . 7. Southampton - 33% . 8. Cardiff - 32% . 9. Edinburgh - 31% . 10. Liverpool - 31% . And for anyone who was caught up last Christmas, there may be a silver lining. Marek Janetzke, Managing Director of flightright, said: 'The Christmas and New Year holiday remains a peak time for air travel in the UK, and with the unpredictable winter weather, delays and cancellations are common. Looking for a distraction during your delay? Thankfully there are plenty of shops in London Heathrow . 'Unfortunately, most passengers still do not know about their rights as airlines frequently leave them without information or don’t tell them that they are entitled to compensation or support. Airlines may be obliged to provide snacks, refreshments, telephone calls (or other means of communication), or hotel accommodation – even if they are not responsible for the issue. 'It only takes a three hour delay to be eligible for compensation of around £200. 'Potential compensation can reach up to £475 per passenger depending on the flight distance and delay time. 'UK passengers have up to six years to make a claim compensation so it’s not too late to claim for flight delays over last Christmas.'

chatgpt: Holiday travel may once again prove to be a stressful and chaotic experience for travellers passing through Heathrow Airport. The airport, along with Gatwick Airport, had almost 50% of its departures disrupted last year, causing significant inconvenience to passengers. According to data released by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), Bristol, Newcastle, and Manchester airports landed in the top five airports with the worst delay records. These airports experienced extensive delays and cancellations, making the already stressful experience of holiday travel all the more trying for passengers. The situation is particularly bad for those travelling through Bristol Airport, which experienced a staggering 40% of its flights delayed or cancelled in 2018. Meanwhile, 37% of departures from Newcastle and 36% of departures from Manchester were affected, leaving travellers stranded or scrambling to make alternative travel arrangements. Thankfully, there are options for those travelling out of London. Stansted Airport presents a preferable alternative, with just 27% of flights impacted by delays or cancellations last year. While still not ideal, Stansted is seemingly the most reliable option for travellers hoping to avoid the woes of delayed or cancelled flights. Of course, the question remains as to why holiday travel proves to be such a minefield for passengers. While some issues, such as adverse weather conditions, are beyond the control of airlines, there have been reports of insufficient staffing and limited runway capacity contributing to the problems experienced by travellers. With the rise in air traffic and ever-increasing passenger numbers, airports and airlines alike may need to take a hard look at their infrastructure and processes to ensure holiday travel doesn't become an ongoing headache for passengers. As a result of extensive airport delays and disruptions last year, the CAA has beefed up its regulatory stance. The watchdog is calling for greater transparency regarding delays and cancellations, with airlines having to submit more detailed information regarding disruptions on a quarterly basis. The CAA's goal is to provide passengers with more accurate and timely information about any travel disruptions. This would mean that travellers could make more informed decisions about their travel plans and potentially avoid delays and disruptions altogether. While the prospect of holiday travel may seem daunting, there are steps that passengers can take to help ensure a smoother journey. Arriving at the airport early, checking in online, and choosing a reliable airline can all help to minimise the risk of disruption. Additionally, travellers may wish to consider purchasing travel insurance with disruption cover, to protect themselves financially in the event of delays or cancellations. Overall, the news of possible holiday travel chaos for those passing through Heathrow Airport and other key airports around the country is undoubtedly concerning for many travellers. However, with the right preparation and awareness, passengers can increase their chances of a hassle-free journey. By staying informed and taking necessary precautions, holidaymakers can hopefully avoid any significant travel disruptions and focus on the enjoyment of their time away.
