Red squirrels have been native to Britain for almost 10,000 years, but were almost wiped out when greys were introduced from North America in the 19th century. They managed to survive only in isolated areas of the north of England, the Isle of Wight and Scotland. But last month it was revealed the endangered species is making a comeback in UK woodlands - while their pox-carrying grey cousins are declining. Research carried out across 300 woodlands over three months in the north of England showed the reds managed to expand their habitat by 7 per cent compared with spring last year - while greys' territory had shrunk by as much as 18 per cent.
