article: By . Harry Slavin . Crystal Palace will be in safe hands at the weekend when Keith Millen takes the helm once more. Palace failed this week in their bid to replace Tony Pulis but have a reliable stop-gap in the 47-year-old, whose caretaker managerial experience shows a proven track record in a notoriously tricky role – helping Bristol City preserve Championship status in 2010 and aiding the Selhurst Park revival last term. Malky Mackay had looked poised to take over at Palace but is now out of the running for the job following Sportsmail's revelations about the Scot and Iain Moody being accused of sending racist, sexist and homophobic text messages during their time together at Cardiff. I'm your man: Crystal Palace caretaker boss Keith Millen (left) and chief Steve Parish (right) Promising signs: Millen took charge of the narrow defeat by Arsenal on the opening day of the season . Millen took charge of the Eagles’ first match of the season as they went down fighting at the Emirates Stadium, Aaron Ramsey’s late goal securing a last-gasp 2-1 win for Arsenal. And he’ll be continuing his fourth stint as an interim replacement in English football when he takes charge against West Ham on Saturday. BRISTOL CITY . 2005 .

Millen first took on the role while he was assistant boss at Bristol City in 2005, after player-manager Brian Tinnion left the club, drawing and losing his two games before Gary Johnson was appointed. Johnson led the club to promotion from League One to the Championship but it was left to Millen to save the club’s second-tier status when the manager left by mutual consent in 2010. A draw against league leaders Newcastle in his first game impressed and five wins from their final nine games steered the Robins to safety. Millen was awarded the role permanently at Ashton Gate after Steve Coppell left the role after just four months in charge at the beginning of the 2010-11 season. He led City to a 15th place finish in the table and picked up his first manager of the month award after three wins in five in November. However he left his position the following season after a poor start, which culminated in a 5-0 thrashing at Blackpool, before joining the Eagles as assistant in November 2012. And he found himself back in the temporary hotseat last season after Ian Holloway’s departure, taking charge of four games, including a 0-0 draw at home to Everton and a 1-0 victory at Hull.

chatgpt: Crystal Palace, the Premier League club, currently finds itself in a difficult situation as it continues to search for a new manager. The club’s former manager, Tony Pulis, left the position last week due to reasons that are still unclear, leaving the club without a manager only a week before the start of the Premier League season. With the season looming, Palace fans are anxious to hear who their new manager will be and are hoping that their team will continue to perform as strongly as they did last year. Until recently, it seemed that Malky Mackay would be the man to take the reins at the club. However, new text message revelations have made it clear that Mackay is not a viable option for the club. The decision not to appoint Mackay was taken due to these revelations about the content of the text messages that he had sent while working for Cardiff City. These messages were found to be racist, sexist, and homophobic in nature, causing a great deal of controversy. With Mackay no longer in the running, Keith Millen has once again been appointed as caretaker boss for the upcoming West Ham clash. Millen has been in this position before, having served as caretaker boss at both Bristol City and Crystal Palace. He has been successful in this role, having done well in each of his stints. Millen, who joined Crystal Palace in 2013 as assistant manager, has a long history of involvement in football. He was a member of Bristol City’s coaching staff for 14 years before joining Palace. During his time at Bristol City, he had several stints as caretaker boss, each of which he managed very successfully. Despite the fact that Millen is only in the role of caretaker boss, Palace fans are hopeful that he will take the team to victory against West Ham. They are aware of the incredible skill and experience that he brings to the table, and have faith that he will use this to the team’s advantage. With the start of the Premier League season fast approaching, it is imperative for Crystal Palace to find a permanent manager as quickly as possible. Fans are eagerly waiting to see who will be appointed to take over the reins of the club. If the club is to have any success in the upcoming season, it is essential that they have a good manager at the helm. In conclusion, Crystal Palace is without a manager after the recent departure of Tony Pulis. While Malky Mackay was initially in the running for the job, revelations about the content of his text messages have led to his removal from consideration. Keith Millen has once again been appointed as caretaker boss for the club, and fans are hopeful that he will lead them to victory in the upcoming West Ham clash. However, with the season just around the corner, it is important for the club to appoint a new permanent manager as soon as possible to ensure a successful season.
