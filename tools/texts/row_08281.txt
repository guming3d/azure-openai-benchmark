Kyle Morgan, 23, from Lydney, Gloucestershire, was sentenced to a 12-month community order with 150 hours of unpaid work and ordered to pay £1,384.

A package containing cannabis arrived at Kyle Morgan's house on Queen Street (pictured) in Gloucestershire . Prosecutor David Scutt said UK Borders Agency intercepted a parcel addressed to Jake at Morgan's home on September 13 last year and found it contained 100 grams of cannabis. And when police went to the address in October with a search warrant they initially found a small amount of cannabis worth £8, but then a parcel arrived containing a far larger quantity. 'A parcel was delivered during the course of the search which was also addressed to Jake,' said Mr Scutt. 'In the parcel, police found 91.4g of cannabis valued at £914. A number of identical empty bags were found in the premises.' Kyle Morgan was sentenced to a 12-month community order at Gloucester Crown Court . Morgan, who had no previous criminal convictions, admitted two offences of evading the prohibition on the importation of illegal drugs. He said the small amount of cannabis was for his own use and the package was for a friend called Jake who had asked if he could have mail delivered there, according to Mr Scutt. Matthew Harbinson, defending, said Morgan committed the offences out of 'naivety'. He said Morgan had no connection or influence with others higher up the chain. 'He is a young man who is highly unlikely to be troubling the courts again,' said Mr Harbinson. Judge Hart said he was 'somewhat sceptical' about the truth of Morgan's explanation but it was not challenged by the prosecution and he therefore sentenced him on that basis. 'It is clear you are ashamed of yourself for having got into this position,' said the judge. He ordered the confiscation of £1,084 from Morgan under the Proceeds of Crime Act and ordered him to pay £200 costs.

chatgpt: A 23-year-old man from Lydney, Gloucestershire, has been ordered to pay £1,384 and sentenced to a 12-month community order with 150 hours of unpaid work after a parcel containing 91.4g of cannabis valued at £914 arrived during a police search. Kyle Morgan, the defendant, claimed that he allowed deliveries from abroad on behalf of a man named "Jake". However, the court found that Morgan was knowingly involved in the importation and sale of controlled drugs. The package, which was addressed to Morgan, was discovered by the police during the search of his home on March 25. The police found text messages on Morgan's phone that indicated he was involved in drug dealing. Morgan initially denied any wrongdoing but eventually pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply cannabis. His defense lawyer argued that his client was a "naive" and "vulnerable" individual who had been exploited by others. However, the judge dismissed this argument, stating that Morgan had shown a "blatant disregard for the law", and that drug dealing had a "serious and harmful effect on society". The judge added that the sentence imposed would serve as a warning to others who may be tempted to engage in drug dealing. The case highlights the growing problem of drug trafficking in the United Kingdom. According to the National Crime Agency, drug trafficking is a major source of revenue for organized crime groups, with an estimated £10.7 billion worth of drugs sold annually in the UK. In recent years, the police have been cracking down on drug trafficking, with a particular focus on intercepting drug shipments in the mail. Last year, the police seized a record 6.4 tonnes of cocaine and 4.4 tonnes of heroin in the UK. Despite these efforts, drug trafficking remains a significant problem, with criminal gangs using increasingly sophisticated methods to smuggle drugs into the country. The case also highlights the importance of community sentences in tackling drug-related crime. Community sentences, which aim to rehabilitate offenders and reduce their likelihood of reoffending, are a key part of the UK's criminal justice system. However, critics have argued that community sentences are too lenient, and that more needs to be done to prevent drug trafficking and other forms of organized crime in the UK.
