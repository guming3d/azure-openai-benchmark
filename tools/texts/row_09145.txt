The two were walking back to their apartment in Marrakech Plaza (a general view of the area pictured above) 'They had to go to hospital with some broken hands but hopefully they will be OK,' line producer Ahmed Abounouom told Deadline. 'This could have happened anywhere in the world. It was not on the set and it had nothing to do with the project.' NBC has refused to identify the workers, but a source close to the show says its not believed that either are American since most of the crew working on set in Morocco are not from the U.S. The incident did not take place on set, and filming has continued on schedule. Odyssey premieres on NBC on April 5. The series stars Pushing Daisies' Anna Friel as a female soldier in North Africa dealing with an international conspiracy. Twilight's Peter Facinelli  plays an attorney. Jake Robinson, of the Carrie Diaries, also starts on the show. Morocco has recently become a hub for Hollywood productions looking to film in a Middle Eastern or exotic location, since it is more stable than its other North African neighbors. Recent productions that have shot in the country include American Sniper, Game of Thrones and Mission: Impossible 5.

chatgpt: Two crew members of the upcoming NBC series 'Odyssey' were attacked in Marrakech on Tuesday night while walking back to their apartment after dinner. NBC has not yet released the names of the two members, who were a first assistant director and a make-up artist.  The attack happened when a group of youths approached the two crew members and began to attack them. One of the victims suffered severe cuts, while the other sustained a broken arm. Both were hospitalized immediately and are currently receiving treatment.  'Odyssey' is set to premiere on April 5th and features a star-studded cast, including Anna Friel from 'Pushing Daisies' and Peter Facinelli from the 'Twilight' franchise. The show follows the story of three families as they become entangled in an international military conspiracy. The series was filmed on location in Morocco, including Marrakech. Many are concerned about the safety of the cast and crew in Morocco in light of this attack. While the nation is known for its hospitality and welcoming culture, there is some level of crime that occurs, especially in tourist areas.  NBC has released a statement regarding the attack, saying, "We are deeply saddened by the incident involving two of our crew members in Morocco. Our thoughts are with them and their families during this difficult time. We will continue to provide them with the necessary support and care."  The incident has sparked conversation about the need for increased security measures for television and film productions shooting in foreign countries. However, it should be noted that this is a rare occurrence and that the vast majority of foreign productions move forward without incident. The attack on the two crew members is a reminder that even in the most unexpected places, crime can still occur. While the investigation into the attack is ongoing, it is hoped that the victims will have a full recovery and that the filming of 'Odyssey' can continue without further incidents.
