An aggressive species of crayfish which has been invading England's waterways is being tracked with radio transmitters in a bid to understand why they move so quickly - and help control their advance. The American predators have colonised the River Lee near Enfield, moving at more than 500m per month. The crayfish have now taken over 17km of the river. The Environment Agency said virile crayfish, which are non-native, prey on native wildlife and spread crayfish plague, a disease deadly to native white-clawed crayfish. It is believed that virile crayfish arrived in the UK after an aquarium owner released them into an east London pond. The predatory North American crayfish are believed to have escaped an aquarium in East London before colonising a river. Now they are being fitted with radio transmitters . The Environment Agency has fitted small radio transmitters on the backs of the unwelcome guests, with preliminary results showing that virile crayfish are moving upstream at a rate of 500 metres (1,640ft) per month. This is substantially faster than their cousin, the signal crayfish, which is also non-native. The UK's only native crayfish, the white clawed crayfish, was wiped out along the River Lee following the invasion of the signal crayfish in the 1980s and the associated spread of crayfish plague. Adam Ellis, environmental monitoring officer at the Environment Agency, said: 'Whilst rivers in England and Wales are cleaner than they have been for decades, there is still a lot to be done in order to return them to full health. This includes the control of invasive species like virile crayfish.' I fought the claw and the claw won: Undated Environment Agency handout photo of Inger Jennings, Environmental Monitoring Officer with a virile (right) and signal crayfish (left) 'By tracking the colonisation of the River Lee by virile crayfish, we will better understand how this species impacts the environment and our native wildlife.' 'However, one of the most important ways to protect our wildlife is to stop the spread of non-native invasive species. We're appealing to the public not to release unwanted pets into the wild.' Anyone who catches a crayfish must follow strict guidelines on how to handle them in order to prevent their spread and the transmission of crayfish plague. The rise of invasive species is a major challenge in meeting tough new EU targets on the ecology of rivers and lakes. They cost the UK economy an estimated £1.7 billion every year, according to the Environment Agency.

chatgpt: A river in Enfield, north London, is being taken over by American signal crayfish. These invasive species are moving at an alarming rate of 500 meters a month, and are causing devastation to the ecosystem of the Enfield waterway. These crayfish have been introduced to the UK in the 1970s but due to their aggressive nature they have out-competed native crayfish and decimated their population. Not only do they eat native wildlife, they also spread a lethal plague that can kill off other aquatic life. This lethal disease was first discovered at a waterway in Norfolk in 2014 and has been spreading across the UK ever since.  Experts suggest that the signal crayfish are devastating aquatic ecosystems across the country, causing a significant decline in biodiversity. They believe that these predators have an insatiable appetite, which means that they'll eat almost anything they encounter in the waterway. This includes native crayfish, fish, amphibians, and invertebrates, and even small mammals if they're hungry enough. This invasive species is not just causing problems for wildlife, it is also having an impact on the economy of Enfield. The crayfish are also causing damage to the river banks and are interfering with recreational activities such as fishing, boating, and swimming. Local authorities are working to control the population of signal crayfish in the area, but it’s an uphill battle. There is no simple solution to controlling the spread of signal crayfish. The best way to prevent them from spreading is to avoid releasing them into rivers in the first place. But unfortunately, many people continue to release signal crayfish into rivers as a means of controlling the populations of other invasive species such as zebra mussels. The Enfield council is taking action, advising locals to avoid introducing any foreign or invasive species into the local waterways. Additionally, they are creating reserves and safe havens for the native critters living in the river—all with the aim of ensuring that they are protected in their natural habitat. Despite the challenges, conservationist remain optimistic. There are signs of recovery in other parts of the world, where communities have worked together to eradicate and control the spread of these predators. With local authorities and the community working together, it's possible to protect the biodiversity of Enfield's waterways from further damage caused by the predatory nature of the invasive signal crayfish. Overall, the future of the region's natural inhabitants hangs in the balance, and everyone must work towards finding an effective solution to keep the environment safe and thriving.
