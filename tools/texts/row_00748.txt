chatgpt: In a shocking and disturbing attack, Mikayla Capers, a nine-year-old girl, was stabbed 16 times as she went out for ice cream in East New York. The incident, which occurred in 2014, also resulted in the death of PJ Avitto, a six-year-old boy who was with Mikayla at the time of the attack. Recently, a convicted felon was charged with the brutal attack on Mikayla and the murder of PJ. Daniel St. Hubert, 31, was released from prison just days before the attack after serving five years for attempted murder and assault. St. Hubert is believed to have attacked the two children in the elevator of an apartment building in East New York. According to witnesses, St. Hubert approached the children and started stabbing them with a kitchen knife. He then fled the scene, leaving behind two young victims fighting for their lives. PJ Avitto died from his injuries, while Mikayla Capers miraculously survived the brutal attack. She spent weeks in the hospital recovering from her injuries, undergoing surgery and rehabilitation. Since the attack, Mikayla has become a symbol of hope and resilience, inspiring many with her determination to overcome the physical and emotional scars of the attack. She has also been vocal in advocating for justice for her friend PJ and herself. The recent charges against St. Hubert have brought some closure to Mikayla and PJ's family, who have been waiting for justice for seven years. St. Hubert was indicted on a total of seven counts, including murder, attempted murder, assault, and criminal possession of a weapon. The case against St. Hubert is expected to be a long and complex one, as the prosecutors will have to prove beyond reasonable doubt that he was responsible for the attack on Mikayla and the murder of PJ. The defense, on the other hand, is likely to argue that St. Hubert was wrongly accused and that the evidence against him is circumstantial. Despite the challenges ahead, Mikayla and PJ's family can take comfort in the fact that the person responsible for their trauma and pain is finally being brought to justice. The case serves as a reminder of the importance of prison reform and the need to address the issue of recidivism, in order to prevent similar tragedies from happening again in the future.
