chatgpt: A pawn shop owner in Florida is at the center of a developing story involving a stolen gemstone worth nearly $1 million. The diamond was part of a $39 million heist that took place in Manhattan in December 2019. The pawn shop owner, whose identity has not been released, paid $386,000 for the diamond, which he claims he had no knowledge was stolen. The diamond in question is a D-color flawless diamond weighing over 7 carats. It was stolen from a safe deposit box at a Manhattan bank, alongside other jewelry worth around $38 million. The thieves are still at large, and the recovery of the diamond marks the first significant break in the case. The pawn shop owner claims he purchased the diamond from a person who came into his shop with the gem. According to the shop owner, the individual said they were in need of quick cash and offered to sell the diamond. The shop owner said he conducted standard procedures, such as checking for a certification and reviewing the seller's identification. The diamond had a certification from the Gemological Institute of America, which is the leading diamond certification institute in the world. After purchasing the diamond, the pawn shop owner reportedly attempted to sell it, but was unable to find a buyer. He then sent the gem to the Diamond Certification Institute in New York for an updated certification and valuation. It was at this point that the institute realized the diamond was part of the 2019 heist. According to sources familiar with the matter, the pawn shop owner fully cooperated with law enforcement once he learned of the diamond's origin. He is not facing charges at this time, and his attorney stated that he is "fully cooperating with authorities to resolve this matter." The Diamond Certification Institute in New York is currently in possession of the diamond, and it is unclear when it will be returned to its rightful owner. The institute has declined to comment on the situation, citing privacy concerns. The recovery of the diamond marks a major step in the investigation of the 2019 heist. Law enforcement officials have stated that they are hopeful that it will lead to the recovery of additional stolen items and the capture of those responsible for the crime. While the pawn shop owner claims he had no knowledge of the diamond's stolen status, some experts in the industry have expressed skepticism. "It seems unlikely that someone would walk into a pawn shop with a diamond of this caliber and be willing to sell it for such a low price," said one expert. "Most people who own diamonds like this would go through a reputable dealer or auction house to sell it." The case is ongoing, and law enforcement officials continue to investigate the 2019 heist. The recovery of the stolen diamond marks a significant breakthrough in the investigation, and officials are hopeful that it will eventually lead to the capture of the individuals responsible for the crime.
