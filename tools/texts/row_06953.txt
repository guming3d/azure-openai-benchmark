article: (CNN) -- I am extremely blessed. My unborn son, Claiborne, is due just before Father's Day this year. His pending birth motivated me to get an annual physical six months ago, a checkup I had avoided for three years. When my physician, Dr. Kenneth Kennedy, asked whether I wanted a prostate-specific antigen test, I agreed, despite the $150 out-of-pocket charge. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force advises against routine prostate cancer screenings. The debate over the necessity of these tests is ongoing in research labs and doctor's offices across America. Despite the controversy, a good friend of mine, who also happens to be a doctor, told me to always have my PSA levels screened after age 40. His belief is that there are still many men who are diagnosed in their 40s and that if executive health programs include the PSA test for men beginning at that age, then the test should be done, regardless of government guidelines and/or family history of cancer. Prostate cancer screening remains common . My PSA test results were higher than normal, not indicating certain cancer but suggesting the need for a biopsy, which I chose to do right away. It was an ordinary workday when I got a call from Dr. Haden Lafaye. I tried joking about his Hai Karate aftershave but was cut short: My biopsy results had come back positive for high-risk prostate cancer. I'm a 47-year-old husband and father of one -- with another on the way -- and the results came as a complete shock. I had no symptoms, and up until this point, I thought I was healthy as a horse. How was I going to tell my pregnant wife that I had prostate cancer? After tests, blood draws and CT scans, my urologist, Dr. Surena Matin, told me that my cancer was localized, and we scheduled my da Vinci Prostatectomy -- a minimally invasive treatment for prostate cancer in which the surgeon uses a "robot" as the vehicle to remove the prostate. My incredible team of doctors diagnosed the cancer so early and did such an expert job removing my prostate that I didn't need any additional cancer treatment. No radiation. No hormone therapy. I was cancer-free. I was stunned. This Father's Day, I urge dads everywhere to schedule an annual checkup. The dads I know are always there for their families -- sometimes, at the expense of their own health. The men I know don't like talking about doctors and checkups, especially when it comes to an illness that can profoundly affect their masculinity. I'm hoping that by sharing my story, I can change perceptions about prostate cancer and reinforce the fact that we are all responsible for our own well-being. In my case, if I hadn't visited my doctor six months ago for an annual checkup, I believe that I would not have as many Father's Days to spend with my wonderful family and new son.

chatgpt: Andrew Webster, a father of one with another child on the way, is urging dads all around to prioritize their health and get a checkup, specifically for prostate cancer. Despite government guidelines advising against routine prostate cancer screenings, Webster credits the PSA test for saving his life. Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers among men, and it is estimated that in the United States alone, one in every eight men will be diagnosed with it at some point in their life. Although it primarily affects men over the age of 50, younger men can also develop the cancer. Prostate cancer occurs when abnormal cells grow and divide uncontrollably in the prostate gland, a small walnut-shaped gland in the male reproductive system. Early detection is key when it comes to prostate cancer, but prostate cancer screenings can be a highly controversial issue. The United States Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against routine prostate cancer screenings, as the tests can result in false-positive results and can lead to unnecessary treatment that can harm quality of life. However, Webster is a firm believer that the PSA test can be life-saving. Webster’s story serves as an important reminder that men should prioritize their health, especially regarding prostate cancer. During a routine checkup, Webster’s doctor recommended he take the PSA test, which measures the amount of prostate-specific antigen in a man’s blood. His PSA levels were elevated, and he was referred to a specialist who conducted further tests, eventually leading to his prostate cancer diagnosis. Thanks to early detection, Webster's cancer was caught in its early stages, and he was able to receive minimal treatment. Today, he is cancer-free and encourages other men to get tested. "If not for the PSA test, I wouldn't be here today," Webster shared. "It's critical for men to prioritize their health and get checked out, even if they feel fine." While routine screenings may not be recommended, experts do stress the importance of being aware of one's own health, family history, and risk factors that may increase the chances of developing prostate cancer. Noticing symptoms such as difficulty urinating, pain in the lower back, hips, and upper thighs, or blood in the urine or semen should never be ignored and men should seek medical attention promptly. Webster's story can serve as a motivation to both fathers and future fathers alike, to schedule a check-up with their physician and speak to them regarding their prostate health. While prostate cancer screenings may not be routine, speaking to a medical professional and understanding personal risk factors can potentially result in lifesaving early detection in the future.  In conclusion, Andrew Webster's battle with prostate cancer and his eventual recovery serves as an important reminder that men should prioritize their health and get checked. While routine screenings may not be recommended, it's vital that men understand the symptoms and risk factors of prostate cancer and speak to their physician regarding their health. Early detection can be life-saving, and Webster's story serves as a testament to that.
