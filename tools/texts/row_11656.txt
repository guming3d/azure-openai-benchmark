article: WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The State Department on Monday continued to publicly downplay the threat North Korea presents to the United States with spokesman P.J. Crowley telling reporters North Korea "represents an infinitesimal threat to the United States directly." A North Korean soldier looks at the South Korean side of the demilitarized zone earlier this month. The spokesman's statement followed comments from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in an interview with ABC, broadcast Monday, in which she said the reason for the United States' low-key reaction to North Korea's recent missile test was that the United States wasn't "going to give the North Koreans the satisfaction they were looking for, which was to elevate them to center stage." In that interview, Clinton said North Korea has a "constant demand for attention," and she added, "maybe it's the mother in me, the experience I've had with small children and teenagers and people who are demanding attention: Don't give it to them." After calling the direct threat to the U.S. "infinitesimal," Crowley went on to say that "North Korea, and its provocative actions, does represent a significant threat to the region and its actions recently have been unhelpful and potentially destabilizing." A senior U.S. official, who did not want to be identified, said there is a "theoretical" question of whether a North Korean missile could hit the United States. "There's nothing in their recent development," he said, "which would suggest that their technology is becoming more accurate." The United States says its primary concerns about North Korea's actions are its impact on security in the region and the risk of nuclear proliferation. Last week the United Nations imposed sanctions on a number of individuals, companies and goods connected with North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. Taking aim at several key North Korean officials, it subjected them to a freeze on their assets and an international travel ban.

chatgpt: The United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has labeled North Korea's recent missile tests as a "constant demand for attention" and explained that's why the US had a low-key reaction to them. She made her comments while speaking at a town hall meeting in the Bangladesh capital Dhaka on Sunday. Clinton also noted that the country's "constant demand for attention and drama" could potentially destabilize the region. Speaking to reporters during a news briefing earlier in the day, State Department spokesman John Kirby echoed Clinton's remarks, saying, "We've seen past actions and statements from North Korea that have been very dangerous and very provocative, and we don't want to see that again." These remarks come a few days after North Korea tested a missile it claimed was capable of carrying a nuclear warhead. The launch is regarded as the latest in a series of provocative weapons tests carried out by the country despite objections from the international community. North Korea's missile tests have raised concerns, not only in Asia but also in the US. With each missile test, the country challenges the US dominance, and the increasing frequency of the tests is seen as North Korea's push for recognition as a nuclear power. Despite the concerns, Hillary Clinton's remarks indicate that the US will not be deterred by North Korea's actions. Instead, the country continues to back measures that increase the pressure on the country to halt its provocative missile program. "We need to make it clear to North Korea that what they're doing is unacceptable," Clinton said. The UN Security Council adopted a new resolution in March tightening sanctions against North Korea, aimed at curbing its nuclear and missile programs. It is yet to be seen if the new resolution will have any impact on North Korea's behavior. In conclusion, the US has taken a low-key reaction towards North Korea's recent missile tests, with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton suggesting they are part of North Korea's constant demand for attention. However, the country has noted that such actions can be potentially destabilizing to the region, and it continues to back measures to increase pressure against North Korea.
