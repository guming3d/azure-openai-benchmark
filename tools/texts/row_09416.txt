Chinese authorities have successfully moved a 12,000 ton, six-storey building just 38 metres. Developers needed the space as part of a 'face-lift' of the area, but they did not want to lose the Zhengguanghe Building in Shanghai which has become a local landmark. So they hatched a plan to move the red-bricked building to the edge of the block. Moving day: Chinese authorities have successfully moved a 12,000 ton, six-storey building just 38 metres . Face lift: As part of a 'face-lift' of the area, developers decided to save the six-storey red brick Zhengguanghe Building in Shanghai . Moving a structure as large as the building had never been attempted before in the city and it was projected to take 20 days. Shifting the 12,000 ton structure required the use of 12 lifting jacks, each capable of lifting 200 tons, on the eastern side of the building. This was supported by a further 16 on the southern side. Operation: Moving the 12,000 ton building required the use of 12 lifting jacks, each capable of lifting 200 tons . Popular landmark: The building was designed by British architect George Wilson and was completed in 1935 . The building was designed by British architect George Wilson and was completed in 1935. It has always been one of the historic landmarks of the city due to its strong British architecture style. It was originally used as the warehouse of the Zhengguanghe soda factory, but was named a valuable historical building in 1999. The foundations will be reinforced to ensure it stands the test of time. In 2012 a 122-year-old, 6,200 ton building in Zurich was moved 60 metres to make way for the expansion of a nearby railway. The Guinness Book of Records states: 'The heaviest building moved intact is the Fu Gang Building at West Bank Road Wuzhou, in the Guangxi Province of China. 'It was successfully relocated by the Guangzhou Luban Corporation on 10 November 2004.The building weighs 15,140.4 metric tonnes (33.3 million lb) and is 34 m (111 ft) tall. 'The building was moved 35.62 metres horizontally and it took eleven days to complete the relocation at a speed of around 30 centimetres an hour.' Checks: A workman checks the structure as the move is underway . Reinforced: The foundations will be reinforced, to ensure it stands the test of time .

chatgpt: In a stunning display of engineering prowess, a team of developers in China have managed to save the historic Zhengguanghe Building by lifting it off its foundations and moving it to a new location. The six-storey red brick building, which was constructed in 1935 after being designed by a British architect, had been slated for demolition due to urban development plans in the area. However, instead of succumbing to the wrecking ball, the developers decided to relocate the building to a new site where it could be preserved for future generations. This posed a significant challenge as the structure weighed approximately 6,000 tons and was too large to move in one piece. To solve this problem, the developers used 18 lifting jacks, each capable of lifting 200 tons, to raise the building off its foundations one section at a time. The process, which took several weeks to complete, required careful coordination and planning to ensure that the building was not damaged during the move. Despite the complexity of the operation, the developers were thrilled with the end result. Ma Yongjie, the project manager, praised the teamwork and ingenuity of the construction team, saying, "It was a very challenging project, but everyone worked together and we were able to successfully move the Zhengguanghe Building to its new home." The building, which is located in the city of Zhengzhou in central China, has a rich history and is considered a national landmark. It was once used as a tobacco factory and later served as a textile mill before falling into disuse. In recent years, there has been a push to revitalize the area and turn it into a cultural and artistic hub. The decision to save the Zhengguanghe Building is being hailed as a victory for historic preservation in China, where rapid urbanization and development have led to the destruction of many historic buildings and landmarks. Advocates for the preservation of China's cultural heritage hope that this project will inspire others to consider alternative solutions to demolition, such as relocation or adaptive reuse. The successful move of the Zhengguanghe Building also highlights the incredible advancements in construction technology that have been made in recent years. The use of lifting jacks to move heavy structures is a relatively new technique that has gained popularity in the past decade. It allows for buildings to be relocated without being dismantled, thereby preserving their historical and architectural value. Overall, the relocation of the Zhengguanghe Building is a remarkable achievement that demonstrates the power of human ingenuity and innovation. It is a testament to the importance of preserving our cultural heritage and ensuring that historic buildings and landmarks are protected for future generations to appreciate and enjoy.
