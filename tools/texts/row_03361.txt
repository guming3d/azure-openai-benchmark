article: The trial of three Al Jazeera journalists held on terrorism-related charges in Egypt was adjourned until May after the court on Tuesday viewed videos presented by the prosecution. Bail was again denied for correspondent Peter Greste, producer Mohamed Fahmy and producer Baher Mohamed, who have been in jail since December 29. The three were arrested at a Cairo hotel room and later charged with joining what the government says is a terrorist group -- the Muslim Brotherhood -- as well as broadcasting false information and working in Egypt without permits. Their case has drawn widespread international condemnation from human rights groups. The prosecution presented video and audio recordings and photos from the pool of material collected from the defendants' laptops, cameras and phones. The defense challenged the meaningfulness of the evidence. "These are very ordinary videos that don't come close to national security in accordance with the list of charges," lawyer Ibrahim Abdel Wahab told CNN. Fahmy told reporters during recess, "Every journalist has this on their computer. Why is this evidence?" Throughout Tuesday's seven-hour session, lawyers expressed frustration with the type of evidence accepted by the court as relevant. Following the display of a video on sheep herding and meat consumption, Fahmy's lawyer, Khaled Abu Bakr, told the court, "Put the sheep aside and cut the chase to the case. This is a waste of time." Many people in the courtroom, including journalists in attendance, found much of the video evidence inaudible. The judge disagreed. Tuesday's material was supposed to be what the prosecution saw as the most relevant to the case following an April 10 session in which random footage of Greste's work in Kenya and some Sky News Arabia reports dating back to 2012 were shown. Greste, an Australian who had worked in Egypt for three weeks when he was arrested in December, told reporters earlier this month that the evidence was "ludicrous" and "a joke." The trial comes as part of an intermittent crackdown on journalists. The Committee to Protect Journalists ranked Egypt as the third deadliest country for journalists in 2013. Reporters Without Borders said 80 journalists were arrested from July to September last year. Human rights groups have criticized the trial, saying the arrests indicate authorities in Egypt are stifling dissent and freedom of the press. Al Jazeera is a large news television and digital outlet with headquarters in Doha, Qatar.

chatgpt: The trial of three Al Jazeera journalists has been adjourned until May, following a contentious hearing in which the prosecution presented video of sheep herding and meat consumption as part of its case against the trio. The Egyptian government has accused the three journalists, Peter Greste, Baher Mohamed, and Mohamed Fahmy, of joining the Muslim Brotherhood, a banned organization in Egypt. The defense team, however, argued that the video evidence was irrelevant and called into question the prosecution's case. In a heated exchange with the prosecutor, defense lawyer Negad Al Borai said, "Put the sheep aside. This is a waste of time." The three journalists have been imprisoned for over a year, and their case has sparked worldwide condemnation and calls for their release. Al Jazeera called the adjournment "disappointing" and reiterated its demand for the release of its journalists. In a statement, the network said, "Al Jazeera continues to call for the release of our journalists, who have been unjustly imprisoned for over a year. We remain committed to journalistic integrity and the protection of our staff, and we will continue to cover the news in Egypt and around the world without fear or favor." The case has been widely criticized as a violation of press freedom and an attempt by the Egyptian government to silence dissenting voices. The Committee to Protect Journalists called for the charges against the journalists to be dropped and for their immediate release. "Journalism is not a crime, and these journalists should not have been arrested in the first place," said Sherif Mansour, CPJ's Middle East and North Africa program coordinator. "We call on the Egyptian government to drop all charges against these journalists and to release them immediately and unconditionally." The adjournment of the trial has cast doubt on the prospects for a swift resolution to the case. The journalists are expected to remain in prison for at least another month, as they await the resumption of their trial. The case has become a symbol of the struggle for press freedom in Egypt, and the outcome of the trial is being closely watched by journalists and human rights advocates around the world.
