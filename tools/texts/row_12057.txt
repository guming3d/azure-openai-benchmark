article: One of the four men arrested amid fears of a Remembrance Sunday terror plot had his passport cancelled after being stopped from travelling to Syria six months ago. Police seized 19-year-old Yousaf Syed’s passport, mobile phone and computer in a raid on his High Wycombe home as part of a probe into potential jihadis. He later received a letter from the Passport Office confirming his passport had been cancelled. Yousaf Syed who has been arrested amid fears of a Remembrance Sunday terror plot. He has links to the so-called Supermarket Jihadi Omar Hussain, pictured . It read: ‘You are a British national who has been involved in Islamist extremist activity. It is assessed in 2013 you intended to travel to Pakistan for extremist purposes. 'It is further assessed that you intended to travel again for extremist purposes in 2014. It is assessed you maintain your intention to travel overseas to participate in terrorist-related activities and such travel presents a risk to UK national security.’ On Thursday evening, Syed was again arrested by armed officers. The Mail on Sunday understands that a weapon – described as a ‘substantial find’ – was recovered from the home of one of his relatives. He and three other unnamed suspects from West London, aged 22, 25, and 27, are being questioned in Central London. Police are allowed to detain the men for a further seven days. Syed, a business studies student at Amersham & Wycombe College, lives with his mother and three siblings. It is understood that he married a 20-year-old woman in May. However, last night community leaders in High Wycombe claimed that Syed was treated ‘disproportionately’ in the initial raid in April, and alleged MI5 had been regularly contacting the teenager and ‘hassling him’ over the past two years. A disturbing image of Big Ben and Parliament exploding into flames was posted on Twitter last night by a notorious jihadi. Umar Shishani, pictured on the poster, who is fighting in Syria, also put up the message: ‘Soon! In all cities of the world.’ Syed attended the same mosque as British extremist Omar Hussain, who once threatened to ‘bomb the UK’. Hussain, a 27-year-old former supermarket security guard – who gave an extraordinary interview to the BBC in which he boasted about fighting with terrorists and laughed about beheadings – managed to travel to Syria to wage war despite being known to police. Further details about the alleged Remembrance Day terror plot have also emerged. Although there had been claims that a knife attack was to have taken place during the Queen’s visit to the Royal British Legion event last night, sources suggest the target may have been military personnel attending a lower-profile event.

chatgpt: Yousaf Syed, one of four men previously arrested in connection with a 'Remembrance Sunday plot' in the UK, had his passport cancelled after attempting to travel to Syria six months ago. New details also reveal that his mobile phone and computer were seized by authorities during a recent raid on his home. Syed, who claims to be a charity worker, was arrested again last Thursday by armed police officers in West London. Media reports have emerged linking Syed to Omar Hussain, a notorious British jihadist also known as the 'Supermarket Jihadi.' Hussain, who infamously worked at a British supermarket before joining ISIS in Syria, has been a prolific recruiter of British jihadists. He has been reported dead on multiple occasions but remains active on social media, encouraging others to join him in Syria. Syed's latest arrest appears to be part of an ongoing investigation into ISIS-linked terror plots in the UK. Few details have been released by authorities, but it is believed that the police are concerned about the possibility of further attacks. The UK has been on high alert for terror attacks since a spate of attacks in 2017, which left dozens dead and hundreds injured. ISIS has claimed responsibility for many of these attacks and continues to pose a significant threat to national security. The government has taken steps to combat terrorism, including introducing new legislation to monitor and prevent online radicalisation. However, the threat remains and additional measures may be needed to further protect the public. The recent discovery of Syed's connection to Hussain is a worrying development for authorities. Hussain has been described as one of the most dangerous British jihadists currently active in Syria. His ability to recruit and radicalise others has made him a major concern for security services. Syed, who is currently in custody and under investigation, represents another potential supporter of Hussain's violent ideology. This latest arrest highlights the ongoing threat posed by terrorism in the UK, and the urgent need for continued vigilance by authorities and the public. The UK's counter-terrorism strategy, known as CONTEST, focuses on four main areas: prevent, pursue, protect, and prepare. While it has been successful in preventing many attacks, more work is needed to further protect the public from the threat of terrorism. As the investigation into the alleged 'Remembrance Sunday' plot continues, authorities will be hoping that Syed can provide them with valuable information about the nature of the threat facing the UK. With Hussain still active and recruiters like him continuing to target vulnerable individuals, the fight against terrorism is more important than ever.
