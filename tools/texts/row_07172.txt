article: Maroua, Cameroon (CNN) -- Cameroon authorities have found six more bodies in flood waters, bringing the number killed to as high as 40 in the wake of tropical downpours and the breaching of a dam in the west African country. The inundation in the Far North Region has affected more than 26,000, officials said Thursday, and in neighboring Nigeria at least 15 deaths are blamed on waters rushing into the country from Cameroon's compromised Lagdo Dam on the Benoue River. Cameroon's Communication Minister Issa Tchiroma Bakary has described the flooding as "a calamity" and called for urgent action to save lives and property. Local officials are calling it the worst flood disaster in over 60 years. Water has submerged swaths of the North Region downstream, wiping out homes, farms and livestock, and Cameroon's government has dispatched a military contingency to assist and evacuate victims. Aid agencies Plan International Cameroon and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) fear infectious diseases - in particular cholera and malaria - could spread with the water, as is often the case. About 3,000 people have been hospitalized, and tents have been erected to house victims. In 2010, flooding in northern Cameroon triggered an outbreak of cholera that claimed nearly 6,000 lives, according to official estimates. Thousands of children are suffering from respiratory problems brought on by the flooding, and malaria infections among pregnant women are running high, according to Dr Alain Njiki of the UNFPA, which normally offers reproductive health services in Cameroon but has had to double as a medical aid agency since the flooding began. Food supplies are running low, boosting worries about malnutrition, and tent shelters are inadequate for the tens of thousands of displaced flood victims, said Demian Toh from the Red Cross. Cameroon's president Paul Biya and a delegation of ministers Thursday offered supplies and vaccination kits in UN camps for internally displaced persons. A flood victim in one camp who preferred anonymity said the government assistance is too small and sidelining thousands of families.

chatgpt: Cameroon is currently being hit with heavy rains, which are believed to be the worst in nearly a month. As a result of the constant downpour, homes and farmlands have been destroyed, causing many families to be without shelter or food. Livestock has also been lost in the floods. The situation took a turn for the worse when a dam fracture occurred, causing a nearby river to flood neighboring villages. Reports are now indicating that more bodies have been discovered floating in the floodwaters, with many people still missing. The deaths are being blamed on the dam fracture, which has caused significant harm to the surrounding communities. Emergency rescue teams have been working around the clock to locate and save any remaining individuals, but the heavy rain has made their efforts extremely challenging. Residents of affected communities have expressed their distress and disappointment at the lack of proper infrastructure to ensure the safety of their communities. Many have called for better flood prevention measures and an urgent review of the dam's safety measures. This is not the first time Cameroon has been hit with devastating floods. In 2018, floods caused by heavy rains submerged parts of the country, causing widespread damage and leaving many homeless. As global weather patterns change, the likelihood of more frequent and severe floods is expected to increase. As efforts to save lives continue, citizens of Cameroon are urging the government to take climate change seriously, and to invest in long-term strategies to mitigate the disastrous effects of future extreme weather events. In conclusion, the heavy rains and subsequent flooding in Cameroon have brought destruction, loss of life and livelihood. As a nation, Cameroon must prioritize investment in flood infrastructure, effective disaster response procedures, and take measures to mitigate the devastating effects of climate change on the country's citizens.
