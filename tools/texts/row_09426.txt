chatgpt: Chelsea FC's talisman Eden Hazard is reportedly on the verge of signing a new five-year deal with the London club. The Belgian winger has been in incredible form this season, leading his team's charge towards the top of the Premier League table. According to reports, the deal that Hazard is set to sign with the Blues is worth a staggering £300,000 per week. This would make him one of the highest-paid players in the Premier League, and a statement of Chelsea's intent to keep their talismanic winger for the foreseeable future. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has long been an admirer of Hazard's talents, and he believes that the Belgian can go on to become one of the greatest players in the club's history. "Eden is already one of the best players in the world, but he can become even better," Mourinho said. "He has all the qualities to become a Stamford Bridge great, but he will need to win titles for us to consider him a legend." Hazard has been key to Chelsea's success in recent years, helping them win the Premier League title in 2014/15 and leading the team to the FA Cup final last season. He has also been in incredible form this season, scoring seven goals and providing four assists in 13 Premier League appearances. The winger has been a constant thorn in the side of opposition defences, with his speed, skill and eye for a goal making him one of the most dangerous attacking players in the world. He has also shown incredible maturity and leadership on and off the pitch, and has become a fan favourite at Stamford Bridge. Hazard's new contract will come as a massive boost to Chelsea, who are looking to build a team capable of challenging for the Premier League title and other major trophies in the coming years. The club has made a number of high-profile signings in recent seasons, including Jorginho, Kepa Arrizabalaga and Christian Pulisic, and with Hazard's new deal in place, they will have one of the best attacking players in the world at their disposal for the foreseeable future. Chelsea are currently sitting in fourth place in the Premier League table, six points behind leaders Liverpool. However, with Hazard in their team, they will believe that they can mount a serious challenge for the title this season and in seasons to come. In conclusion, Chelsea fans will be relieved to hear that Hazard is set to stay at the club for the long-term. His new contract will be a statement of intent from the Blues, and a sign that they are committed to building a team capable of winning major trophies in the coming seasons. If Hazard can continue his incredible form and help his team win titles, he will surely go down as one of the greatest players in Chelsea's history.
