article: (CNN) -- Under CEO Marissa Mayer, Yahoo might still be trying to shed its image as a relic of the 1990s Internet era. But hey, it's getting a new logo! Yahoo announced Wednesday that it will unveil a new corporate logo September 4 -- the first such change since the company was founded 18 years ago. The new look will retain the current purple color scheme and, yes, its trademark exclamation point. Yodel away, Yahoo fans. "Over the past year, there's been a renewed sense of purpose and progress at Yahoo!, and we want everything we do to reflect this spirit of innovation," Chief Marketing Officer Kathy Savitt wrote in a blog post. "While the company is rapidly evolving, our logo â€” the essence of our brand â€” should too." To build some buzz around the new logo, the Internet company will display a different variation of the logo on its homepage and throughout its network in the United States for each of the next 30 days. The first example, shown above, opts for a more streamlined look, although the second "O" is larger than the first, reflecting -- in Yahoo's words -- the company's " fun, vibrant, and welcoming" character. The variations on the new logo -- this video clip offers a potential preview -- also will be showcased each day on Yahoo's Twitter account (#dailylogo). Mayer has been working to reinvent the struggling Yahoo since she took over leadership of the company in July of last year. In the past 12 months Yahoo has bought more than 16 startups, including the popular Tumblr blogging platform, and reinvigorated its older brands such as photo site Flickr. Under her reign, Yahoo's stock price has climbed from $15 to almost $30 (it's currently at $27), although some analysts remain skeptical about the company's long-term fortunes. Yahoo's rebranding follows similar logo changes by other aging Internet giants, including AOL, eBay and Microsoft. "The new logo will be a modern redesign that's more reflective of our reimagined design and new experiences," Savitt said.

chatgpt: Yahoo, the multi-national technology company, has announced a new logo design which is set to be unveiled on the 4th of September. The new design is said to pay homage to the company's strong legacy, while creating a fresh and modern look. Yahoo has confirmed that the new logo will still feature their trademark purple color and the famous exclamation point. According to sources familiar with the matter, Yahoo plans on displaying 30 different variations of the new logo in the days following the big reveal. This move is seen as a unique marketing strategy aimed at keeping Yahoo top-of-mind with consumers. The new logo comes at a pivotal moment for Yahoo, which is currently amidst a transitional period following its acquisition by Verizon. The company has been working to rejuvenate its brand, and this new logo is just one step in that process. Yahoo has had a strong following over the years, particularly amongst the tech community. The company, which was founded in 1994, was once the most visited website in the world and played a major role in shaping the early days of the internet. In recent years, however, Yahoo has struggled to adapt to the changing times, leading to declining revenues and a loss of relevance in the tech industry. In response to these challenges, Yahoo has been working hard to turn its fortunes around. In 2017, Verizon acquired Yahoo's core internet business for $4.48 billion. Since then, Yahoo has been working to rebuild its brand and re-ignite interest in its products and services. The new logo is expected to be another tool in Yahoo's arsenal as it continues down this path of reinvention. With its eye-catching design and commitment to retaining Yahoo's signature purple color and exclamation point, the company is sending a strong message to its users that it is ready for a fresh start. Overall, the unveiling of the new Yahoo logo promises to be a highly anticipated event for tech enthusiasts and casual users alike. With its combination of old-school charm and modern sensibility, Yahoo's new logo looks set to capture hearts and minds around the world. It remains to be seen, however, whether the new design will translate into increased consumer interest and financial success for the company in the long run.
