article: (CNN) -- Stephen Kiprotich was born 17 years after Uganda won its first Olympic gold medal. Fast forward another 23 years, and he has the honor of being the African nation's second athlete to triumph on sport's biggest stage. "I never saw John Akii-Bua run, but there are a lot of memories of him," Kiprotich told reporters after claiming a surprise victory in the men's marathon on the final day of London 2012. "I have been dreaming, 'Can I be like John Akii-Bua?' There is a time for everything, a time to train and a time to relax. I think today I joined the champions, so I am happy." The late Akii-Bua won Uganda's first Olympic gold at Munich '72, when he triumphed in the 400-meter hurdles. Leo Rwabwogo won boxing silver at the same Games, having won bronze four years earlier in Mexico when Eridadi Mukwanga took home silver. The greatest Olympic distance runner? But until Kiprotich's success on Sunday, its only other podiums were another runnerup placing in the ring for John Mugabi at Moscow '80 and bronze for 400m runner Davis Kamoga at Atlanta '96. Coached by Benjamin Longiross, who placed 62nd for Uganda in the marathon at Seoul '88, Kiprotich denied Kenya -- a country where he has trained in recent years -- a second successive men's title. Two-time world champion Abel Kirui had to make do with silver, while fellow Kenyan Wilson Kipsang claimed bronze. Kiprotich made his move after 38 of the 42 kilometers, bursting clear before taking a Ugandan flag from the crowd as he crossed the finish line in a time of two hours, eight minutes and one second. "When the race started I thought the Kenyans would win," Kiprotich said. "I kept in touch and then I thought, 'Let me move', so I moved. "When we came to within three miles, then I started to go on strongly." Kipsang, who won the London marathon in April, opened up a 21-second lead at one stage but later suffered in the hot conditions. "When Kipsang and I were together, I thought we were the only ones who would fight for the gold," said Kirui, who finished 26 seconds behind Kiprotich. "I thought I was going to sprint with Kipsang in the final kilometers. Surprisingly, I saw Stephen with us and it was difficult to make a move. "He stayed with us for a long time and he made a stronger move in the end. We were closing the gap but couldn't catch him. I am happy for him." The race also featured U.S.-based South Sudanese runner Guor Marial, who finished 47th after entering as an independent competitor.

chatgpt: Uganda has won its second gold medal in the history of the Olympics, and it comes from the men's marathon race held on Sunday. The East African nation's Stephen Kiprotich claimed the victory, triumphing 40 years after the late John Akii-Bua won the 400m hurdles in Munich. The win made Kiprotich the only other Ugandan to win Olympic gold ever since Akii-Bua's victory. Uganda's latest gold medal is also the first medal of any kind for the country since Davis Kamoga won silver at the Atlanta '96 Olympic Games. The victory is a major milestone for Uganda, which has struggled to make its mark in previous international events. In the men's marathon race, Kiprotich was up against two-time world champion Abel Kirui of Kenya and his compatriot Wilson Kipsang, who was running in the race as the world record holder. The Ugandan was not considered the favorite going into the event, but he showed tremendous grit and determination to eventually claim the gold medal. Kiprotich completed the 42.195km race in a time of 2 hours, 8 minutes, and 1 second, beating Kirui by a margin of 26 seconds. Kipsang was placed third with a time of 2 hours, 9 minutes, and 37 seconds. Speaking after the race, Kiprotich expressed his joy at making history and bringing Uganda's second Olympic gold medal. He thanked his coach and his family for their unwavering support, which helped him to prepare for this major event. Kirui, who won silver in the marathon event at the 2012 London Olympics, acknowledged Kiprotich's impressive performance, saying that he deserved the victory. Meanwhile, Kipsang, who was the favorite going into the race, failed to live up to expectations and finished third. In recent years, Uganda has made significant strides in the field of athletics, with top-performing athletes such as Joshua Cheptegei and Jacob Kiplimo leading the way. However, Kiprotich's victory in the men's marathon serves as a reminder of the country's history and the role that sport plays in bringing together the people of Uganda. The win is also significant in the context of the Olympic Games, where sports serve as a platform for global unity and cooperation. As the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, the victory serves as a testament to the resilience of athletes from all corners of the globe. In conclusion, Uganda's second Olympic gold medal, won by Stephen Kiprotich in the men's marathon race, is a historic moment for the country. The victory underscores the importance of sports in bringing people and nations together and is a testament to the resilience and dedication of athletes.
