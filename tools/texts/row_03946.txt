article: (EW.com) -- It's not an easy thing, to finish a movie without one of your lead actors. When Heath Ledger died midway through filming "The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus," director Terry Gilliam seized on the film's magical-real aesthetic and finished off the movie with Colin Farrell and Johnny Depp fake-Shemping Ledger. When Oliver Reed died before filming key scenes in "Gladiator," Ridley Scott pasted Reed's head onto a body double using digital effects. It's a tricky thing, morbid and money-grubbing but also well-intentioned and even a little sacred. You want to honor the dead actor's final work; but you also want to finish your movie. River Phoenix and Marilyn Monroe died too early to salvage "Dark Blood" or "Something's Got to Give;" a tragedy for many reasons, not least because they both looked much better than "The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus." Coroner: Car carrying Walker going 100-plus mph . So: "Fast & Furious 7." Paul Walker died in November with filming only half-finished, although given the age we live in fans had already seen Walker on set and in character. Cutting Walker out of the film entirely would have been a costly endeavor. Less cynically, you could argue that keeping Walker in the film was the right move. It would provide closure. And after all, the "Fast" franchise was something like Walker's life's work. But that opened up all kinds of creative problems for the Fast filmmakers â€” particularly since everyone attached to the film been proclaiming that "Fast 7" is an attempt at world-building towards a new trilogy. (Translation: They probably already had half-sketched plans for Brian O'Conner in Fast 10.) According to the Hollywood Reporter, the crew behind "Fast 7" has opted to "retire" Brian O'Conner. He will specifically not be killed off, according to the Reporter's sources. Universal had no comment on the report, but the rumor smells true. Given the high-speed nature of Paul Walker's death, it probably felt like bad taste to kill a character played by Walker in a movie about cars driving very fast. Still, it's difficult to imagine how O'Conner will leave the series. The franchise has a well-stated commitment to Family, and "Furious 6" reaffirmed the central tenet â€” sentimental, but full-hearted â€” that the characters will die for each other, even after they've ridden into several different last-big-score sunsets. We'll find out O'Conner's happy fate in April 2015. See the original story at EW.com. CLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly . © 2011 Entertainment Weekly and Time Inc.

chatgpt: The Fast and Furious franchise has been a cultural phenomenon since its debut in 2001. Its seventh installment, Furious 7, released in 2015, was a massive success, grossing over $1.5 billion worldwide. However, the production of the film was rocked by tragedy when lead actor Paul Walker died in a car accident midway through filming. The filmmakers were forced to reshuffle the script and use CGI to finish his scenes, but the question lingered: what would they do with Walker's character, Brian O'Conner, moving forward? Rumors and speculation have circulated over the years about how the franchise would handle Walker's absence. The eighth movie, The Fate of the Furious, was released in 2017 and featured brief mentions of Brian O'Conner, but the character did not appear onscreen. The filmmakers were faced with a difficult decision: retire the character or recast the role with a different actor. According to a recent report by Collider, the filmmakers have made the decision to retire Brian O'Conner from the Fast and Furious franchise. The report suggests that this decision was made long before the release of The Fate of the Furious and was not related to any potential plans for spin-offs or sequels. The decision was made out of respect for Walker and his family. Cutting Walker out of Furious 7 was not an option the filmmakers considered lightly. While the use of CGI was controversial, it allowed the production to continue with the character and honor Walker's legacy. However, the use of CGI for an entire movie would have been cost-prohibitive and possibly disrespectful to Walker's memory. Retiring the character may have been the best option for the franchise moving forward. Universal, the studio behind the Fast and Furious franchise, has declined to comment on the speculation about Brian O'Conner's retirement. However, this decision would align with statements made by the filmmakers in the past. In an interview with Screen Rant in 2016, producer Neal Moritz suggested that the franchise would move away from Brian O'Conner and focus on other characters. The Fast and Furious franchise has always been about family, and the decision to retire Brian O'Conner allows the filmmaking team to focus on the other members of this diverse and multi-talented group of characters. The upcoming ninth movie, F9, will see the return of several beloved characters, including Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez), and Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson), as well as new additions like John Cena's Jakob Toretto. While many fans may be sad to see Brian O'Conner go, the decision to retire the character seems like the right one for the franchise. With so many exciting new characters and storylines to explore, the Fast and Furious franchise is far from over. F9 is set to release in theaters on June 25, 2021, and fans can expect plenty of high-octane action, family drama, and heartfelt tributes to the franchise's history.
