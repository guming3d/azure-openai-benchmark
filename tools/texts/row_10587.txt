article: (CNN) -- A former exotic dancer has filed a lawsuit against Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, accusing him of sexual assault. In the suit filed Monday in Dallas County, Jana Weckerly claims that Jones assaulted her in 2009 and that the Dallas Cowboys knew about and covered up the incident. Weckerly is seeking "monetary relief of over $1,000,000," according to the suit. Reaction from the Cowboys was swift. Levi McCathern, an attorney representing the team, called the allegations "completely false" and "a shakedown." "The legal complaint is unsupported by facts or evidence of any kind," McCathern said in a written statement. "This is nothing more than an attempt to embarrass and extort Jerry Jones." Read the lawsuit . Weckerly's attorney says his client is in hiding. The suit claims that the 2009 incident caused the 27-year-old to fear for her life. In the aftermath, the suit says, Weckerly has suffered depression, dealt with substance abuse and has attempted suicide. The suit is not clear on exactly when the alleged assault occurred, saying it happened "sometime in May or June." But the suit alleges that the owner penetrated Weckerly with his fingers and forced her to touch his genitals without her consent. McCathern pledged to fight the complaint. He added that law enforcement is now involved "due to the seriousness of these baseless allegations." What if Roger Goodell ran the NBA and Adam Silver captained the NFL? The allegations against the Cowboys owner is the latest distraction for the NFL, pulling the spotlight from its early season games. Ravens running back Ray Rice was cut from the team and indefinitely suspended from the league this week after video surfaced showing the moment he delivered a punch to his then-fiancÃ©e that knocked her out. The league was ridiculed by some for initially suspending Rice for only two games, a position it did not change until after the video was made public. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said he does not rule out the possibility of Rice returning to the league someday. Another team owner, Jim Irsay of the Indianapolis Colts, is currently serving a six-game suspension and had to pay a $500,000 fine after pleading guilty to one misdemeanor count of operating a vehicle while intoxicated. The $500,000 fine is the maximum allowed under league rules. CNN's Jason Morris and Cristy Lenz contributed to this report.

chatgpt: A former exotic dancer named Jana Weckerly has filed a lawsuit against Jerry Jones, the owner of the Dallas Cowboys football team, seeking over $1 million in damages. Weckerly alleges that Jones sexually assaulted her back in 2009 by touching her genitals without consent. The lawsuit was filed in Dallas County, Texas earlier this week, and Weckerly's attorneys claim that they have video evidence that shows Jones in the act of assaulting their client. They also claim that Weckerly suffered emotional distress and lost income as a result of the assault. The attorneys for the Dallas Cowboys deny Weckerly's claims and have called them "completely false." In a statement released by the team's attorney, Levi McCathern, he said that "the allegations made by Ms. Weckerly against Mr. Jones are baseless and without merit." McCathern went on to say that he believes that Weckerly's lawsuit is an attempt to extort money from Jones, and that law enforcement has been involved in the case because of the seriousness of the allegations. "We are confident that this case will be resolved in favor of Mr. Jones, and we will vigorously defend him against these false accusations," McCathern said in the statement. This is not the first time that Jerry Jones has been accused of inappropriate behavior with women. In 2014, he was photographed with a woman who was not his wife, and there were rumors that he had paid her to keep quiet about their relationship. Jones has faced criticism for his handling of the NFL's domestic violence policy in the past as well. In 2014, he was accused of being lenient with Greg Hardy, a player who was convicted of domestic violence and served a four-game suspension. Jones has not yet commented on Weckerly's lawsuit, and it is unclear whether he will face any disciplinary action from the NFL if the allegations are proven to be true. Regardless of the outcome of the lawsuit, it is clear that the allegations against Jones will have an impact on the Dallas Cowboys and their fan base. The team is preparing for the upcoming NFL season, and Jones is currently in negotiations with the league over a new collective bargaining agreement. It remains to be seen how this lawsuit will affect those negotiations, but many are speculating that it could have a major impact on the future of the NFL and its policies regarding sexual assault and harassment.
