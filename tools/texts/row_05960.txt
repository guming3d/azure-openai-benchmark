article: An Oxford student threw up during an English Language lecture about the origin of the words 'lash' and 'Jagermeister'. The unfortunately-timed incident sparked an amused reaction yesterday at the 928-year-old university after disrupting the end of an etymology talk. Professor Charlotte Brewer, an expert on the Oxford English Dictionary, was discussing colloquialisms including 'lord of lash', 'prince of pulls', 'banter' and 'Jägermeister'. It seemed it was all too much for a female first-year undergraduate, who vomited on the floor. Been on the lash? The incident happened as Prof Charlotte Brewer discussed the origins of drinking 'banter' Aftermath: The scene after the unfortunately-timed incident, which prompted predictable student mirth . The unidentifed student has since been nicknamed 'chundergraduate' by Oxford student tabloid The Tab. One English undergraduate told the newspaper: 'It was hilarious because the whole room one-by-one became aware of it like a domino effect. 'She looked horrified and was frantically asking for tissues. I'm not sure if she was hungover or not, but she certainly looked green around the gills.' The lecturer who was giving the talk, Professor Charlotte Brewer, is an expert on the history of the Oxford English Dictionary and how each edition reflects the time in which it was written. Her lecture yesterday afternoon had turned to the origin of words found in the spoof Agony Lad column of The Oxford Student, an undergraduate-led magazine. Expert: Prof Brewer, who gave the lecture, studies changes to the dictionary printed in the ancient city (above) The anonymous author describes himself as the 'lord of lash, baron of banter and prince of pulling', adding: 'There are plenty of ladies out there who know me very… intimately. 'If you want to be one of those lucky customers, head to where the drinking is fiercest, follow the smell of Jägermeister, and I’ll be there.' Sadly for the student journalists, they were unable to establish conclusively whether their fellow undergraduate was hungover or simply ill. One student added: 'The Agony Lad column isn't sufficiently vile as to cause vomiting. 'She probably just went a bit hard the night before.'

chatgpt: An unexpected incident caused quite a stir at an elite university recently, sparking amusement and debate over the definition of college "banter." Etymology expert Professor Charlotte Brewer was in the middle of a discussion on the topic when an unfortunately-timed incident occurred. According to reports, an unidentified first-year student became the subject of a nickname coined by the university's student paper. The moniker in question? "Chundergraduate." The term, which is a play on words combining the word "undergraduate" with an Australian slang term for vomiting, quickly caught on among the student body and sparked plenty of giggles and eye-rolls. While some students found the nickname humorous and harmless, others were quick to point out the problematic nature of such language. As Prof Brewer noted, "It's important for us to recognize that what we consider to be 'just banter' can have real consequences for those on the receiving end." The incident has led to a wider conversation surrounding the use of derogatory or insensitive language, especially in the context of educational institutions where students from diverse backgrounds are expected to coexist and collaborate. Some have argued that this particular incident highlights the need for increased sensitivity training and awareness on college campuses. Despite the more serious undertones of the conversation, many students continue to find the nickname amusing, and it remains to be seen whether it will continue to catch on or be phased out over time. Either way, the incident serves as a reminder of the power of language and the importance of considering the impact our words can have on others. In response to the incident, the university issued a statement reminding students of the importance of treating each other with respect and consideration, both in-person and online. They also pledged to continue working towards fostering a more inclusive and welcoming environment for all students, regardless of background or identity. Overall, the incident has sparked an important and ongoing discussion about the role of language in shaping our perceptions of others and the impact that seemingly harmless jokes and nicknames can have on those around us. As Prof Brewer noted, "We all have a responsibility to think carefully about the words we use and the impact they can have. Let's use this incident as a teachable moment and work towards creating a more positive and inclusive college experience for all."
