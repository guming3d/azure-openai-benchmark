With expenses scandals still fresh in the mind, cash for questions dominating headlines, and first-class perks all paid for by the taxpayer, it is perhaps not surprising that MPs are not held in the highest regard by voters. In fact a major poll has confirmed the image that most MPs are only in politics to line their own pockets, revealing that four in five voters do not trust MPs and believe that they put their own interests before others. The Ipsos MORI survey reveals deep levels of cynicism towards politicians in general, although 51 per cent of respondents said they trusted their local MP. A major poll has confirmed the image that most MPs are only in politics to line their own pockets . Public confidence in elected representatives has been declining in recent years, and is markedly lower than in similar surveys in 2004 and 2006. But it has recovered slightly since its low point in 2009 during the MPs’ expenses scandal, when 76 per cent of those questioned did not trust MPs to tell the truth. Now 72 per cent concur – up from 60 per cent in 2006 – while 21 per cent said they did trust them to be honest. As to what the priorities of MPs are, half of the British public (52 per cent) believe they put their own interests first, and 31 per cent say that they put their party first. Only one in 12 (8 per cent ) believe MPs put the interests of their own constituents first, and 6 per cent said their country comes first for MPs. Half of the British public believe MPs put their own interests first, according to a new Ipsos MORI survey . Unfortunately this is almost the exact opposite of what people want MPs to prioritise, with 56 per cent saying they want them to put their country first while 40 per cent want the constituent put first. Supporters of the UK Independence Party were more likely than other party supporters to think MPs put their own interests first (72 per cent), to not trust MPs in general or their local MP, and were also most dissatisfied with the three main party leaders. Gideon Skinner, head of political research at Ipsos MORI, said: ‘Public cynicism with politics is nothing new, but it looks like it has become entrenched. ‘Disenchantment with politicians is shared across supporters of all parties – but is noticeably higher among UKIP voters, who seem most unhappy with the current political scene.’

chatgpt: A new Ipsos MORI survey has unearthed deep levels of cynicism towards politicians as public confidence in elected representatives continues to decline. According to the survey, half of the British public believes MPs put their own interests first, with many citizens becoming increasingly disillusioned with the public officials who represent them. The survey, which questioned over 1,000 adults in the UK, found that only 19 percent of respondents believed that MPs put the interests of the public first. This figure is a worrying sign for politicians who need the support of the public to carry out their responsibilities effectively. Moreover, disillusionment with politicians has risen to unprecedented levels of mistrust, with 52 percent of respondents believing that politicians lie to the public, and only 26 percent of people feeling that they can trust politicians to deal responsibly with important issues.  The decline in public confidence in politicians has been a long-term trend. It has been demonstrated by declining voter turnout levels and increasing anxiety over the influence of big businesses on the political process.  Politicians have been aware of this trend for some time and have taken steps to try and counteract it. They have introduced measures aimed at reducing the influence of big business on the political process, such as tighter controls on political donations and the introduction of a lobbyist register, but there are still many who doubt whether these measures will be enough. One major factor influencing the public's view of politicians is the perception that MPs are out of touch with ordinary people. The recent expenses scandal, which revealed numerous cases of MPs claiming public funds for personal expenses, further eroded public trust. The survey by Ipsos MORI suggests that the public's skepticism towards politicians is not limited to politicians' expenses. It suggests a deep-seated distrust of politicians and an ingrained sense that politicians are not honest about their motives. Politicians are not the only public officials to suffer from these trust issues, however. The survey found that only 33 percent of respondents trusted the judiciary to act in the public's best interests, and only 16 percent believed that the media was doing a good job in holding politicians to account. In conclusion, politicians face a serious challenge in rebuilding public trust. They will need to prove that they are committed to acting in the public interest and to put in place measures to minimize the influence of big business and restore public faith in the political process. Until then, it seems likely that many in the public will remain deeply skeptical towards politicians and their motives.
