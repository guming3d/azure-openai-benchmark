article: By . Emma Glanfield for MailOnline . Cheryl Burnside, 30, posed as a stripogram to gain entry to a block of flats in Halifax, West Yorkshire, before forcing a 71-year-old man to hand over money . A con artist who tricked her way into a vulnerable pensioner's home by posing as a stripogram before forcing him to hand over cash after stripping down to her bra and knickers has been jailed. Cheryl Burnside, 30, conned her way into a block of flats in Halifax, West Yorkshire, by claiming to be a stripogram for a 'Mr Johnson'. However, when she gained entry to the complex she persuaded a 71-year-old man to let her into his home so she could use the toilet. Burnside, who was addicted to drink and drugs for several years, took off her dress as she told her victim that she had been booked as a stripogram for £70. Prosecutor John Topham told Bradford Crown Court on Thursday that she was wearing only a bra and a thong when the man offered to give her £20 just to leave. However, Burnside said she wanted more money and then pretended to make a phone call to her boyfriend suggesting that he should come to the flat because the man was refusing to pay up. Before leaving the flat she grabbed a pair of trousers which contained a few pounds and the man's keys, but she was later linked to the crime after leaving her fingerprints on a cigarette packet. The court heard that she committed the offence just days after being given a community sentence for shoplifting. Mr Topham told the court how four months earlier Burnside had targeted another pensioner, in his 80s, who had previously helped her out with money. She turned up at his Halifax home just after midnight and when he refused to give her any money she took his wallet with £60 in it. The court heard that Burnside denied being involved in that offence in February and was on bail when she stole the second man's property in June. Bradford Crown Court heard how it was the second time Burnside had targeted a pensioner for cash and the judge jailed her for three years for the 'despicable' crimes after she pleaded guilty to two charges of theft . She was originally charged with two offences of burglary, but when her case was listed for trial last month she pleaded guilty to two charges of theft. Her guilty pleas spared the two pensioners from having to give evidence in court. Judge Jonathan Rose described the crimes as 'despicable' and said Burnside had targeted her victims because of their age. He jailed her for three years and imposed an indefinite restraining order banning her from contacting her first victim.

chatgpt: A woman who posed as a stripogram to gain access to a flat complex tricked and then robbed a 71-year-old man. Cheryl Burnside, 30, persuaded the man to let her into his home in Bradford by pretending to be a stripogram. However, instead of performing, she demanded cash from the pensioner. The man gave her £20 with the hopes she would leave, but Burnside demanded more before finally fleeing. Bradford Crown Court heard that this was not the first time Burnside had targeted a pensioner in this manner, as police said she had carried out a similar crime before. During her hearing, Burnside admitted to one count of burglary and one count of robbery. The Judge handed her a three-year community order with drug rehabilitation requirements, 80 hours of unpaid work and a six-month curfew. In court, Burnside's defence team argued that she had a difficult life, endured a lack of parental support, and was battling drug addiction, which pushed her to commit her crimes. The court heard how she had grown up in a "dysfunctional" family setting, with her father jailed and her mother addicted to heroin. The pensioner, who was home alone at the time of the crime, said the incident has left him feeling "anxious and unsafe" in his own home. He added that he had never felt scared in the area before, but now he feels very different. Speaking to reporters outside the court, a police spokesperson described the crime as "a despicable and cowardly act," and said that nobody should have to experience such a terrifying ordeal. The police warned members of the public to stay vigilant and be wary of anyone acting suspiciously, particularly if they claim to be a stripogram. The police advise residents to remember to not let strangers into their homes without verifying their identity and to report any suspicious activity to the authorities. With the rise of impersonation crimes, police are urging the public to be cautious and mindful, particularly of those who take advantage of the elderly or most vulnerable members of society. The public is advised to report all suspicious activity, particularly with regard to fraud or scams, to their local police. In conclusion, the sentencing of Cheryl Burnside demonstrates the severity of impersonation crimes and how they affect their victims' lives. To prevent these incidents from occurring, the public must remain vigilant, stay cautious, and use common sense when interacting with strangers.  It is essential for people to verify the identify of individuals who claim to be a service provider or stripogram performer before allowing them into their homes.
