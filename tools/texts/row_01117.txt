article: It is news that will be welcome to anyone infuriated by Stephen Fry’s incessant swearing during the Baftas awards ceremony last weekend. The broadcaster says he is going to fall silent. The 57-year-old who is known both for his verbosity and as a prolific tweeter, broke the news of his self-imposed silence to his eight million Twitter followers yesterday. Stephen Fry, left, has announced that he is taking a holiday from Twitter for 'a while', right . The Tweet linked to his own website where he explained the reason behind his decision . He wrote: ‘Dearest Twitter followers and other interested (or bored) parties. Just a quick note to say that I’m going to be away until May. During that time I will be taking a holiday from Twitter and, with a few exceptions, not tweeting at all.’ The star said that a few automatic tweets would still appear, but that it would not mean he was logging on or monitoring his Twitter feed. Fry, who announced his recent marriage to his 27-year-old partner Elliott Spencer on the social media site, signed off: ‘Well, off I go. Have a wonderful time without me. I know you will.’ Fry faced criticism for swearing and making sexual references while presenting last weekend’s Baftas at the Royal Opera House. The recorded version of the night was broadcast on BBC1 at 9pm on Sunday, and prompted a number of complaints. Last month, Fry revealed his plans for his travels with Spencer, saying: ‘We’re delaying our honeymoon until after the Baftas so I can relax for longer. We’re planning a huge adventure. ‘We’re going to start in Cuba because it’s one of my favourite countries in the world and we’ve got a romantic hideaway. And then we’ll go to about three or four more countries.’ Fry added: ‘I’m very happy. We both are.’ Mr Fry, right, has recently announced his marriage to husband Elliott Spencer, left, on the social media site .

chatgpt: Stephen Fry, the well-known comedian and actor, has announced that he is taking a break from Twitter. The 57-year-old star, who enjoys a massive following of eight million users, has revealed that he will not be returning from his hiatus until May. Despite this, he has scheduled automatic tweets to keep his followers engaged during his absence. Fry, who has previously spoken about the impact of social media on his mental health, spoke candidly about his decision to take a break. He explained that he felt it was time to "have a holiday from the notifications, the brouhaha, the arguments, and the noise." He also stressed that he would not be monitoring his Twitter feed during his hiatus. The announcement came as a surprise to many of Fry's fans, who are used to interacting with the star on the platform. However, it is not the first time that Fry has taken a break from social media. In 2012, he left Twitter for two years, citing his desire to take a break from the negativity and hostility that can often be found on the site. Despite this, Fry has always been an active voice on social media, using his platform to share his thoughts on a variety of topics, from politics to popular culture. He has also been open about his struggles with mental health, and has used his platform to raise awareness of the issue and to encourage others to seek help when they need it. Fry's decision to take a break from Twitter has been met with mixed reactions from his followers. While some have expressed disappointment at his absence, others have voiced their support for his decision to prioritize his mental health. Regardless of the response, one thing is clear: Stephen Fry is taking control of his social media presence, and is actively putting his mental health first. As he takes his hiatus from Twitter, his followers will be waiting eagerly for his return in May, and looking forward to his continued contributions to the platform.
