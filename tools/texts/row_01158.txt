article: London, England (CNN) -- Union members representing British Airways cabin crew announced Friday they will hold two separate strikes this month in a dispute over working conditions. The first strike will last three days from March 20, and the next will last four days from March 27, said Len McCluskey, the assistant general secretary of the Unite union. There will be no strikes over the Easter period, he said. Further strikes could be called if needed, he said. Will a British Airways strike impact you? "Regrettably, management turned down a remarkable offer," McCluskey said. British Airways, which lost hundreds of million dollars last year, responded by saying it is "extremely disappointed" with the union's decision. "We are very sorry for the stress and disruption Unite's decision will cause," the airline said in a statement. "We are currently considering our response to this strike threat and what action we will need to take to minimize disruption." The industrial action is over planned changes to cabin crew conditions, which BA says will save the carrier more than 60 million pounds ($91 million) a year. Unite has said the plans call for working hours to be extended and crew levels to be cut, changes that it has said will damage customer service and the BA brand. The two sides have been holding talks to avoid strikes. BA management submitted a formal offer to the union Thursday, Unite said, but added that the offer fails to address union concerns about crew numbers and service delivery. That prompted Unite officials to announce the strike dates. There is still a chance the strikes could be averted. Unite said union members will be able to vote on BA's offer on the first day of the planned strikes, and if they vote to approve it, the strikes will be canceled. British Airways declined to share details of its offer with CNN. "Unite's action has no shred of justification," the airline said. "British Airways' crew are rightly renowned for their professionalism and skills. Our entire package for crew recognizes that and is reasonable and fair." BA said all union proposals so far would save the airline "significantly" less money than BA's own planned changes. "In addition, Unite's plans would cut crew pay and allowances," BA said. "The reductions required to generate sufficient savings would leave each crew member between 1,000 and 2,700 pounds ($1,516 and $4,095) a year worse off. These proposals lack credibility, and Unite did not inform crew of them when it asked them to vote for a strike." In December, a judge blocked a planned 12-day strike by Unite over the same issues that would have started just before Christmas.

chatgpt: British Airways passengers may experience travel disruptions as the airline's cabin crew are set to go on strike on two separate occasions over the next two weeks. The first strike is scheduled to last three days, starting on March 20, and the second will last four days, starting on March 27. The airline says it will do everything possible to minimize disruptions during the strikes. However, there's some good news for BA's customers over the Easter break, as no further strikes have been scheduled during that time. The gap in the striking period could provide a window of opportunity for the airline to negotiate with the union in a bid to avoid future walkouts. The Unite union, which represents BA's cabin crew, has been trying to negotiate with the airline over pay and benefits as part of a new collective bargaining agreement. The union is concerned that BA's proposed changes would damage both customer service and the airline's brand. The proposed changes include a new pay structure and benefits package for cabin crew who started serving BA after 2010. However, BA has disputed the Unite union's claims, stating that the union's proposals would save the airline less money than its own changes. The airline also pointed out that it has already made concessions to Unite, such as a pay rise of 7% over three years. The upcoming strikes have prompted BA to cancel a number of flights and rebook passengers on other flights. The airline has also offered affected passengers the option to either rebook their flights for a later date or get a full refund. Despite these disruptions, BA has assured its passengers that it will do everything possible to ensure that their travel plans are not severely impacted. The airline has urged all passengers to check the status of their flights before heading to the airport. Should the planned strikes go ahead, they will be the first to hit BA's cabin crew since 2010. The airline has been involved in a number of labour disputes in recent years, including one with its pilots last year, which saw the airline cancel almost all of its flights for two days. BA has apologized to its customers for any inconvenience caused by the upcoming strikes and has expressed its hope that a resolution can be found before any further disruption occurs.
