The world No 3 revealed his decision after suffering defeat to 17-year-old Borna Coric in the quarter-finals of the Swiss Indoors on Friday. Nadal had pulled out of next week's Paris Masters earlier in the day and later announced that he was bringing his season to a close in order to undergo surgery on November 3. Rafael Nadal acknowledges the crowd as his season ends with defeat in the quarter-finals in Basle . Borna Coric, the 17-year-old Croatian wildcard, celebrates after sealing victory against world No 3 Nadal . He said: ‘It is the day to say goodbye for the season. I am not going to play in next week’s Paris Masters or in London. I am not competitive enough to do that. ‘It has been a very hard year for me mentally and physically too. ‘I tried to practise to try to get fit but it was not possible. It’s difficult to play and compete when you’re not able to practise weeks in a row. ‘I’m not a player who competes to try to be in quarter-finals. I try to win tournaments. I will be back at the start of 2015.’ Nadal had followed a course of antibiotics after being diagnosed with appendicitis ahead of the Shanghai Masters earlier this month.

The 28-year-old surprised some observers by competing in Basle this week and he struggled on court on Friday night, losing 6-2, 7-6 (4) to the Croatian teenage wildcard. Coric was just three points away from claiming a first-set bagel but Nadal reeled off two games in a row before Coric finally sealed the set. Nadal battled back in the second set and forced his young opponent to serve to stay in the set twice. Coric duly held his nerve and claimed victory on the first of two match points in the second set tiebreak as Nadal pushed a forehand wide. Nadal's withdrawal from the season-ending event is a boost for the qualification hopes of Andy Murray, who currently sits just inside the Race to London cut at No 8.

chatgpt: Rafael Nadal, one of the most prominent tennis players in the world, has announced his withdrawal from the upcoming ATP World Tour Finals that is scheduled to be held in November. This has come as a big disappointment to his fans all over the world, who were eagerly waiting to see him in action once again. The reason for Nadal's withdrawal is his deteriorating health condition. The Spanish tennis star has decided to undergo an emergency appendix surgery on November 3, which has forced him to pull out of the tournament. This news has sent shockwaves across the tennis community as he was considered to be one of the favorites to win the ATP World Tour Finals. Nadal's sudden withdrawal from the tournament has certainly raised concerns about his fitness levels. He suffered a painful defeat at the hands of 17-year-old Borna Coric in the quarter-finals of the ATP Swiss Indoors held in Basle on Friday. Nadal looked far from his best in the match and seemed to be struggling with his health throughout the encounter. Nadal's injury concerns have been mounting over the months, and this decision to undergo surgery has come as a huge blow to his hopes of returning to full fitness. The appendix surgery is a complex and invasive procedure that will take some time to recover from. Nadal will have to focus on his rehabilitation and recovery if he is to have any chance of returning to the top of the game. In a statement, Nadal said, "I am very disappointed that I will not be able to compete at the ATP Finals in London. I have been struggling with my health for the last few weeks, and the appendix surgery is a necessary step in my recovery. I hope to be back on the court as soon as possible and looking forward to competing again." The ATP World Tour Finals is the year-end championship series event featuring the top eight players from the ATP rankings. The tournament is scheduled to be held in London from November 15 to November 22. Nadal's withdrawal will come as a huge blow to the organizers, who were hoping to have all the top players participate in the event. Nadal's absence from the ATP World Tour Finals will also give his rivals a chance to close the gap on him in the rankings. Novak Djokovic, the world No 1, is already leading the rankings with Roger Federer at No 2. Nadal has slipped to No 3 due to his recent injury concerns, and this latest setback will only make it harder for him to climb back up the rankings. The tennis world will surely miss Rafael Nadal's presence in the upcoming ATP World Tour Finals. His withdrawal is a reminder that health comes first and that athletes need to prioritize their well-being above everything else. We wish him a speedy recovery and hope to see him back on the court soon.
