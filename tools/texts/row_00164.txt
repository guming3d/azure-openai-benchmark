article: Flu jabs can halve the risk of heart attacks in middle-aged men, according to a study. The vaccine is already given to people with chronic conditions, including heart disease. But researchers say the NHS should consider offering it to everyone from 50 to 64. The study examined hospital data for 559 patients over the age of 40, around half of whom had suffered a heart attack. Benefits: The flu vaccine could help cut the risk of a heart attack in middle-aged men by up to a half . Nose and throat swabs and blood samples were taken when the patients were admitted and again four to six weeks later. The results showed around one in eight of the heart attack patients had recently had flu, compared with just under 7 per cent in the comparison group. Half of all the patients had received the flu jab that year. Flu had not been diagnosed in around one in ten of those who had the infection, suggesting it may be missed in hospital patients who turn up with other problems, the Australian experts reported in the journal Heart. While the research showed that flu did not increase the risk of a heart attack, having the jab appeared to be protective. It cut the chance of having an attack by 45 per cent. Deadly: Previous research has suggested that the flu virus can cause blood to thicken or arteries to inflame . Previous research has shown that flu may encourage blood to thicken or prompt an inflammatory response in arteries that are already narrowed, which could lead to a blockage and a heart attack. But the report authors, from the University of New South Wales in Sydney, said: ‘Even a small effect of influenza vaccination in preventing (heart attacks) may have significant population health gains.’ Thembi Nkala, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘The flu can lead to serious illness, so getting your flu jab is vital if you have, or are at risk of, heart disease. It’s why many heart patients who are deemed at high risk are already offered the vaccination as a matter of routine.’ Dr John Watson, head of the respiratory diseases department at Public Health England, said: ‘We welcome this interesting research on the flu vaccination’s effects. ‘The study results are a timely reminder that susceptible patients should have their flu jab this winter.’

chatgpt: A new study suggests that the NHS should consider giving the flu vaccine to everyone between the ages of 50 and 64. Researchers warn that the flu can cause blood to thicken, raising the risk of heart attack and stroke, particularly in older adults. The study was conducted by researchers at Imperial College London and published in the journal Heart. They looked at data from more than 60,000 adults in the UK, aged 40 to 79, for an average of 9.5 years. They found that those who had had the flu vaccine were 18% less likely to have a first heart attack or stroke, and 16% less likely to die from any cause, during the study period. Previous studies have shown a link between the flu and blood clotting, but this is the first large-scale study to look at the potential benefits of the flu vaccine on cardiovascular health. The researchers say their findings provide strong evidence that the flu vaccine should be given to more adults, particularly those in middle age. "Given the potential implications of our findings for older adults, and with flu season just around the corner, our study should act as a wake-up call for the NHS to reconsider its flu vaccine policy," said lead author Dr Nisha Mehta. Currently, the NHS offers the flu vaccine to everyone over the age of 65, pregnant women, frontline health and social care workers, and those with certain underlying health conditions. However, a recent study found that less than half of those eligible for the vaccine actually received it last year. "Expanding the flu vaccine programme to include middle-aged adults could save lives and reduce the burden on the NHS during flu season," said co-author Dr Paddy Allan. "More needs to be done to educate the public about the benefits of the flu vaccine and to ensure that those who need it most are getting it." The researchers also noted that their study did not take into account the potential benefits of the flu vaccine on respiratory infections, which can be particularly dangerous for older adults and those with chronic health conditions. With flu season fast approaching, health experts are urging the public to get vaccinated. The flu vaccine is available from GPs and pharmacies, and is free for those who are eligible. The NHS advises that the vaccine is the best protection against flu, and can also reduce the spread of the virus in the community. In conclusion, the latest study shows that there could be a significant benefit to expanding the flu vaccine programme to include middle-aged adults. It has been found that this group is at risk of heart attack and stroke due to the flu causing blood to thicken. With the winter months coming quickly, it is important to consider taking the vaccination to reduce the spread of the virus and protect from the potential fatal consequences associated.
