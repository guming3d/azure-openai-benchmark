article: (CNN) -- This week a Russian foundry minted a new coin to mark Russia's "reunification" with Ukraine's Crimea region. Vladimir Putin's portrait was on one side, and a map of Crimea on the other. Many, especially outside Russia, would dispute the use of the word "reunification." But few would dispute that the coin's symbolism goes way beyond Russian patriotism over a small Black Sea peninsula. Many Russians, particularly those who remember life in the Soviet times, and under former President Boris Yeltsin, see the mark of Putin on all of their coins. When he took over the presidency in the final hours of the last millennium, Russia was licking some serious wounds from the crash of 1998. In its World Economic Outlook in October 1999, the IMF observed: "Continuing economic and political uncertainties have led to further capital flight and a sharp decline in foreign investment." Ring any bells? Putin set about treating those wounds. He slashed income and corporate tax and cut red tape. Aided by rising oil prices, growth climbed sharply, averaging 7% over the next eight years. Russians had money and the opportunity to make more. High-end shops started to appear in Moscow and St. Petersburg, and many people travelled overseas. Prosperity and stability were prized above all else. Even democracy. 14 years later, the latest World Economic Outlook from the IMF contained unnerving parallels to 1999. Russian growth prospects were downgraded because of "geopolitical risks". The IMF noted that "Investment had already been weak, reflecting in part policy uncertainty." Standard and Poor's echoed that on Friday as it cut Russia's credit rating to one level above junk. To call this full circle would be far too optimistic. In 1999 Russia was already coming out of a decline when Putin took the reins. Now it may be on a slippery slope. While the economy is insulated by an estimated $477 billion in foreign currency reserves, sanctions could still hit hard, and there's a bigger problem: perception. Andrei Konoplyanik, an advisor to Gazprom Export, says he is worried ratings downgrades and lowered forecasts "immediately create additional nervousness in the investment community." Russia may not need foreign approval, but it does need foreign money. In a 2008 speech laying out Russia's goals up to 2020, Putin said: "I stress that we have no intention of trying to take anything away from anyone else. We are a self-sufficient country. And we have no intention of closing ourselves off from the outside world and living in isolation." It turns out he does -- but is Putin prepared to sacrifice whatever economic stability Russia has left in the process? READ MORE: Obama: World must unite to isolate Russia .

chatgpt: Russia has minted a new commemorative coin to celebrate what it calls its "reunification" with Ukraine's Crimea region. The coin features Russian President Vladimir Putin on one side, and a map of Crimea on the other. The move is sure to anger Ukraine, which has accused Russia of illegally annexing Crimea in 2014. The announcement of the new coin comes at a time when Russia's involvement in Ukraine's ongoing crisis is seriously hurting its economy. Standard and Poor's, one of the world's leading credit rating agencies, cut Russia's credit rating to one level above junk on Friday. The downgrade was due to Russia's continued involvement in Ukraine as well as the impact of Western sanctions and falling oil prices on its economy. The commemorative coin is not just a symbolic gesture, but a clear signal of Russia's intentions to continue its aggressive policies towards Ukraine. Moscow has dismissed Western criticism of its annexation of Crimea as "hypocrisy" and argues that the predominantly ethnic Russian population of Crimea sought protection against the new Ukrainian authorities that came to power in 2014. However, Russian claims that the annexation was a response to a legitimate popular demand for reunification with Russia are not recognized internationally, and Ukraine has condemned the move as an act of aggression. Kiev has also accused Russia of supporting separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine, a claim that Moscow denies. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has taken a toll on Russia's economy, which is heavily reliant on oil exports. Falling oil prices have led to a steep drop in the value of the Russian ruble, while Western sanctions have targeted key sectors such as energy, finance, and defense. The sanctions have made it difficult for Russian businesses to access foreign capital and technology, and have contributed to a sharp drop in foreign investment. The economic situation has been compounded by the coronavirus pandemic, which has caused a sharp contraction in global demand and disrupted supply chains. Russia's economy is expected to contract by around 5 percent this year, despite the government's efforts to support the economy through fiscal and monetary measures. The commemorative coin is unlikely to do much to shore up Russia's economy, but it may be viewed as a symbolic gesture of defiance against Western pressure. Russia has been increasingly assertive in its foreign policy over the past decade, and the annexation of Crimea was a clear signal that Moscow is willing to use force to protect its interests. However, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine has led to a deterioration in Russia's relations with the West, and has made it more difficult for Moscow to achieve its strategic goals. The new commemorative coin may be seen as a reminder of Russia's imperial ambitions, but it also highlights the mounting economic costs of its aggressive policies.
