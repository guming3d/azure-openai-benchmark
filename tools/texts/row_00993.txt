article: Gamblers who won $1.5 million at a casino after realizing the cards hadn't been shuffled have been ordered to return the money. State Superior Court Judge Donna Taylor has sided with the Golden Nugget casino in its long-running dispute with 14 gamblers who say the fault wasn't theirs and they should be allowed to keep their winnings. At issue were games of mini-baccarat played in April 2012 using decks of cards the casino had paid a manufacturer to pre-shuffle but that hadn't been shuffled. Once players realized the pattern in which the cards were emerging they drastically upped their bets from $10 a hand to $5,000 and won 41 straight hands. Bummer: Gamblers who won $1.5 million at the Golden Nugget in Atlantic City after realizing the cards hadn't been shuffled have been ordered to return the money . In the ruling, issued Monday and publicized by the casino on Thursday, the judge determined the games were illegal under state law because they didn't conform to gambling regulations specifying the way each game must be played. 'The dealer did not pre-shuffle the cards immediately prior to the commencement of play, and the cards were not pre-shuffled in accordance with any regulation,' the judge wrote. 'Thus, a literal reading of the regulations ... entails that the game violated the (Casino Control) Act, and consequently was not authorized.' She ruled that the gamblers must return any cash paid to them by the casino and any outstanding chips in their possession. The casino in turn must refund the gamblers the money they first put up to play. The Golden Nugget was pleased with the court's ruling, casino general manager Tom Pohlman said. 'We believe it was the right decision,' he said. A lawyer for the gamblers did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment on the decision. A lawyer for the casino's partner, Landry's Inc., said he expects the decision to be appealed. The Golden Nugget bought what were supposed to be pre-shuffled cards from a Kansas City manufacturer, which acknowledged in court it failed to shuffle them. The casino said its litigation with the manufacturer has been resolved but a confidentiality agreement prevents it from revealing details. The judge's ruling was the latest in a long series of decisions that have seesawed between favoring the casino and favoring the gamblers. The owner of the casino, Texas billionaire Tillman Fertitta, originally decided to let the players keep their winnings, but that offer was contingent on them dropping other claims they made against the casino, which they declined to do. The casino paid out about $500,000 in winnings for the disputed games. About $1 million in chips remains outstanding.

chatgpt: In a recent decision by a New Jersey judge, games of mini-baccarat played at the Golden Nugget in 2012 were ruled as illegal. At the center of the controversy were pre-shuffled cards that had not actually been shuffled, allowing players to take advantage of the pattern in which the cards were emerging. The Golden Nugget had paid a manufacturer to pre-shuffle the cards, but due to a flaw in the procedure, the cards were not properly randomized. Once players realized this, they began upping their bets from the initial $10 per hand to a massive $5,000 per hand. These high-stakes bets paid off handsomely, with the players winning an incredible 41 straight hands. However, Judge Donna Taylor determined that the games were illegal under state law because they did not conform to state gambling regulations. The pre-shuffled cards gave the players an unfair advantage, violating the spirit of fair play that is at the heart of all gambling regulations. This ruling has major implications for the Golden Nugget and for the wider gambling industry. The Golden Nugget is left with no choice but to pay out the millions of dollars in winnings to the players who took advantage of the flawed card shuffling process. But beyond the financial impact of this ruling, there are broader questions about how casinos can ensure fairness in their games. The Golden Nugget had taken steps to pre-shuffle the cards to make the game more efficient and speed up play. But in doing so, they inadvertently created a situation where players had an unfair advantage. The case also raises questions about whether the Golden Nugget should have taken action once it became clear that the cards were not being properly shuffled. While it's understandable that the casino may have wanted to avoid stopping play and disrupting the gaming experience for patrons, allowing the flawed shuffle process to continue ultimately led to major losses. In the aftermath of this ruling, it's likely that there will be increased scrutiny of gaming procedures and security measures in casinos across the state. For players, this could lead to a greater sense of confidence that the games they are playing are fair and above-board. For the Golden Nugget, this ruling serves as a stark reminder of the importance of adhering to gambling regulations and ensuring that fairness is maintained in all games. While the financial implications of this decision are significant, the long-term implications for the casino's reputation and credibility could be even more profound.
