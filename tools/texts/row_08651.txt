article: DALLAS, Texas (CNN) -- If you turn to the Bible -- Isaiah Chapter 35, Verse 8 -- you will see a passage that in part says, "A highway shall be there, and a road, and it shall be called the Highway of Holiness." Churchgoers in six states have held prayer sessions along the side of Interstate 35. Now, is it possible that this "highway" mentioned in Chapter 35 is actually Interstate 35 that runs through six U.S. states, from southern Texas to northern Minnesota? Some Christians have faith that is indeed the case. It was with that interesting belief in mind that we decided to head to Texas, the southernmost state in the I-35 corridor, to do a story about a prayer campaign called "Light the Highway." Churchgoers in all six states recently finished 35 days of praying alongside Interstate 35, but the prayers are still continuing. Some of the faithful believe that in order to fulfill the prophecy of I-35 being the "holy" highway, it needs some intensive prayer first. So we watched as about 25 fervent and enthusiastic Christians prayed on the the interstate's shoulder in Dallas. They chanted loudly and vibrantly, making many people in the neighborhood wonder what was going on. They prayed that adult businesses along the corridor would "see the light" and perhaps close down. They prayed for safety and freedom from crime for people who lived along the interstate. They prayed that all Americans would accept Jesus into their lives.  Watch believers offer prayers Â» . The woman who came up with the concept of "Light the Highway" is a Texas minister named Cindy Jacobs. She says she can't be sure Interstate 35 really is what is mentioned in the Bible but says she received a revelation to start this campaign after "once again reading Isaiah, Chapter 35." Jacobs also points out that perhaps there is a link between the area near this highway and tragedies that have happened in history, such as the bridge collapse on I-35 in Minneapolis last August and the assassination of JFK 44 years ago near I-35 in Dallas. That's why prayer certainly can't hurt, she adds. Now, it's only fair to say most people, the religious and the non-religious alike, don't buy any of this, but none more than the owners of some of the adult businesses along I-35. At an adult go-go club, the owner tells us he resents people trying to impose their will on others. And he says his club holds fundraisers, food drives and toy drives to help the community. But on the side of the road, the prayerful aren't going to change their minds. Holy highways and nude clubs, they believe, are not a combination God has in mind. E-mail to a friend .

chatgpt: Interstate 35, commonly referred to as I-35, is a major highway in the United States that runs from southern Texas to northern Minnesota. It connects major cities such as Dallas, Oklahoma City, Kansas City, and Minneapolis. However, some people see a deeper connection between I-35 and the Bible. Believers, mainly Christians, have been known to pray by the side of the highway, with some even claiming that I-35 has Biblical significance. They note that I-35 runs through six states: Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, and Minnesota, and that the number six is often associated with imperfection or incomplete creation in the Bible. A spokesperson for the Church of God, one of the denominations that has encouraged members to pray on I-35, said that "the highway is a symbol of the journey we all take in life, and the need to stay close to God's guidance and protection as we travel." Others believe that the placement of I-35 is no coincidence, and that it was divinely inspired. "God has a plan for everything," said Pastor David Peterson of the First Baptist Church of Edmond, Oklahoma. "I-35 is not just a random road, but a part of God's plan for our nation." The idea of connecting highways to religion is not new. The famous Route 66, which runs from Chicago to California, has been romanticized as the "Mother Road" and a symbol of the American Dream. Some have even seen it as a metaphor for the path to salvation. However, not everyone sees the connection between I-35 and the Bible. Some see it as a stretch to make a religious connection to a highway that was created for practical purposes, such as transportation and commerce. Despite the debate, the phenomenon of praying on I-35 continues. Many believers feel that the act brings them closer to God and helps to keep them safe on their journeys. It is not uncommon to see groups gathered by the side of the highway, holding hands and bowing their heads in prayer. The debate over whether or not I-35 has spiritual significance will likely continue for years to come. However, for those who believe, it will remain a powerful symbol of their faith and a reminder of the importance of staying close to God.
