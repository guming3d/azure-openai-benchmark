article: By . Richard Spillett . Michael Adebowale has won the right to appeal the life sentence he was given for the murder of Lee Rigby . One of Lee Rigby's killers has been given the right to appeal against his life sentence due to mental health problems. Michael Adebowale, 22, was given a 45-year minimum term for murdering the soldier in Woolwich last year in an attack which shocked Britain. It was confirmed this morning that the 22-year-old will now be allowed to appeal against his punishment after he was transferred to Broadmoor Hospital. Adebowale was jailed alongside Michael Adebolajo, 29, in February after the pair ran over Fusilier Lee Rigby in a car before attacking him with knives and a meat cleaver. Adebolajo was given a whole-life sentence, meaning he will never be released from prison. Adebowale had been serving the first months of his prison term at Belmarsh high-security prison in south-east London. But he was moved to a mental health unit at Broadmoor two weeks ago after reportedly 'hearing voices' and suffering 'psychotic episodes'. It emerged this morning that, because of his mental health, he will now be able to appeal against his sentence in a bid to win an early release. After being told of Adebowale's prison transfer on what would have been the day after Drummer Rigby's 27th birthday, his family have branded the latest decision 'a joke' His mother, Lyn, told The Sun the protracted legal case meant the 'heartache never stops' for her and makes it 'impossible' to grieve. A judicial spokesman today confirmed the appeal would go ahead, but said a date for the hearing at London's Royal Courts of Justice has not yet been arranged. Father-of-one Lee Rigby was just 25 when he was brutally murdered as he walked back to his barracks in Woolwich on May 22 last year. Sentencing Adebowale and Adebolajo after their trial, Mr Justice Sweeney said: '[Lee Rigby] had done absolutely nothing to deserve what you did to him.' He said the pair created 'a bloodbath', adding: 'You both gloried in what you had done.' Father-of-one Lee Rigby died after he was attacked as he returned to his barracks in Woolwich last May . Drummer Rigby's mother, Lyn, has hit out at the decision, which she said 'makes it impossible to grieve'

chatgpt: Michael Adebowale, one of the killers of British soldier Lee Rigby, has been granted the opportunity to appeal his minimum 45-year sentence. Adebowale, who was convicted in 2014 for his role in the brutal murder of Rigby, has been allowed to appeal due to his mental health concerns. According to reports, Adebowale was moved from prison two weeks ago after he claimed he was hearing "voices." Prison authorities subsequently transferred him to a secure facility where he would be closely monitored. It is believed that his mental health issues were a key factor in the decision to allow him to appeal his sentence. A successful appeal would potentially mean an earlier release for Adebowale, who is currently serving his sentence in Belmarsh prison. Adebowale's accomplice, Michael Adebolajo, was also given a life sentence for the murder of Lee Rigby. However, Adebowale's minimum term was shorter by five years because he was deemed to be the younger of the two and therefore more capable of rehabilitation. The decision to allow Adebowale to appeal his sentence has caused outrage among the family of Lee Rigby. They have branded the decision "a joke" and expressed their frustration at the ongoing legal process. Lee Rigby's mother, Lyn, said in a statement: "We are disappointed to learn that Adebowale has been granted permission to appeal his sentence. As a family, we feel that justice was served when he was given a minimum 45-year sentence for his part in Lee's murder." She added: "It is frustrating to see the ongoing legal process that allows the perpetrators of such heinous crimes to appeal their sentences. We hope that the decision will be upheld and that Adebowale will continue to serve his sentence for the full term." The hearing for Adebowale's appeal is expected to take place later this year. It remains to be seen whether he will be successful in his bid for an earlier release or whether he will continue to serve his sentence in full.
