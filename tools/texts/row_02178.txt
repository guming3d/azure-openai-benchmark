article: Hong Kong (CNN) -- A huge manhunt involving soldiers and police is underway in China for an elusive armed robber who is thought to be behind a string of murders dating back to 2004. The search for 42-year-old Zhou Kehua -- one of the country's most wanted criminals -- is focused on the southwestern city of Chongqing, China's biggest metropolis, after a woman was shot dead and two others injured on Friday morning outside a bank during an attempted robbery, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Later that day, local police reported that a railway policeman was killed while in pursuit of a man believed to be Zhou -- his tenth victim in eight years following a series of robberies in Chongqing, Nanjing and Changsha. All his victims were shot in the head, according to media reports, while police say he targeted people withdrawing money from banks. Chongqing authorities recalled officers on vacation as they launched a full-scale search for the fugitive in mountainous areas around the city, Xinhua said. Police and military units from Hunan and Jiangsu provinces were also mobilized. The search uncovered a cave that Zhou is believed to have stayed in, China Daily reported. Inside were two cigarette cases, a T-shirt and human waste, the report added. Police have said Zhou is an expert at survival in the wild, though there is no record of him serving in the military. According to China Daily, the Ministry of Public Security has classified Zhou as a "class-A" suspect, with a total 5.4 million yuan (US$849,000) in rewards being offered for information leading to his capture. A huge -- but ultimately fruitless -- search for Zhou was carried out in January this year after he allegedly shot and robbed a man who had just withdrawn 200,000 yuan ($31,700) from a bank in Nanjing before fleeing in a car. Nanjing Public Security Bureau's Xuanwu district office told CNN at the time that more than 80,000 police officers took part in the manhunt. It also published two video clips online of the suspect escaping the scene. Authorities have warned people against attempting to confront Zhou as he is considered "ruthless and highly dangerous," Xinhua said. China increases bounty for deadly robber .

chatgpt: The search for Zhou Kehua, one of China's most wanted criminals, has intensified in the city of Chongqing. Zhou has been accused of killing ten people during a series of attempted robberies since 2004. The 42-year old criminal escaped a similar manhunt in Nanjing in January after a man was shot during a robbery. Zhou's violent history has earned him a "class-A" suspect status, and the public has been warned not to approach him. The police have been on Zhou's trail for years, but have yet to capture him. Zhou's crimes have been particularly gruesome, and his methods have left people terrified. He is known to target people carrying large sums of money and to use violent force to carry out his crimes. In one instance, he shot and killed a man in broad daylight in an attempt to rob him. The police have placed a price on his head, offering 5 million yuan (about $781,000) for anyone who can provide information leading to his capture. The authorities have also increased security measures in the city of Chongqing and have deployed additional police officers to search for him. Residents have been urged to remain vigilant and to report any suspicious activity to the authorities. Schools and offices have also been advised to heighten their security measures. Zhou's latest escape has further highlighted the challenges faced by the Chinese authorities in capturing high-profile criminals. Despite the government's efforts to crack down on crime and maintain order, the country continues to face challenges in reducing crime rates. Zhou's crimes have also raised concerns about the effectiveness of China's legal system in deterring such crimes. Some argue that China's laws are too lenient on criminals, which has led to a rise in crimes such as robbery and murder. The hunt for Zhou Kehua is still ongoing, and the authorities remain committed to bringing him to justice. The public has been urged to stay vigilant and to report any information they may have on his whereabouts. Zhou's capture would be a significant achievement for the Chinese police, and would likely bring some relief to the citizens of Chongqing.
