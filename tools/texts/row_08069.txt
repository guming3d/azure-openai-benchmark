article: By . Fiona Macrae Science Correspondent . Learning from others: Chimps learn how to peel and break into fruit from watching others, scientists found . It is not just humans who are fascinated by watching others cook – chimps also pick up tips on how to prepare food. A study found that just as people learn new cookery techniques by watching celebrity chefs, chimps learn how to crack and peel fruit by studying their companions. Researcher Bruce Rawlings said: ‘It is almost like they are watching the top chef and picking up information.’ Learning from others is an important part of building up cultural traditions – an ability thought of as being fundamentally human. However, the Portsmouth University research suggests that it may actually date back more than six million years, to the time when chimps and humans shared a common ancestor. The researchers videoed three groups of chimps as they were fed hard-shelled fruit in a Zambian wildlife orphanage. The creatures used six different techniques to access the fruit’s flesh, including cracking two fruits together, banging the fruit on the ground and taking a small bite to get the peeling process started. The favoured techniques differed across the groups. For instance, the banging two fruits together was used by two of the groups but not a third. Each group contained members from around Africa, meaning their behaviour couldn’ t be explained by genetics. And as the various groups couldn’t see each other and they weren’t taught how to eat the fruit by their keepers, it is thought that they were learning through observing others – a key part of establishing cultural traditions and differences. Mr Rawlings, a psychologist, said: ‘Culture is a hallmark of the human species. Watch and learn: Humans learn how to cook from watching celebrity chefs like Jamie Oliver, pictured. It seems the technique can also be observed in chimps linking the species . ‘As humans we might learn the best way to crack a nut or stone a peach form watching someone lese and it appears chimpanzees learn how to handle their food in similar ways.’ The study, published in the journal Animal Cognition, also revealed that some of the chimps stockpiled peeled fruit to eat later. The self-control and mental ‘time-travel’ involved in planning a future meal suggest the creatures are capable of complex thought.

chatgpt: A recent study published in the journal PeerJ reveals that chimpanzees have the capability to learn about preparing food from observing their peers. Conducted by a team of researchers from Portsmouth University, the study sheds light on the social learning abilities of the animals. To better understand the learning strategies of chimpanzees, the researchers set up a unique experiment. They introduced three pairs of chimpanzees to a feeding platform with easily accessible apples. These three pairs then watched a fourth pair of chimpanzees who had been trained to prepare more difficult-to-obtain fruit through a series of actions, such as washing, peeling or cracking the fruit. The researchers filmed the interactions between the chimpanzees and carefully analyzed the data. They found that, after observing their peers, the other chimpanzees were able to learn different food preparation techniques, such as washing or peeling the fruit. The researchers also noted that the chimps who had learned new techniques through observation retained their skills over time. "Chimpanzees are known for their incredible intelligence, but this study highlights their social learning abilities," said Dr. Erica van de Waal, co-author of the study. "This means that social observation can greatly contribute to their skillset, not just for food preparation, but for other activities as well." The study also highlighted the social dynamics and relationships between the chimpanzees, which played a major role in their ability to learn from one another. "The chimpanzees observe one another and are often more likely to learn from someone they have a good relationship with," said van de Waal, "which is similar to how people learn from one another." The ability of chimpanzees to learn from one another is not only relevant to our understanding of their behavior, but can also have important implications for the conservation of their species. As natural habitats become increasingly threatened, chimpanzees in the wild may need to adapt to new food sources and environments. Knowing how chimpanzees learn from one another can provide conservationists with valuable insights into ways to help the animals survive in changing conditions. "We hope that our study can contribute to a better understanding of the social learning abilities of chimpanzees, and ultimately help to protect this endangered species," said van de Waal. The study highlights one aspect of the complex behaviors and intelligence of chimpanzees. As research in this area continues to expand, scientists are gaining a deeper understanding of these fascinating creatures and the ways in which they learn and evolve.
