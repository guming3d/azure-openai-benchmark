It seems that Paula Deen isn't the only member of her family that can't keep out of trouble. Her brother, Earl 'Bubba' Hiers, who owns Uncle Bubba's Seafood & Oyster House in Savannah, Georgia, received a less than stellar public health inspection report for his restaurant, with violations that included inadequate hand washing facilities for staff and not keeping some foods at the right cold temperature. Two of the violations during the Feb. 7 visit from health inspectors was for repeat offenses, according to the official report posted by Radar Online.

With the latter violation, the food in . question was thrown out and the problem corrected during the visit. Overall, Uncle Bubba's received a score of 83 out of 100, which is considered a 'B' rating by the Georgia Department of Public Health. Scores between 70 and 79 are given a 'C.' However, the restaurant's cleanliness score has dropped since its prior inspection on Nov. 6, 2013, when it scored a 90, earning an 'A' rating. Bubba may want to seek the advice of her sister when it comes to keeping a restaurant more in line with health codes. Paula Deen's Savannah restaurant, Lady & Sons, was visited by health inspectors on Feb. 4, and earned a near perfect score of 98, an 'A' rating. She lost two points for a couple of relatively minor violations. One was for not keeping salad bar plates and bowls properly covered which could lead to contamination and the other was for not having test strips available at a sanitizer sink at the bar station.

chatgpt: Uncle Bubba's Seafood & Oyster House, a restaurant in Savannah, Georgia that Paula Deen helped start, has received a "B" rating of 83 out of 100. The rating was given following an inspection of the establishment, where various violations were noted. Although the rating is not terrible, it is a significant downgrade from the restaurant's previous "A" rating. Uncle Bubba's Seafood & Oyster House has been at the center of attention for several years now, as it was the site of a lawsuit filed against Paula Deen and her brother, Bubba Hiers, by one of the restaurant's managers. The lawsuit alleged that Deen and Hiers had made racial slurs in the workplace, and it contributed to the downfall of the restaurant. The lawsuit was ultimately dismissed last year due to lack of evidence. Despite the previous issues, Uncle Bubba's Seafood & Oyster House had recently been growing in popularity, even after it was revealed that Deen had used racial slurs in her personal life. However, it seems that the restaurant's success may be slowing down now that it has received a lower rating. It's worth noting that Deen's own restaurant, Lady & Sons, received a "A" rating of 98 during a recent inspection. This highlights the disparity between the two restaurants owned by the celebrity chef. There has been no word from Paula Deen or her team regarding the rating downgrade. However, a spokesperson for the restaurant has stated that they are taking the necessary steps to address the violations that were listed in the inspection report. The violations found during the inspection include problems with the restaurant's equipment and cleanliness. For example, the inspection report stated that Uncle Bubba's Seafood & Oyster House had failed to clean and sanitize their ice maker properly. Additionally, there were issues with the temperature of the food throughout the establishment, which presents a serious health risk to customers. Given the issues found in the inspection report, it's clear that Uncle Bubba's Seafood & Oyster House will need to improve in several areas if it wants to regain its "A" rating. With the restaurant's recent controversies, a "B" rating may not necessarily harm business. But with the ongoing competition in Savannah's restaurant scene, it will be important for the establishment to stay on top of their game. In conclusion, Uncle Bubba's Seafood & Oyster House received a "B" rating of 83 out of 100 following an inspection of the establishment. The rating follows previous violations, and contrasts sharply with Paula Deen's own Savannah restaurant, Lady & Sons, which received an "A" rating of 98. While the restaurant's issues may not necessarily harm its business, it's clear that there is room for improvement if Uncle Bubba's Seafood & Oyster House wants to regain its "A" rating and maintain its position in Savannah's competitive restaurant industry.
