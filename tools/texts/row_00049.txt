article: (CNN) -- Officials in Costa Rica worked Friday to mop up the damage after heavy rain and mud slides buried homes and killed at least 23 people in the Central American country, authorities said. Crews have found at least 20 people who were buried alive Thursday after pounding rains sent mud rushing over at least five homes in San Antonio de Escazu, a suburb of the nation's capital, the Costa Rica National Commission for Emergencies said. Several people were still reported missing there Friday, while three people were found dead in San Marcos de Tarrazu, a city in the central part of the country, said CNE. Another 2,639 people have sought refuge in 46 shelters, the commission said. President Laura Chinchilla has declared a state of emergency and said that Friday and Saturday would be national days of mourning. She visited an affected area in San Antonio de Escazu Friday to offer her support to the families missing loved ones. Images airing on CNN affiliate Teletica showed rescue crews digging through demolished homes. In another scene, workers at a mud-covered overturned vehicle spread a white sheet over a victim's body. Other images showed buckled roads damaged by the ferocity of the rushing water. In another area, some residents strung up a rope between two banks so people could hold on to it and walk across rushing water. Mud slides and flooding were reported in many places in the Central Valley area, which is surrounded by a handful of mountains and volcanoes. It is the most populous part of the nation. Classes were indefinitely canceled at many of Costa Rica's public schools, the education minister said on Teletica. About 800,000 people were left without safe water supplies, and residents were told to boil any water to be used for drinking or cooking.

chatgpt: In the aftermath of the heavy rainfall and flooding that has been affecting San Marcos de Tarrazu, three more people were found dead on Wednesday. This brings the total number of fatalities to six, with several others still missing. The flooding has also heavily impacted the infrastructure in the region. Numerous homes have been demolished, and roads have been washed away, making transportation difficult. As a result, the government has set up 46 shelters across the region, which have provided refuge for thousands of affected citizens. The government has called for a state of emergency in the region and has deployed emergency personnel to provide aid and assistance to those affected. Rescue operations are ongoing, with search parties combing the flooded areas for survivors and those still missing. The flooding in San Marcos de Tarrazu is a result of heavy rainfall that caused rivers to overflow and lead to flash floods, landslides, and mudslides. The flooding has also led to extensive damage to some of the crops in the region, which might lead to food shortages in the coming days. Authorities are urging the citizens of San Marcos de Tarrazu to follow safety protocols and stay in shelters or safe locations until the situation improves. The government has also set up a hotline for citizens to report any incidents or request assistance. This is not the first time that San Marcos de Tarrazu has experienced flooding. In 2018, floods and landslides caused by heavy rainfall also led to numerous deaths and significant property damage. The government is now working to clean up the affected regions and restore essential services, including road networks and utilities. Citizens are urged to stay vigilant and keep themselves and their families safe as the region recovers from this natural disaster.
