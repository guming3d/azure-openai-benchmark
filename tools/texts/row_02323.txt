chatgpt: Former Manchester United Star Arrested for Assaulting Two Women Former Manchester United star, Ravel Morrison, was arrested yesterday after allegedly assaulting two women outside a bar in Manchester. The 21-year-old has been charged with two counts of common assault and is set to remain in custody until Thursday. According to reports, Morrison attacked 19-year-old Reah Mansoor and her mother, 39-year-old Parveen Mansoor, outside a bar in Manchester on July 27th. The incident reportedly occurred after the two women got into an argument with the West Ham United midfielder. Morrison, who currently plays for West Ham in London, allegedly assaulted both women before fleeing the scene. He was later arrested and charged with two counts of common assault. He appeared in court yesterday and was remanded in custody until next Thursday. The 21-year-old footballer, who is believed to earn around £15,000 a week at West Ham, has had a troubled career so far. Morrison has been in trouble with the law on several occasions, and his career has been marred by allegations of drug use and poor behavior. Morrison began his career at Manchester United, where he was regarded as one of the club's most promising young players. However, his off-field issues led to his departure from the club in 2012, and he has since had spells at a number of clubs, including Birmingham City, Lazio, and Ostersunds FK. West Ham signed Morrison in 2019, but he has struggled to make an impact at the club. He has made just eight appearances for the Hammers since his arrival, and his future at the club is now uncertain. The incident is the latest in a string of high-profile cases involving footballers and violence against women. Earlier this year, Liverpool FC's Mohamed Salah and Everton FC's Gylfi Sigurdsson were both criticized for their involvement in a charity football match against a team accused of promoting rape and sexual assault. Footballers are often seen as role models for young people, and incidents like this are a cause for concern. It is important for clubs and players to take responsibility for their actions and to be held accountable for any wrongdoing. The case against Morrison will be heard in court next Thursday. It remains to be seen what the outcome will be, but this incident is sure to damage his reputation and further harm his already fragile career.
