article: Daley Blind will join Manchester United for £14million as Louis van Gaal makes his final moves to improve a desperately poor Manchester United side, who were held to a 0-0 draw at Burnley on Saturday and have yet to win this season. The Ajax left-sided defender will have a medical in Manchester with personal terms and the fee between the clubs agreed. Van Gaal has now spent £160 million this summer — with no immediate improvement in the team — almost as much as the club have spent in total over the previous five years. Blind, the son of former Ajax captain Danny, was a key player in Holland’s run to the World Cup semi-finals under Van Gaal and understands the back-three system with which the team are struggling.

Tottenham are ready to push United to sell Danny Welbeck for £12m but have been told that United are loathe to help out a likely rival for Champions League qualification.

He claimed that the problems over paperwork with £15m signing Marcos Rojo, 24, would be resolved during the international break. The player has a permit but also needs a visa and the Home Office has insisted Rojo must be interviewed by the Madrid consulate because of an altercation with a neighbour in Argentina in 2010. He was never prosecuted but the case was reopened in May. Rojo does not have a criminal record but it is likely that embassy officials are checking the details before processing the visa. Van Gaal said: ‘I expect by the time we play QPR, he will be playing.’

chatgpt: Manchester United have confirmed the signing of Ajax's versatile defender Daley Blind for a fee of £13.8 million. Blind successfully underwent a medical in Manchester on Saturday before signing a four-year contract with the club. Blind, who can play in a number of positions including left-back, centre-back and defensive midfield, was not included in the Ajax squad that faced Groningen on Sunday, providing further evidence of his imminent move to Old Trafford. The 24-year-old Dutchman's arrival at United follows the summer signings of Angel di Maria, Marcos Rojo, Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw as new manager Louis van Gaal continues to revamp his squad. Blind's experience at both club and international level will be valuable for the Red Devils, who have struggled defensively so far this season. The son of former Netherlands international defender Danny Blind, Daley began his career at Ajax's renowned youth academy before breaking into the first team in 2009. He helped the Amsterdam club win four Eredivisie titles, three Dutch Cups and reach the 2017 Europa League final, where they lost to Manchester United. Blind can play in a variety of positions, a trait that will be particularly useful given Van Gaal's preference for defensive flexibility. His versatility was evident during the 2014 World Cup, where he was a key member of the Dutch side that reached the semi-finals. On the international stage, Blind has won 54 caps for the Netherlands since making his debut in 2013. He was a regular starter for his country during their impressive run in Brazil earlier this summer and was also named Dutch Footballer of the Year for the 2013-14 season. Blind's decision to join Manchester United speaks volumes about his ambition and desire to play for one of Europe's elite clubs. United have had a disappointing start to the Premier League season, losing two of their first three matches, but the arrival of Blind is sure to boost morale at Old Trafford. Van Gaal is renowned for his tactical astuteness, and Blind's arrival should provide him with added flexibility and options at the back. With fixtures against Queens Park Rangers and Leicester City coming up after the international break, United will be hoping to kick-start their season with some positive results. In conclusion, Manchester United's acquisition of Daley Blind from Ajax for a fee of £13.8 million is a solid addition to Louis van Gaal's squad. Blind's versatility and experience will be valuable assets for United, who are aiming to break back into the Premier League's top four this season. With the transfer window now closed, Van Gaal will be hoping his summer signings can hit the ground running and provide a platform for future success at the club.
