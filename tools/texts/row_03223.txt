chatgpt: The Sayreville War Memorial High School's football coaching staff was suspended with pay by the Board of Education on Tuesday evening. This decision was made following the shocking hazing and sexual assault allegations involving seven of the school's football players. Reports indicate that upperclassmen on the team were targeting younger players on a daily basis. The accusations are deeply concerning, and officials were quick to take action. Following the suspension of the football coaching staff, the Board of Education has also banned the Sayreville football program for the rest of the 2014 season. This means that the remaining five games on the football schedule will not be played. During the meeting on Tuesday evening, many adults who were present in the audience defended the coaches and blamed the Board of Education. They argued that the coaches had no knowledge of the hazing and sexual assault allegations and should not be punished for the players' actions. However, the board decided to take action against the coaching staff, as they believe that they should have been aware of the situation and taken preventative measures. The hazing and sexual assault allegations have sparked outrage in the community, with many people calling for justice and accountability. The school district has launched an investigation into the incident, and the seven players involved in the allegations have been suspended.
