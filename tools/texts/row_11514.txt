article: Slashing rest days, a new fines system, players treated like kids — Ben Foster has lifted the lid on the Tony Pulis regime at West Bromwich Albion, and insists he’s loving it. According to the England goalkeeper, the secret to West Brom’s revival is Pulis’s insistence on hard work by all, raising fitness levels, and a refusal to give an inch at training. West Brom beat Birmingham courtesy of Victor Anichebe’s brace to make it three wins and a draw since Pulis took charge. And Foster said: ‘If I was a manager, I would be like him. You’ve got to treat football players like kids sometimes. If you give them an inch they will take a mile — it’s amazing. VIDEO Scroll down to see what Ben Foster will no longer be getting away with at West Brom . Tony Pulis continued his West Brom revival with a 1-0 win over Birmingham in the FA Cup . Ben Foster is loving life under new manager Pulis, who he feels is improving the work ethic of the team . ‘He’s on us and it’s what we needed. It is old-fashioned graft but it is great. He lets nobody slack off. ‘Everybody is training to their maximum every day and looking sharper. You can see the difference. ‘We get Sunday off, which is a nice family day, but in the week it’s hard work and it’s a big step up from what we have been doing in recent years. I really like it. Maybe before, coming in on a Monday, you could have taken it easy. Nothing like that is happening now. Nobody gets away with anything. ‘He loves to see players in the gym getting stronger and it stands to reason. If you’re fitter and stronger you will be able to do more on a Saturday afternoon. It is brutal but I love it.’ Pulis is desperate for reinforcements but Foster believes players already at the Hawthorns are improving under the new manager.

If not, you haven’t got much of a chance with him. ‘He has set up a brilliant fines system which has already recouped a good bit of money and people won’t be slipping up anymore. It’s good. I can’t go into details!’

chatgpt: West Bromwich Albion goalkeeper Ben Foster has praised the impact of manager Tony Pulis on the team's fitness and work ethic, following their 2-1 victory over Birmingham City in the FA Cup fifth round on Saturday. Foster, who has worked extensively with Pulis at both West Brom and Stoke City, believes that the manager's focus on fitness has been instrumental in their recent success. Speaking after the victory at St. Andrew's, Foster said: "Tony's a big believer in being fit and doing all the right things, and it's definitely paying off for us now." West Brom's victory over their local rivals was the latest in a string of impressive performances under Pulis, who took charge of the club in January. The Baggies have won three of their last five games, and are currently sitting in 13th place in the Premier League. Despite their recent success, however, Foster insists that there is still much work to be done. "We're not the finished article by any stretch of the imagination," he said. "But we're getting there, and we're really happy with the progress we're making under Tony." Pulis, for his part, was delighted with the result at Birmingham, describing the performance as "excellent". Goals from Darren Fletcher and Chris Brunt secured the victory for West Brom, despite a late scare when Birmingham pulled one back in stoppage time. Speaking after the match, Pulis praised his players' attitude and work ethic. "We've got a fantastic group of lads here," he said. "They're working hard every day in training, and that's starting to show on the pitch." Foster, who has been a key player for West Brom this season, echoed his manager's sentiments, saying: "I love working with Tony. He demands a lot from us, but it's always for the right reasons. He's a great manager and a great person to have around the place." West Brom's focus now turns to their next Premier League fixture, a home game against Crystal Palace on Saturday. With both teams fighting to avoid relegation, it promises to be a closely-fought encounter. For Foster and his teammates, however, the focus remains on continuing their positive run of form under Pulis. "We're taking things one game at a time," he said. "But we're confident that we can keep improving, and hopefully achieve something special this season."
