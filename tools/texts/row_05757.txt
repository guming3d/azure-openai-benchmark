chatgpt: Gwyneth Paltrow, the Hollywood actress and author, recently made a revealing comment about her musical tastes in the kitchen. The 40-year-old said that she often raps along to songs while she cooks, but her husband Chris Martin is yet to discover an appreciation for her unique style. Paltrow, who is currently promoting her new cookbook titled "The Clean Plate: Eat, Reset, Heal," made the comment in a recent interview. The actress explained that she enjoys listening to rap music while she cooks and finds it inspiring. She said that it provides her with a sense of energy and creativity, which she believes translates into her culinary creations. However, Paltrow confessed that her husband, lead singer of the popular band Coldplay, has not quite warmed up to her musical preferences in the kitchen. Martin is known for his musical talents and is often associated with rock and pop music. Despite this, Paltrow joked that she is still trying to convert him to her rap-loving ways. "I like to listen to a lot of hip hop â€“ like Cardi B," she said in the interview. "But my husband isn't particularly fond of it. He's more of a Coldplay guy." Paltrow's new cookbook has been receiving positive reviews since its release earlier this month. It focuses on healthy and clean eating, with recipes that are designed to help readers reset their diets and improve their overall health. The actress has become well-known for promoting a healthy lifestyle and has even launched her own wellness brand, Goop. As she continues to promote her cookbook, Paltrow is sure to bring her unique musical tastes into the kitchen. Whether Martin will eventually come around to her rap-loving ways remains to be seen, but it seems that Paltrow is content enjoying her tunes and whipping up healthy meals for her family.
