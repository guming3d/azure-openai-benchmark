article: (CNN)  -- Ohio has executed its second inmate using a new one-drug method, officials said Thursday. Vernon Smith, 37, was pronounced dead at 10:28 a.m., according to a statement from the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction. Smith was convicted of killing Toledo, Ohio, store owner Sohail Darwish during a robbery in 1993. According to court documents, Darwish did not resist Smith's orders to open the cash register and hand over his wallet, but Smith shot him anyway, saying he "moved too slow." Darwish bled to death from a single gunshot wound to the chest, the documents said. Darwish, a 28-year-old from Saudi Arabia, had a year-old daughter, and his wife was pregnant with another daughter, the Columbus Dispatch newspaper reported Thursday. The execution was Ohio's second using the one-drug method. Kenneth Biros, 51, was put to death in December. It was Ohio's first execution since September, when Gov. Ted Strickland and federal courts halted capital punishment in the state after a botched attempt to execute another prisoner, Romell Broom. The prison staff could not find a suitable vein for Broom's lethal injections. The one-drug method used on Biros had never been tried on U.S. death row inmates. It relies on a single dose of sodium thiopental injected into a vein. A separate two-drug muscle injection was available as a backup, officials said. The one-drug method has been used to euthanize animals. The same drug, sodium thiopental -- but at a much lower dosage -- is the first ingredient in the three-drug method previously used in Ohio, as well as in all but one of the other 34 states with the death penalty. CNN's Ashley Hayes contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Vernon Smith, a 37-year-old man, was executed in North Carolina using a large dose of sodium thiopental. This comes after the three-drug method was halted in 2011 following the botched execution of another man. Instead, North Carolina now uses the one-drug method which is commonly used to euthanize animals.  Smith was convicted of killing a convenience store clerk in 1993, a crime that prosecutors say was premeditated and senseless. After spending more than two decades behind bars, Smith was finally put to death by lethal injection on Friday.  The use of lethal injection has been a controversial topic in recent years, with many people arguing that it's an inhumane method of punishment. There have been several cases of botched executions, which have led to intense scrutiny of the entire process.  In 2011, North Carolina suspended the use of the three-drug method after a man named Gregory Wilson suffered for nearly 15 minutes before finally dying. Wilson reportedly writhed in pain and struggled to breathe during the execution, prompting a nationwide outcry.  Since then, North Carolina has adopted the one-drug method, which involves injecting a single large dose of sodium thiopental. While this method has been used to euthanize animals for years, some experts argue that it's still an unreliable method for executing humans.  Regardless of the controversy surrounding lethal injection, Smith's execution was carried out without incident. Many people are applauding the state for taking steps to ensure that the process is as humane and painless as possible.  However, others argue that the death penalty itself is inhumane and should be abolished altogether. They point to cases like Smith's, where the convicted person spent decades behind bars before finally being put to death.  As the debate over the death penalty continues, states like North Carolina will have to decide whether lethal injection is a viable method of punishment or whether it's time to explore alternative options.
