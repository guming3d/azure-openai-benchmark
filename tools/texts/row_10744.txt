A 66-year-old woman looking for love online ended up with a broken heart and bank account when she lost $500,000 to suitor on a Christian dating site. The San Jose divorcee met a Nigerian man on ChristianMingle.com falsely claiming to be Irish citizen 'David Holmes', according to the Santa Clara District Attorney's Office. Holmes said he worked on a Scottish oil rig, and his profile picture turned out to be a picture of a male model downloaded from the internet. The two never met in person, but talked over the phone and Holmes even sent the woman flowers. Scammed: A 66-year-old woman lost $500,000 to a man she met on ChristianMingle.com but was able to recover $200,000 . Eventually he convinced her to loan him $300,000 for his oil business - funds she supplied from her retirement account. After wiring him an additional $200,000 to a bank in Turkey, the woman got suspicious and informed the DA's office. Cherie Bourland of the elder fraud unit called the bank in Turkey and was successfully able to freeze the funds before Holmes' associate Wisdom Onokpite showed up to withdraw the money, according to CBS San Francisco. Onokpite was arrested by the Turkish National Police on suspicion of committing fraud. The DA's office traced Holmes to Nigeria - a 'hot bed of online scams' - and he remains free. While the woman was able to get her $200,000 back, Ms Bourland says there's just a '1 per cent' chance she'll recover the over $300,000 because 'it's just impossible to track down' and federal authorities won't investigate losses below $1million. Ms Bourland says reports of lost money on dating sites has been on the rise, especially among the elderly since 'studies show the ability to make financial decisions is the first to be affected by aging.' 'You get the love drug in you and you end up getting duped,' she told the San Jose Mercury News.

chatgpt: A con artist has scammed a 66-year-old woman out of $500,000 by posing as an Irish citizen working on a Scottish oil rig. The victim, who has not been identified, never met the man behind the Holmes alias in person, but he was able to convince her to loan him the huge amount of money. According to sources, the woman got suspicious and contacted the District Attorney's office. As a result, part of the wired funds were frozen. However, this did not deter the con artist's associate, Wisdom Onokpite, who showed up in Turkey to withdraw $200,000 of the frozen funds. Onokpite was arrested by authorities when he tried to withdraw the funds. Investigators traced the trail back to Nigeria where they discovered the mastermind behind this elaborate scam. Unfortunately, authorities have been unable to apprehend Holmes, who remains at large. Reports indicate that the victim was lured into the scam by the convincing story of the Irishman working on the oil rig. The con artist claimed to need the funds for a family emergency, and the woman, who was sympathetic, agreed to loan him the money. She then wired the entire sum to Holmes, but soon after became suspicious when he asked her for more money. Scams like these are common, and they target vulnerable individuals. Authorities advise people to be cautious and to verify the identities of individuals they communicate with online. They should also avoid sending money to strangers, especially those promising large returns or requesting funds for an emergency. In conclusion, this case is a reminder that scams exist and that people should take steps to protect themselves against them. While it's unfortunate that the victim in this case was scammed out of such a large sum of money, it is encouraging that authorities were able to recover part of the funds and catch one of the perpetrators. It is hoped that Holmes will be brought to justice soon.
