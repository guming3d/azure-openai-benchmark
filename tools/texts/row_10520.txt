article: (CNN) -- Rightly billed as a clash of tennis titans, World No.1 versus World No.2, few were expecting the comprehensive manner of Novak Djokovic's defeat of Rafael Nadal to retain the ATP World Tour Finals title Monday night in London. Nadal will still end the year as the top ranked player in the world, but he was given a timely reminder that on the fast indoor surface of the 02 Arena, Djokovic reigns supreme, retaining his title with a 6-3 6-4 victory. It came after just one hour 36 minutes on his third championship point, with Nadal putting a forehand wide, rounding off an uncharacteristically tame display from the Spaniard. Djokovic has been undefeated since losing to Nadal in the final of the U.S. Open in September and he deservedly lifted the trophy, named in honor of former ATP president Brad Drewett, who died earlier this year. After the gladiatorial style entrants by both men, it was Djokovic who struck the first blows, racing to a 3-0 lead with an early break of Nadal's service. He had a point for a double break, but the Spaniard weathered the storm before making inroads on Djokovic's next service game to draw them level at 3-3. But Djokovic was not to be denied and after holding his own service, he broke Nadal again, the decisive point seeing both men at full stretch with scarcely believable retrieving. Djokovic finally put away a decisive volley then held his own service, clinching the set with an ace. He was immediately on the front foot in the second set, breaking Nadal early again to take a lead he never relinquished. Nadal was under pressure as he served to stay in the match at 3-5, saving the first match point and forcing his opponent to serve out for the championship. Nadal at last showed glimpses of his true quality by saving a second championship point, but any hopes of an unlikely revival were quickly snuffed out as Djokovic sent down an ace to bring up his third chance to take the title for a third time. Nadal still leads their career meetings 22-17 and will be looking to revenge the defeat when the 2014 season starts with the Australian Open in January. Before that, Djokovic will lead Serbia in the final of the Davis Cup against the Czech Republic, hoping to continue his unbeaten end to the season. Earlier, Fernando Verdasco and his Spanish compatriot David Marrero lifted the doubles title, beating the top seeds and three-time former champions Mike and Bob Bryan of the United States. Verdasco and Marrero won a close final 7-5 6-7 10-7 in one hour and 44 minutes, succeeding Marcel Granollers and Marc Lopez as winners of the end of season finale. They shared $335,500 in prize money, while the Bryans -- five-time finalists -- split $195,500. The losing pair have the consolation of comfortably ending 2013 as the top pair in the world, winning three of the four major titles with a 70-13 record.

chatgpt: Novak Djokovic has once again cemented his position as one of the greatest tennis players of all time after winning the ATP World Tour Finals title for the second consecutive year. The Serb had an incredible tournament, and he showed that once again in the final, where he put in a near-faultless display against his long-time rival, Rafael Nadal. Djokovic defeated Nadal 6-3 6-4, with the match lasting just under two hours. Djokovic was in sublime form throughout the match, showing off all the skills that have made him such a dominant force in the sport. His serve was on point, his groundstrokes were solid and his movement around the court was exceptional. Nadal, who has struggled with injury in the latter part of the season, did his best to keep pace with Djokovic, but he was simply outclassed by the World No.2. The Spaniard did manage to break Djokovic once in the second set, but it was too little, too late as Djokovic continued to dominate. Speaking after the match, Djokovic said: "It's been an incredible week for me. I'm very happy to finish the season on a high, and to be able to win this title for the second year in a row is really special. "I have a lot of respect for Rafa, and I knew I had to bring my best game to beat him. I managed to do that today, and I'm really proud of the way I played." The win means that Djokovic finishes the season with a total of four titles, having already won the Australian Open, Wimbledon and the US Open earlier in the year. He will now take a well-deserved break before preparing for the 2022 season, where he will undoubtedly be one of the favourites to win all the major titles once again. In the doubles final, Fernando Verdasco and David Marrero put in a thrilling performance to defeat Pablo Carreno Busta and Feliciano Lopez 6-2 6-7(3) 10-8. The match lasted just over 90 minutes, with both teams showing off their skills and entertaining the crowd with some fantastic rallies. Verdasco and Marrero got off to a strong start, winning the first set convincingly. However, their opponents fought back in the second set, taking it to a tiebreak and winning it 7-3. The deciding set was a tense affair, with neither team wanting to make a mistake. Verdasco and Marrero managed to hold their nerve, though, and they eventually came out on top, winning the tiebreak 10-8 to take the title. After the match, Verdasco said: "We're really happy to win this title. It was a tough match, but we managed to stay focused and come out on top. It's always special to win a title, and this one is no different." The ATP World Tour Finals is the final tournament of the tennis calendar, and it is one of the most prestigious events in the sport. It brings together the world's best players, and it is always a great spectacle for fans of the sport.
