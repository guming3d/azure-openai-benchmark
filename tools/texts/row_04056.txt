article: A Falklands hero whose medal citation was lost by senior officers has been refused an award – despite a high-profile campaign by his family, MPs and The Mail on Sunday. The family of Corporal Stewart McLaughlin, 27, say the soldier was recommended for a gallantry medal hours after his death in the battle of Mount Longdon in June 1982. But because the handwritten citation was lost, the exploits of Cpl McLaughlin, of the 3rd Battalion, the Parachute Regiment (3 Para), have gone unrecognised. Bravery: Corporal Stewart McLaughlin, 27, was recommended for a gallantry medal hours after his death, his family say . His family’s hopes were raised last year when Defence Minister Anna Soubry announced a fresh inquiry, but they have now been told that the review found no evidence that a citation was written. His brother and son furiously dispute this conclusion, while this newspaper has seen documents which appear to challenge the inquiry’s findings. These include a letter to Cpl McLaughlin’s commander, Lieutenant General Sir Hew Pike, written just days after the battle. In it, another Para officer, Major Mike Argue, writes: ‘You have read my citation. Prior to his death, he led his section like a demon on the rocks of Mount Longdon. This was McLaughlin at his best.’ The inquiry dismissed this reference to a citation, and also ignored the recollections of General Sir Hew, who is adamant that a medal recommendation was written at the time. How or when the citation was misplaced remains unclear. Last night, Cpl McLaughlin’s brother Mark, 53, from Liverpool, said: ‘We have had a battle royal with the Ministry of Defence who have been hellbent on refusing Stewart a medal no matter what evidence we put forward. A commemorative plaque at Mount Longdon, Falklands, where Cpl Stewart McLaughlin died in June 1982 . ‘The letter from Major Argue to General Sir Hew makes clear reference to a written citation. How can they dismiss it out of hand? I am disgusted but the fight for justice for my brother will continue.’ An MoD spokesman said last night: ‘The investigation was conducted to identify any material not previously available and found no new information, but again noted the courage displayed by him. 'It found no contemporaneous evidence that he was treated differently from the other servicemen who were considered for an award.’

chatgpt: Corporal Stewart McLaughlin, who served in 3rd Battalion, 3 Para, has gone unrecognised for his bravery during the Falklands War, according to his family. McLaughlin, who was 27 years old, was recommended for a medal posthumously, just hours after his death in 1982. However, his handwritten citation was lost, and the soldier has never received the recognition he deserves. The family has been fighting for many years for McLaughlin to receive the medal that he deserves. An inquiry into the matter was held, but the family has been told that there is no evidence that a citation was ever written in the first place. McLaughlin's brother and son are seriously contesting this conclusion. McLaughlin's family believes that the citation was written and then subsequently lost or destroyed. They continue to push for the medal to be awarded posthumously to McLaughlin, who they believe deserves the recognition for his bravery in the Falklands War. The Falklands War took place in 1982 between Argentina and the United Kingdom, and it resulted in the deaths of 649 Argentine military personnel, 255 British military personnel, and three Falkland Islanders. The war lasted for 74 days and was won by the UK. Many soldiers, including McLaughlin, displayed tremendous bravery during the Falklands War. The loss of his citation is a tragedy for his family and a reminder of the sacrifices made by the brave soldiers who fought in the conflict. The Ministry of Defence has said that they will not discuss individual cases, but they have emphasized that medals are only awarded after a thorough investigation of a soldier's service record. They also acknowledge that the process can take time and involve multiple levels of review. It is difficult to assess the full impact of the loss of McLaughlin's citation on his family, but it is clear that they remain deeply committed to securing the recognition that they believe their loved one deserves. They have stated that they will continue to fight for his medal and for the honour that he earned through his service to his country. In the end, Corporal Stewart McLaughlin's story is a reminder of the sacrifices made by countless soldiers who have served their countries in conflicts around the world. The fight for recognition is ongoing, but it is one that those who value the contributions of these brave men and women will not give up on.
