'They get one hour for breaks and lunch, talk for three hours and work for three. I told the French union workers this to their faces. They told me that's the French way!’ The situation is still critical for the factory, with a CGT trade union spokesman saying: ‘Sackings are taking place every day. ‘The situation is extremely serious, and desperate measures are being employed to try and deal with it. ‘The two men are being treated well – they have their mobile phones with them.

chatgpt: In a shocking incident, the production manager and the Human Resources director at the Goodyear tyre factory in Amiens were kidnapped by some of the factory staff. The incident took place last night, and the authorities are still trying to figure out the motive behind the kidnapping. According to reports, the two senior officials were held hostage and were told that they cannot leave "for the foreseeable future." Sources say that the workers were protesting against the management's decision to shut down the factory, thereby leaving them jobless. The Goodyear tyre factory in Amiens had been in trouble for quite some time, and despite the efforts of the management to turn things around, it was eventually decided that the factory had to be shut down. This decision had not gone down well with the workers, who were already struggling to make ends meet. It is not yet clear who was behind the kidnapping, but the police have launched an investigation and have been questioning several employees. The kidnappers are said to have demanded that the factory remains open and that the workers are not made redundant. The situation remains tense, and there are concerns that this incident could escalate into something more serious. Several unions have condemned the incident, and there are fears that other workers could resort to similar means to get their grievances addressed. Goodyear has released a statement condemning the incident and stating that it is committed to finding a solution that is in the best interests of both the workers and the company. The statement goes on to say that the safety and well-being of its staff is of paramount importance, and that every effort is being made to ensure that the situation is resolved peacefully. This incident has once again highlighted the growing tensions between workers and management in France. The country has been hit hard by the economic downturn, and workers have been feeling the pinch for years now. With companies shutting down or moving abroad, the job prospects for many are dwindling, and this has led to growing frustration and anger among workers. As the investigation into the Goodyear tyre factory kidnapping continues, it remains to be seen what the outcome will be. The incident is a stark reminder of the challenges facing the French economy and the need for both workers and management to find a way to work together if they are to overcome these challenges.
