The pressure of the World Cup coming to its final stretch doesn't seem to be getting to the Argentinian players as they took part in a spot of tennis football during training. Their World Cup semi-final showdown with Holland will go a long way to determining whether Lionel Messi is to gain hero status like Diego Maradona.

The team, led by coach Alejandro Sabella, took to the field for an intense session of the sport which combines elements of football and tennis, aiming to improve their skills and coordination ahead of the crucial game. The players appeared relaxed and focused during the training session, which came as a break from their more traditional training methods. Argentina are looking for their third World Cup title and their first in 28 years. The team reached the semi-final after defeating Belgium 1-0 in the quarter-finals, thanks to a goal from Gonzalo Higuain. However, they face a tough challenge against a confident Holland side, who have been impressive throughout the tournament. One of the main focal points of the Argentina team is Lionel Messi, who is currently leading the race for the Golden Boot award for the top goal scorer in the tournament. The Barcelona forward has scored four goals so far, and will be eager to add to his tally against Holland. However, he will face a tough challenge from the Dutch defense. Argentina will also be without Angel di Maria, who suffered a thigh injury during the quarter-final game against Belgium. His absence will be a blow to the team, as he has been instrumental in their progress so far. Holland, on the other hand, will be buoyed by their impressive victory over Costa Rica in the quarter-finals. The team, led by Manchester United-bound Louis van Gaal, have been playing a high-tempo game throughout the tournament, and will be looking to continue their winning streak in the semi-finals. Both teams are expected to line up with strong starting elevens, with Argentina likely to field Sergio Aguero alongside Messi in attack. For Holland, they will rely on the attacking talents of Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben. The match is expected to be an intense and closely-fought encounter, with both teams having the potential to win. With a place in the final at stake, the players will be giving it their all on the pitch. One thing is for sure, football fans around the world will be eagerly anticipating this clash between two of the tournamentâ€™s strongest sides.
