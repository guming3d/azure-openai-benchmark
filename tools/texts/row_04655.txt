The England football team will not use British Airways to travel to next year's World Cup in Brazil after talks broke down between the airline and the Football Association.

However, the national flagship carrier insists that it simply cannot spare a plane for the team during the peak summer season.

Negotiations: BA is said to have spent a year in talks with the FA over the possibility of a deal . The FA and BA, which has flown the England team to previous World Cups, were in talks for a year about the possibility of working together, according to The Sun. But an airline source told the paper that it was too expensive to take the team - set to include stars such as Steven Gerrard, Wayne Rooney and Theo Walcott - to Brazil. 'It would cost up to £10million to take a plane out of service, dedicate it to England, tear up the timetable and dedicate crews for the duration of the tournament,' the source said. 'In return BA gets no more than a photo of the back of a plane in a few newspapers. In brutal terms it just doesn't make sense.' Stars: But the likes of Theo Walcott, left, and Wayne Rooney, right, will not be flying BA next summer . British Airways flew the England team to the 2006 World Cup in Germany, but for the latest tournament, held in South Africa, players used Virgin Atlantic. The airline said in a statement that it did not have the capacity to take Roy Hodgson's team to Brazil next year. 'We have not refused to carry the England team,' a spokesman said. 'Regrettably, we could not reach agreement with the FA because we will not have a spare aircraft available for the length of time the FA wanted during the busy summer period next year.

We wish the team the best of luck and look forward to flying thousands of fans to the World Cup.' The team will be based in Rio de Janeiro, but will have to take internal flights within the country to reach the distant venues where their games are being held. England's first match is against Italy in Manaus on June 14, with the team's other two group games taking place in Sao Paulo and Belo Horizonte.

chatgpt: The Football Association (FA) is facing a potential crisis ahead of next year's tournament, as it struggles to find a way to transport the England team to matches. Reports suggest that negotiations with British Airways (BA) have broken down over the cost of the flights. According to insiders, the FA had been in discussions with BA for nearly a year, trying to agree on the logistics of getting the team from its base in the UK to the host country. However, talks have now collapsed, with BA allegedly backing out due to the high expense involved. Sources say that the airline had initially been keen to work with the FA on this project, but that the costs of transporting a large group of people, plus their associated equipment and staff, became prohibitive. The timing of the tournament is also thought to be a factor, with BA already stretched during the busy summer travel season. The FA is now said to be considering alternative options, such as chartering a private jet or working with another airline. However, these alternatives are also likely to be expensive, and could present their own logistical challenges. The situation has raised concerns among fans and commentators, who fear that the England team's preparations for the tournament could be affected. Travel is a key part of the lead-up to any major sporting event, and any disruption to this process could have a knock-on effect on training, tactics, and morale. The FA has declined to comment on the situation, citing the ongoing nature of the negotiations. However, insiders indicate that the organisation is working hard to find a solution that will enable the team to travel to the tournament in comfort and safety. In the meantime, supporters are left wondering about the potential impact of these issues on England's chances of success. The team is already under pressure, having failed to deliver a major trophy since the 1966 World Cup. The tournament next year represents a major opportunity to break that drought, but only if preparations go smoothly. All eyes will now be on the FA as it tries to salvage the situation, and ensure that the England team is able to compete at the highest level. The clock is ticking, with less than a year to go before the tournament kicks off. The pressure is on for the FA to find a solution, and ensure that England's hopes are not grounded before they have even taken off.
