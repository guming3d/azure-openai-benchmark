article: It is a timelapse video that is simply out of this world. Nasa astronaut Reid Wiseman shared this incredible footage on Vine this week, showing the cargo spacecraft Cygnus being released from the International Space Station (ISS). The clip shows the Cygnus being released by the ISS robotic arm and beginning to orbit on its own, disappearing into space as the Earth rotates below - all captured at super speed. 'I pushed the "so long" button': Astronaut Reid Wiseman has shared another incredible capture from space, a time-lapse video of the cargo spacecraft Cygnus being released from the International Space Station . Flight Engineer Wiseman, who was assisting fellow astronaut Alexander Gerst in the release, captioned the video: 'SpaceVine timelapse - @astro_alex worked the arm and I pushed the “so long” button on #Cygnus'. In July Cygnus carried supplies to the astronauts including food, spacewalking gear, life support equipment, photography and video gear, Nasa revealed on their website. A second video posted by the astronaut shortly afterwards shows the spacecraft's re-entry over the Pacific Ocean. Wiseman has gained a huge following on social media thanks to his jaw-dropping images and videos from space, with over 250,000 followers on Twitter and over 23,000 on video-sharing platform Vine. Going: Cygnus carried supplies to the astronauts including food, spacewalking gear, life support equipment, photography and video gear . Gone: The Cygnus disappears into space, but its fiery re-entry was also captured on video by the astronauts . The 38-year-old's most memorable captures include a video of lightning storms over Italy, Typhoon Halong covering the Earth, and incredible pictures of the aurora. He also had many baffled in August when he shared a picture of mysterious green lights off the coast of Thailand, with followers down on Earth throwing around theories including bioluminescent algae and nuclear waste. The lights were later revealed to be fishing boats. Wiseman has been on the ISS since May, and In June became the first ISS crew member to send a Vine from space. Incredible: Wiseman last month shared jaw-dropping images of the aurora . Sharing images from ISS over social media has been popular with Nasa astronauts for some time however. Commander Chris Hadfield's posts on Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr also gained a huge following for his unique perspective over Earth.

chatgpt: NASA astronaut Reid Wiseman has shared stunning footage of the Cygnus spacecraft being released into orbit by the International Space Station's robotic arm. The clip, posted on social media, has amazed space enthusiasts around the world. The Cygnus spacecraft, which was launched from Earth two months ago, was used to deliver vital supplies to the ISS. With its mission complete, the spacecraft was released into orbit above the Earth. The footage captured by Wiseman shows this release in real time, offering a breathtaking view of Earth from above. In the second video shared by Wiseman, the Cygnus spacecraft is shown re-entering Earth's atmosphere. The footage captures the spacecraft's fiery descent over the Pacific Ocean, as it makes its way back to Earth. For space enthusiasts, the Cygnus spacecraft represents the latest achievement in NASA's ongoing mission to further our understanding of space. The spacecraft's successful delivery of supplies to the ISS is just one of many milestones in NASA's current agenda. The release of the Cygnus spacecraft is a reminder of the incredible technology and capabilities of NASA and its team of astronauts and engineers. It also showcases the importance of international cooperation in the exploration of space. NASA's future plans include returning American astronauts to the moon by 2024, and eventually establishing a permanent presence on the moon. These ambitious goals demonstrate NASA's commitment to continued exploration and scientific discovery. The release of the Cygnus spacecraft is also a reminder of the important role that social media plays in connecting the public to NASA's efforts. Sharing footage and updates on social media allows people from all around the globe to be inspired by and learn about NASA's ongoing work. As NASA and the international community continue to explore space and push the limits of our capabilities, it is exciting to think about what technology and breakthroughs the future may hold. With astronauts like Reid Wiseman at the helm, we can be sure that NASA will continue to inspire and amaze us with their achievements.
