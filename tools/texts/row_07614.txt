article: MUMBAI, India (CNN) -- The lawyer for the main suspect in last year's deadly terrorist attack in Mumbai was removed Wednesday, delaying the high-profile trial that was set to begin. Soldiers patrol in Mumbai on the eve of the trial of a key suspect in last year's attacks in the Indian city. The trial start for Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, 21, is expected to be moved to Thursday as officials scramble to settle the lawyer issue. Kasab is thought to be the only one of 10 gunmen to survive the three-day siege, which killed more than 160 people in November. As the trial was to begin, the judge removed attorney Anjali Waghmare because she also was representing a witness in the case. Waghmare argued that she had no idea that the person was a witness in the terror case, and she was representing this person in a different case. But the judge declared that it was a conflict of interest. An Indian court appointed Waghmare two weeks ago to represent Kasab, and it was unclear who would replace her. Kasab demanded that his attorney be replaced with a Pakistani lawyer. But the judge denied that request and said that a Pakistani lawyer may be able to be brought in as a consultant from outside the courtroom. Kasab, a Pakistani national, faces more than a dozen charges, including murder, conspiracy to wage a war against the nation and terrorism. During the proceedings Wednesday Kasab seemed relaxed and smiled many time at the large crowd of journalists in the courtroom. Kasab also requested newspapers to be brought in so that he could see what the media was writing about him. Prosecutors last month accused him of trying to delay the trial by insisting that the 11,000-page document detailing the charges against him -- which was written in English and the local Marathi language -- be translated into Urdu, the official language of Pakistan. The court rejected his request. Wednesday's trial was to take place in a makeshift court set up in a jail where Kasab -- who has been communicating with the judge via videolink -- is being held. Indian authorities have long blamed the Mumbai attacks on Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, a Pakistan-based militant outfit, but the group has denied responsibility. The violence initially heightened tensions between the two nuclear states. India has urged Pakistan to destroy what it calls terrorist infrastructure in that country. The two nations are longtime rivals that have fought three wars since their independence from the British, and conducted countering nuclear weapons tests in 1998.

chatgpt: The trial of Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, the sole surviving gunman of the November 2008 terror attack in Mumbai, has been delayed due to a legal complication. According to reports, the lawyer representing the main suspect has been removed from the case as she was also representing a witness in the case. Kasab’s trial was scheduled to start on Wednesday, but it is now unclear when the court proceedings will resume. The removal of the lawyer, Anjali Waghmare, has caused a significant delay in the trial, which has been dragging on for over a year. The November 2008 siege targeted prominent locations in Mumbai, including hotels, hospitals, and railway stations. Over 160 people lost their lives in the attack, and over 300 were injured. Kasab was arrested during the siege, and he is the only surviving gunman. The legal complication arises from the fact that Waghmare was representing one of the witnesses in the case, which could cause a potential conflict of interest. The court had previously ordered her to drop the witness, but she failed to comply, leading to her removal from the case. The prosecution argued that Waghmare’s representation of both Kasab and the witness could have affected the outcome of the case. They argued that it could have resulted in a breach of attorney-client privilege, and may have affected the credibility of the testimony. This is not the first time that Kasab’s trial has been hit by delays and complications. The trial has been ongoing for over a year, and has been marred by a number of disputes between the prosecution and defense teams. Despite the delays and complications, the prosecution remains determined to secure a conviction against Kasab. They argue that he was a key figure in the November 2008 attacks, and that he played a central role in planning and executing the siege. Kasab has always maintained his innocence, and he has argued that he was coerced into participating in the attack. He has been charged with multiple counts of murder, as well as other serious offenses, and if convicted, he could face the death penalty. The removal of Waghmare from the case has caused a significant setback for Kasab, and it remains to be seen when the trial will resume. The delays and complications have meant that justice for the victims of the November 2008 attacks has been slow in coming, and it may be some time before a verdict is reached.
