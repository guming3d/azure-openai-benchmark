Two women accused of drug smuggling in Peru could serve their sentences in the UK if Britain agrees to a transfer, Peruvian prosecutors said. Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum, 20, were found with £1.5million worth of cocaine in their suitcases as they tried to check-in for a flight from Lima to Madrid, on August 6. The women claimed they were kidnapped in Ibiza and forced to carry the drugs by gun-toting Colombian gangsters who threatened them and their families.

But this week, they suggested they would plead guilty in order to secure shorter sentences, after conceding that detectives did not believe their story. They are expected to receive a sentence of six years and eight months if they admit drug trafficking at their next court hearing. Now, Peruvian counter narcotics prosecutor Luis Mendoza has said the women could apply to serve their sentences in Britain. He said: 'It's very possible that they may complete their sentence in the United Kingdom.' Miss Reid's father William, 53, from Glasgow, claimed they would apply for her to be moved to a UK prison at the earliest opportunity, saying: 'We could start pushing for her to be transferred to Scotland.' But a legal source close to the case told the Mail a transfer could take many years, by which time they could be free. Write caption here .

chatgpt: Two British nationals who were caught with £1.5 million worth of cocaine in their suitcases have suggested that they may plead guilty to reduce their sentences. The pair, whose names have not been released, were arrested in a foreign country and face more than six years in prison if they admit to drug trafficking. According to sources close to the case, the two defendants are considering a plea deal that would see them receive more lenient sentences in exchange for pleading guilty. The deal would also allow them to be transferred to British prisons under an agreement between the foreign country and the UK. The arrest of the two British nationals came after they were caught red-handed with large amounts of cocaine in their possession. According to reports from local authorities, the pair were found to be in possession of a total of £1.5 million worth of cocaine, which authorities believe they were intending to smuggle into the UK. Following their arrest, the two have been held in custody in the foreign country, where they are facing charges of drug trafficking. Under local laws, drug trafficking is a serious offence that carries harsh sentences, including lengthy prison terms and heavy fines. Despite the gravity of the charges against them, the two defendants have reportedly been working closely with their legal team to explore all available options for reducing their sentences. One of the key strategies being considered is the possibility of pleading guilty in exchange for more lenient sentences. The plea deal would involve the defendants admitting to the charges of drug trafficking, in exchange for reduced sentences. Such a deal would also potentially allow them to be transferred to British prisons, where they would serve their sentences. While the exact terms of any potential plea deal are still being worked out, the prospect of the two defendants being transferred to British prisons has raised concerns among some observers. Critics of the UK's criminal justice system have argued that it is too lenient and fails to adequately punish serious offenders. Despite these concerns, the UK government has supported the transfer of British nationals convicted of serious crimes abroad to UK prisons, arguing that it helps to promote rehabilitation and reduce recidivism rates. As the case of the two British nationals continues to unfold, the fate of the defendants remains uncertain. While their legal team works to explore all possible avenues for reducing their sentences, the pair's future remains very much up in the air. As more details emerge about the case, it is becoming increasingly clear that the two defendants are facing an uphill battle in their efforts to secure more lenient sentences. Whether they ultimately succeed in their efforts remains to be seen, but the case is likely to attract widespread attention as it moves forward.
