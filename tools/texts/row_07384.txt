article: Mantecore, the white tiger whose co-starring role in Siegfried and Roy's illusion-packed Las Vegas act was overshadowed by one visceral act of violence, has died. The big cat was 17. Mantecore died March 19, wrote Siegfried Fischbacher on the duo's Facebook page Tuesday. The tiger had been living at the Siegfried & Roy Secret Garden and Dolphin Habitat at the Mirage hotel. Mantecore was a part of the long-running "Siegfried & Roy" show when it lunged at Roy Horn's neck halfway through a sold-out performance in October 2003. "He (Horn) looked like a rag doll in his mouth," an audience member told CNN at the time. Trainers quickly rushed the stage to subdue the tiger. It  was Horn's 59th birthday. By the time emergency officials arrived, Horn had suffered massive blood loss and was in critical condition. He also suffered a stroke and required two surgeries. Four days after the attack, Fischbacher defended the tiger on CNN's "Larry King Live." "Listen, I say it was an accident," he said, adding that if Mantecore wanted to kill his partner "it would (have happened) in no time." Siegfried also said that Mantecore biting Horn's neck was similar to what a mother cat does with her cubs. Horn did survive the attack, but was left partially paralyzed. He never returned to the stage and makes only rare public appearances. The show, too, was canceled. In his post about Mantecore, Fischbacher wrote about the closeness he felt with the tiger. Mantecore was one of three cubs. The cub's mother neglected it. So Fischbacher once had to go into the tiger's den and give it mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. The young cub was then cared for by Fischbacher's mother, who bottle-fed it every three hours. "Farewell my dear friend," Fischbacher wrote. "Know that your image is forever burned into my heart."

chatgpt: It has been more than 17 years since Mantecore, the white tiger, attacked Roy Horn in a sold-out performance during the Siegfried & Roy show in Las Vegas back in 2003. However, the incident remains one of the most shocking and tragic moments in the history of live entertainment. Roy was left paralyzed and in critical condition following the attack. The show was immediately canceled, and the future of the popular production was uncertain. Fortunately, Roy recovered and continued to receive support from his fans and colleagues. Despite the tragedy, Roy's longtime partner and friend, Siegfried Fischbacher, recently took to Facebook to share a heartwarming tribute to Mantecore, who passed away in 2014. In his post, Siegfried shared photos and memories of the beloved tiger and praised his impressive abilities. "Mantecore was not only a magnificent white tiger but also a great companion and friend," Siegfried wrote. "He was a true professional and a joy to work with. Rest in peace, Mantecore." The post received thousands of likes and comments, with fans and fellow performers expressing their admiration for the iconic duo and their legacy. Many also expressed their sympathy for Roy and his ongoing struggles following the attack. Despite the tragedy, the Siegfried & Roy show continued to captivate audiences for many years after the incident, showcasing the incredible talents of its performers and the enduring bond between Siegfried and Roy.
