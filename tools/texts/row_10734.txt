'We were trying to think of a catchy names for it but is is basically a Christmas-tree shaped chip butty. 'It's common place to do battered Christmas mince pies and puddings now and so we thought we would put that on its head but still do something in keeping with festivities. 'When making it we had to act quick - we were really busy shovelling the chips into the butties, it took an hour to build. We would have gone higher but it would have gone through the ceiling.
