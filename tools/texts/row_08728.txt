article: (CNN) -- Authorities in Azerbaijan recently uncovered a radical Islamic terror plot against the U.S. Embassy in the capital, Baku, prompting the facility to close its doors to the public Monday, Azerbaijan and U.S. officials told CNN. The Bibi Heybat Mosque, just outside the capital Baku. As a precaution, Britain also shut its embassy in Baku to the public on Monday "following security concerns nearby," Britain's Foreign Office said. The terror plot was unraveled after a weekend raid outside Baku that netted several suspected members of the radical group, two U.S. officials who asked not to be identified and a spokesman for Azerbaijan's National Security Ministry told CNN. U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack stressed that the details "are still unfolding," and the threat "may or may not be" linked to the Saturday raid. "There were some specific and credible threat information concerning the embassy and plans by militants to in some way do harm to individuals in and around the U.S. Embassy there," McCormack said, noting that no specific individuals were targeted. Several days ago, an Azerbaijani army officer who had connections to a radical Islamic group seized four assault rifles, a machine gun and 20 hand grenades from his military unit and hid them in the outskirts of Baku, the ministry spokesman and U.S. officials said. Government security forces tracked down the group and arrested several members during a sweep on Saturday in the village of Mastaga, about 20 miles (32 km) northeast of Baku, the spokesman said. One suspected member of the militant group resisted arrest and was killed in the sweep, the spokesman said. Several others are still at large, he added. He said the terror plot also targeted Azerbaijani government buildings. The U.S. Embassy in Baku issued a warden message warning Americans in Azerbaijan to take precautions. "While there is no information at this time that other American or Western interests in Azerbaijan are being targeted, the U.S. Embassy encourages Americans to maintain a high level of vigilance and take appropriate steps to bolster their own personal security," it said. Azerbaijan is a former Soviet republic that borders the Caspian Sea, and lies just north of Iran. McCormack said U.S. authorities are working closely with their counterparts in Baku and will determine when normal embassy operations will resume. He said he expects the embassy to limit its operations on Tuesday, as well. E-mail to a friend .

chatgpt: A major Islamic terror plot against the U.S. embassy in Baku, Azerbaijan, has been uncovered by authorities. The plot, which involved the use of improvised explosive devices, was aimed at causing significant damage to the embassy and harming those inside. The United States has responded to the threat by reducing embassy operations in Baku, with staff ordered to limit their movements and avoid public places. The decision was made as a precautionary measure given the seriousness of the threat. The U.S. embassy in Baku is an important diplomatic outpost in the region, with staff working on issues ranging from security and economic cooperation to human rights and democracy. The embassy has been a target of various extremist groups in the past, including Islamist militants and Armenian separatists. The British embassy in Baku also took action in response to the threat, closing its doors to the public on Monday. The embassy remains operational, but members of the public are advised to avoid the area until further notice. The news of the terror plot has sent shockwaves through Baku and the wider region. Azerbaijan has long been seen as a relatively stable and prosperous nation, with a strong commitment to secularism and a thriving energy sector. However, the threat of terrorism looms large, with various groups seeking to undermine the country's stability and sow division among its diverse population. Islamic extremism has been a growing concern in Azerbaijan in recent years, with some observers warning that the country's secular traditions are increasingly under threat. Radical preachers have been known to spread extremist ideologies through online channels, while some young people have been lured into joining militant groups fighting in Syria and Iraq. Despite these challenges, the Azerbaijani government has taken steps to counter the threat of terrorism, including by working closely with international partners such as the United States and Britain. The country has also invested heavily in security measures, including improving intelligence capabilities and enhancing border controls. The uncovering of the recent terror plot is a reminder of the ongoing threat facing Azerbaijan and other countries in the region. It also highlights the importance of a coordinated global response to terrorism, with international cooperation and solidarity crucial in the fight against extremism. As the situation in Baku continues to develop, authorities will be working tirelessly to ensure the safety and security of embassy staff and the wider public. These efforts will be closely watched by the international community, which remains vigilant in the face of the global threat posed by terrorism.
