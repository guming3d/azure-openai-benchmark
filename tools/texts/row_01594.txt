article: Barcelona, Spain (CNN) -- Mozilla announced Sunday it will launch handsets running its new Firefox mobile operating system, pitting itself directly against Apple and Google. The nonprofit company made the announcement at a news conference on the eve of the world's largest mobile technology show, Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, under the new marketing slogan "Unleash the fox." The company says it is partnering with 18 network operators and four handset manufacturers around the world to launch handsets running its open-source mobile operating system, which it also demonstrated Sunday. Alcatel, LG and ZTE will be first to build the first Firefox OS devices, with Huawei to follow later in the year, a spokesman said. The company said the first wave of Firefox devices would go on sale beginning in July in Brazil, Colombia, Hungary, Mexico, Montenegro, Poland, Serbia, Spain and Venezuela. What features would you like to see? The new software is built on open Web standards and is capable of operating on much less sophisticated devices than many existing smartphones, the company says. "Firefox OS will break down the walls between apps and the Web because Firefox OS apps are built using Web technologies, like HTML5," said Jay Sullivan, Mozilla's senior vice president of products. "We expect to see lots of amazing apps people love built for Firefox OS because more developers are already creating for the Web than for any other platform." Developers will be free to build and sell mobile applications for the operating system without having to share revenue with Apple or Google. NYPD dedicates squad to phone thefts . John Jackson, vice president of the research company IDC, said, "The impressive lineup of operators who have now pledged to distribute Firefox OS devices speaks clearly and powerfully to the platform's potential and points to 2013 being a breakout year for Mozilla in the mobile domain. However, Stuart Miles, editor of gadget review site Pocket-lint, said while there was potential for success in developing countries, the company faced an uphill struggle against the established big players. "It's an interesting move, mainly because I think the people that are backing it are doing so to either hedge their bets or to provide leverage against the bigger players. "The idea of HTML web apps is one that Apple had five years ago with the launch of the iPhone but soon realized that they could make much more money by charging for apps rather than giving them away for free. As an organization, Mozilla doesn't have those concerns." Sleep texting is a thing . Mozilla says operators who have committed to devices include AmÃ©rica MÃ³vil, China Unicom, Deutsche Telekom, Etisalat, Hutchison Three Group, KDDI, KT, MegaFon, Qtel, SingTel, Smart, Sprint, Telecom Italia Group, TelefÃ³nica, Telenor, TMN and VimpelCom.

chatgpt: Mozilla, the non-profit organization known for its Firefox web browser, is ready to make its mark in the mobile phone industry. The company announced on Monday that it will introduce mobile phones with its Firefox open-source operating system, which will compete directly with Apple and Google on apps, according to a senior official. The new mobile phones, which will be made by four manufacturers, will be available in nine countries starting in July. The countries where these phones will be available include Venezuela, Brazil, Colombia, Poland, Hungary, Serbia, Montenegro, Spain, and Germany. The Firefox OS for mobile devices has been in the works for the past several years, and the smartphone market is a logical next step for the Mozilla team. Firefox OS is designed to be an open platform that enables developers to create mobile applications easily, and it is based entirely on existing web standards such as HTML5. These mobile phones will offer affordable options for individuals to purchase smartphones. Mozilla’s goal is to reach individuals in emerging markets who may not have experienced a smartphone before. The low-priced mobile phones will help tap into the needs of the feature phone users, which is a massive market that has been mostly untapped. "As a company, we want to disrupt the app economy with the same force as we disrupted the web world decades ago," said Jay Sullivan, Mozilla's Chief Operating Officer during a press conference. The Firefox OS has also been designed to offer a different user experience that is not typical with other major operating systems such as Google’s Android or Apple’s iOS. Mozilla wants to offer a choice and bring a new alternative to its customers who feel like they are stuck with either Android or iOS. “What makes Firefox OS different is that it is entirely open source, built with HTML5, and driven by the Web,” the organization said on its website. It appears that Mozilla is heading in a different direction from its competitors, as it is offering an affordable new smartphone platform, which also focuses on providing a reasonable third option to customers. Concerns over other mobile operating systems giant’s exclusivity, privacy, and security issues have been an undertone in the mobile phone market for years, which is now being addressed by Mozilla with Firefox OS. It remains to be seen if Mozilla’s mobile phones with Firefox OS can make a significant impact against well-established mobile operating systems such as iOS and Android. Nonetheless, the creation of affordable smartphones that are tied to an open-source operating system is a new addition to the mobile phone industry that shows promise for the future.
