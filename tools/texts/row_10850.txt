The Midlands-bound train was held up for 10 minutes as officers from British Transport Police (BTP) were called and took the women away. One witness, a 46-year-old company managing director, said: ‘I was at the barrier getting my ticket checked when two women came along who were completely paralytic. ‘One collapsed on the floor and her friend pulled her up. I could see them flashing their warrant cards and saying they were police officers.

He tried to walk away and they grabbed him by the shoulders and arms and shook him. ‘They grappled with him and stopped him getting away. Everyone watching from the first class carriage could not believe it. ‘Most people thought he was assaulted by members of the public, but I knew they were police officers. ‘It just seems ridiculous that police are so keen on jumping on other people when they are drunk but they cannot behave themselves in such a public place.’ The incident took place on platform one at Euston Station last Wednesday before the departure of the 9.43pm Wolverhampton service. One of the women, Islington PC Debra Mackrell, 37, of Milton Keynes, was later charged with common assault. She was commended by her borough commander last year for catching a suicidal woman after she jumped from a window. Her friend, a 27-year-old PC from Hitchin, Hertfordshire, was arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly and has been released on bail. All Metropolitan Police officers receive free rail travel on London Tube trains and buses whether they are on or off duty. Officers get free travel to destinations within 70 miles of the capital if they pay the monthly tax liability of either £48 or £96, depending on their salary. Virgin Trains said the train guard was shaken but not injured by the incident and was able to continue working. The Metropolitan Police said both officers have been placed on restricted duties away from the frontline. British Transport Police (BTP) said Mackrell will appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Friday July 20. Following an adjournment, the CPS have now withdrawn the charges against Ms Mackrell.

chatgpt: An off-duty police officer and a firefighter have been arrested following an altercation with a uniformed officer at Euston Station on Thursday. The incident occurred on a packed platform and led to the Midlands-bound train being held up for 10 minutes as officers from the British Transport Police (BTP) were called. The BTP issued a statement saying that one of the men had "grappled" with the uniformed officer, causing a disturbance. The two men were then arrested on suspicion of assaulting a police officer. Islington PC Debra Mackrell, 37, from Milton Keynes, was one of the off-duty officers involved and is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court next week. The other man has been named as firefighter Alan Priest, 44, from North Greenford, Ealing. It is unclear what led to the altercation, but witnesses reported hearing shouting and seeing the uniformed officer being pushed back by one of the off-duty officers. The incident caused a commotion on the platform and disrupted travel for several commuters. The BTP have stated that they take any assault against their officers very seriously and will always seek to prosecute individuals who behave in this way. A spokesperson for the London Fire Brigade said that they were aware of the incident and that it was being investigated. They declined to comment further until the investigation was concluded. This incident has once again raised concerns about the behaviour of off-duty police officers and the conduct of emergency service workers in general. It is important that all emergency service workers understand the responsibilities that come with their profession and that they conduct themselves professionally at all times, whether they are on or off duty. The BTP has been under increased scrutiny following recent incidents of violence and anti-social behaviour on the rail network. The force has been stepping up patrols on trains and stations in an effort to curb this behaviour. In response to this incident, the BTP has vowed to continue to take a zero-tolerance approach to any behaviour that threatens the safety of their officers or disrupts the travel of passengers. As the investigation into this incident continues, it is hoped that the individuals involved will come to understand the gravity of their actions and will take the necessary steps to rectify the situation. The behaviour of all emergency service workers is critical to ensuring the safety and well-being of the public, and incidents such as this can have a detrimental impact on the trust that is placed in these professionals. Ultimately, it is up to all emergency service workers to uphold the high standards of their profession and serve as role models for others.
