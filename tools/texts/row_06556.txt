article: (CNN) -- A news anchor and four other people were killed on Monday in a suicide bombing after armed militants stormed a TV complex in Tikrit, Iraq, police said. The violence unfolded when a car bomb exploded outside Salaheddin TV and the local offices of al Iraqiya state TV in Tikrit, a major city in Salaheddin province north of Baghdad. Militants then stormed the offices and a suicide bomber killed five employees inside Salaheddin TV, including a female anchor and the head of its news department, police said. At least two attackers wore explosive vests. Security forces arrived at the scene, fought the attackers and regained control of the building, police said. Authorities imposed a curfew on Tikrit, and Salaheddin TV stopped broadcasting until further notice. Political and sectarian violence has plagued Iraq throughout the year, with thousands of deaths reported. Tensions have pervaded the Sunni community, which has felt marginalized by the Shiite-dominated government. Iraq's unrest reaches world of journalism . Journalists haven't been immune from the terror. Before the latest violence, Irina Bokova, director-general of the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, denounced the killings of eight journalists in Iraq this year. "Violence against media workers undermines the ability of journalists to carry out their work freely as well as the right of citizens to receive the independent information they need," Bokova said. The Committee to Protect Journalists, a watchdog group, said in a report this month that journalists have been subjected to threats and killings. The report focused on unrest in Mosul, the religiously and ethnically diverse city in Iraq's north. "These killings are a significant deterioration from 2012, a landmark year in which no journalists were killed for their work in Iraq for the first time since the 2003 American invasion," the report said. "That brief reprieve was part of a larger decrease in overall political violence, but that reprieve now seems to be over. And just as the underlying causes of political violence in Iraq were never resolved, neither have the underlying drivers of violence against journalists. There are simply too many triggermen ready to silence journalists, knowing full well that there is little that can stop them." Other violence . Violence occurred in other regions of Iraq on Monday, police said. At least six soldiers were killed when mortar rounds landed on a military base near Baghdad. Four people died when gunmen attacked pet stores in southern Baghdad, and three people died when a bomb exploded in an outdoor market in the northwestern part of the Iraqi capital, police said. Three people died in shootings in Mosul, and an attack on a bus in Baquba, northeast of Baghdad, left three others dead, police said.

chatgpt: A suicide bomber has targeted a TV station in the city of Tikrit, killing five employees and injuring several others. The attack took place on Tuesday morning, and it has prompted authorities to impose a curfew in the area. The TV station has stopped broadcasting for the time being. The attacker purportedly entered the station, which is located in downtown Tikrit, and detonated his explosive vest. The station was broadcasting at the time, and the blast ripped through the building, causing widespread damage. The attack has been claimed by an extremist group, although this has not been independently confirmed. This latest incident is one of several attacks that have occurred in and around Baghdad, Mosul, and Baquba over the past few days. At least 19 other people have been reported dead as a result of separate bombings and shootings. These incidents have fueled concerns over the security situation in Iraq, which has deteriorated significantly in recent months. The United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) have condemned the threats and killings of journalists in the country. The attack on the TV station in Tikrit is just the latest in a series of incidents targeting media outlets and journalists in Iraq. In a statement, UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay expressed concern over the violence and called on authorities to do more to protect journalists and ensure that their work can be carried out without fear of reprisals. "Freedom of expression is a fundamental human right and a key component of any democratic society," she said. The CPJ has also called for urgent action to protect journalists in Iraq. "The attacks on journalists and media outlets in this country are completely unacceptable and must be stopped," said CPJ Executive Director Joel Simon. "The authorities have a duty to ensure that those responsible for these crimes are brought to justice." The recent attacks have prompted renewed calls for the Iraqi government to take stronger action to tackle the security situation in the country. Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi has vowed to crack down on extremist groups and improve security, but many Iraqis are skeptical of these promises given the country's long history of violence and instability. For now, the situation remains tense, and authorities are urging people to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity. The attack on the TV station in Tikrit serves as a stark reminder of the dangers faced by journalists and the ongoing security challenges in Iraq.
