The attack left her with serious injuries and there is potential that she will be left with permanent scarring as a result of the unprovoked violence. According to reports, Leanne was approached by three men who proceeded to kick her legs and body repeatedly as she lay on the floor. The attackers then fled the scene of the crime with Leanne's bag.

The brutal attack has shocked the community and many are calling for justice to be served. Leanne's family and friends have been left devastated by the incident and are urging anyone with any information to come forward and speak to the police. Chief Inspector Mark Colquhoun, who is leading the investigation, has condemned the attack and has vowed to bring those responsible to justice.
