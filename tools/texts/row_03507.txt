article: (CNN) -- A controversial exhibition featuring preserved corpses having sex opened Thursday in Germany's capital. Gunther von Hagens' controversial "Body Works" shows have traveled throughout the world. Part of his traveling "Body Works" exhibition, "The Cycle of Life," is showing at Berlin's Postbahnhof and features 200 human bodies at various life stages -- from conception to old age, including embryos and fetuses taken from historic anatomical collections. In one exhibit a male body is lying on his back with a woman sitting astride him with her back towards his head. Torsten Woehlert, spokesman for Berlin's Culture Ministry, told CNN that there has already been a number of complaints from the public in the press, though none have come to the ministry itself. He said: "As it is not against the law, only against good taste, there is not much the government could do anyway." Conceived by Gunther von Hagens -- dubbed Dr. Death in Germany -- the exhibition displays the bodies with their muscles, nerves and tendons on show using a preservation technique he pioneered called plastination. This process involves replacing all body fluids and soluble fat with specially manufactured plastics. On his Web site, the anatomist describes the exhibition's purpose and goal "to reveal and expose the anatomical structure of the human body and its function, in a unique lesson, and to teach us about the complexity of the human body, its anatomy, and the importance of leading a healthy way of life." What do you think? He added that the source of the exhibition is from donors -- people, who during their lifetime, declared their willingness, by informed consent, to display their bodies at the exhibition for the "benefit of education, health and the awareness of the wide public to the different systems of the human body." When asked about the coupling of sex and death, von Hagens told Germany's Bild that "death and sex are both taboo topics. I'm bringing them together. Death belongs to life." He added that "without sex no life would exist." Von Hagens' work has divided opinion in the past, with critics often doubting his scientific motives and accusing him of shocking people to gain publicity. His public autopsy in 2002 for British broadcaster Channel 4 -- the first in the UK for 170 years -- received hundreds of complaints. The authorities also threatened to arrest him after declaring the procedure illegal. Von Hagens justified his actions as "demystifying the post mortem examination," and likened the medical profession to "medieval priests who would not allow ordinary people to read the Bible," The New Scientist reported.

chatgpt: London, UK - Cycle of Life, a groundbreaking exhibition featuring 200 human bodies at various life stages, has opened in London. The exhibit, created by anatomist Gunther von Hagens, showcases the complexity of the human body in ways never seen before. One of the most controversial exhibits features a male body lying on his back with a female astride him. The exhibit portrays the act of coitus in a lifelike manner and has attracted both criticism and interest. Von Hagens claims that the exhibit is not intended to be provocative, but rather to showcase the complexity of the human body during sexual intercourse. The exhibition, which has been in development for over a decade, includes specimens of all ages, from a fetus in the womb to an elderly person. The bodies have undergone a process called plastination, in which they are preserved and dissected to reveal detailed anatomical structures. Speaking about the exhibition, von Hagens said, "Cycle of Life is our attempt to communicate the beauty and complexity of the human body. Each specimen is a testament to the miracle of life and highlights the uniqueness of each individual." The German anatomist is no stranger to controversy. In 2002, he performed the first public autopsy in the UK in over 170 years. The event, which was broadcast on television, attracted a lot of criticism from the medical community and the public. Von Hagens defended the autopsy, saying, "I believe that the educational value of seeing a human body being dissected is invaluable. It teaches us about the complexity of the human body and can help us appreciate our own bodies." Critics of the exhibition argue that it is unethical and disrespectful to display human bodies in such a manner. Some have called for the exhibit to be shut down, citing concerns about the ethics of obtaining the bodies used in the exhibition. However, von Hagens maintains that all the bodies on display were donated for educational purposes, and that each donor gave explicit consent for their body to be used in this manner. Cycle of Life is not just a display of human anatomy. It is also an opportunity for visitors to learn about the different diseases and conditions that affect the human body. Several exhibits showcase organs and tissues affected by cancer, Alzheimer's disease and other conditions. Despite the controversy, Cycle of Life has already attracted a lot of interest from the public. The exhibition is expected to draw large crowds over the coming months, with visitors coming from all over the world to see the unique displays. As von Hagens puts it, "Cycle of Life is not just an exhibition, it is a celebration of the human body and all its complexities. We hope that visitors will leave with a greater appreciation for the miracle of life and a deeper understanding of the beauty and fragility of the human body."
