'He was coming, as people do, in order to find work and to provide for his wife and child in Romania. 'He had been told when he came over here there would be a job available for him and that work would be well paid, but the reality was very different.' Mr Roberts told the court Calin had been cajoled into being the ‘fall guy’ by a group of others who said by stealing the whisky it would answer his money troubles. The goods were all recovered in a re-saleable condition, and the court was told Calin now had the promise of a job in a car wash in Leigh, where he is living with his sister. Calin was given an eight-week curfew from 7pm to 7am, and ordered to pay court costs of £85 and a £60 victim surcharge. The court was told he could not undertake unpaid work as his English was not good enough to understand health and safety information.

chatgpt: A man from Barrow-in-Furness has been caught stealing more than £1,000 worth of whisky from a local supermarket. Simon Calin, 37, was stopped by police as he loaded up his car with bottles of Famous Grouse. The theft occurred on February 12th and Calin was subsequently charged with theft and failing to surrender. Calin, who moved to the UK from Romania on January 2nd, has no job or money. According to Furness Magistrates Court, the married father of one was hoping to sell the stolen whisky to make some quick cash. The court also heard that Calin had no previous criminal record in his home country. During his trial, Calin admitted to the theft and failing to surrender. He was given a curfew and fined for his actions. However, he managed to avoid doing unpaid work as his English was not good enough to understand the health and safety instructions. This case has sparked outrage among locals who are concerned about rising levels of crime in the area. Many are calling for stricter measures to be put in place to deter would-be thieves from targeting local businesses. Speaking to reporters, a spokesperson for the supermarket chain where the theft occurred said: "We take the issue of theft very seriously and will not tolerate any criminal activity on our premises. We are working closely with the police to ensure that justice is served." The case has also brought attention to the plight of immigrant communities in the UK, many of whom struggle to find work due to language barriers and discrimination. In light of this, Calin is now hoping to find work at a local car wash. Despite the circumstances of the case, Magistrates were keen to stress the severity of the crime, stating that theft is a serious offence and will not be tolerated. They also noted that Calin's lack of criminal record and early guilty plea were taken into account when considering his sentence. This case serves as a reminder that theft is a serious crime and can result in severe consequences. It also highlights the difficulties faced by immigrant communities in the UK and the importance of providing support and assistance to those who need it.
