article: (EW.com) -- In the late 1950s, a young singer called Ernest Evans began going by the name of Chubby Checker, a handle bestowed in part by Dick Clark's wife (seriously!). Because it was a less vulgar time, nobody thought to warn young Chubby that his new moniker was just begging to be used as a lame double entendre (example: "Chubby Checker? I barely know 'er!"). But 60-odd years later, times have most definitely changed. Celebrities show off their female breast nipples all willy-nilly, despite strict orders from the suits at CBS. Nobody really gives a fâ€” when somebody drops an f-bomb on national TV during the year's most-watched program. And not too long ago, some jokester thought it'd be funny to make an app called "The Chubby Checker," which promises to predict the size of a man's Sammy Davis Jr. based on what size shoe he wears. EW: J.Lo saves Adele from huskster . Naturally, Checker wasn't pleased when he found out about the app's existence â€” and now he's filing a $500,000,000 trademark infringement lawsuit against Hewlett Packard due to the "irreparable damage and harm" caused by this goofy little novelty. EW: 'Jeopardy' goes all out with 'Call Me Maybe' clues . The twist: The app was removed from all Palm and HP-hosted web sites in September 2012, and the operating system that runs it was discontinued even before then in August 2011. So Checker is asking for half a billion dollars on account of something that cost $.99, was downloaded a grand total of 84 times, and would have faded away quietly and completely if not for this headline-grabbing lawsuit. Bad move, Chubs; you'll never get kinged if this is the way you play. See the original story at EW.com.

chatgpt: The infamous "Chubby Checker" app has come under fire for its controversial claims and alleged infringement of the rights of the legendary singer of the same name. The app, which promised to predict the size of a certain body part based on shoe size, was removed from the marketplace years ago but its impact can still be felt. The app was released in 2006, and within just two months, was downloaded over 70,000 times. The app's name, which evoked the popular dance craze of the early 1960s, was adopted by the singer as his nickname in the late 1950s. Chubby Checker, whose real name is Ernest Evans, was not amused by the app's name and its suggestive use of his moniker. In 2013, Checker filed a lawsuit against Hewlett-Packard and Palm Inc., the companies that had produced and distributed the app. Checker's lawsuit claimed that the app "irreparably harms Chubby Checker's reputation" and that he was "damaged in a way that cannot be adequately compensated by monetary damages alone." The lawsuit sought $500 million in damages. Following the lawsuit, the app was removed from the marketplace, but Checker did not stop there. In an interview with the BBC, he made it clear that he was not satisfied with just having the app removed. He said, "I don't want people to go in there and think that Chubby Checker condones this activity. I don't." As of today, the app is no longer available for download, but Checker's legal battle is far from over. He still awaits a final judgment on his lawsuit against the tech giants.  In conclusion, the "Chubby Checker" app's controversial claims and alleged infringement of the singer's rights have not gone unnoticed. As tech continues to advance, it is important for companies to ensure that their products are respectful and do not cause harm to individuals or groups. The legal repercussions of the app serve as a reminder of this responsibility.
