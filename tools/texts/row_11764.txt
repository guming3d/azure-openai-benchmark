article: A Canadian artist had more than a dozen of priceless instruments smashed to pieces by US customs after officials ruled they posed an ‘ecological threat’. Virtuoso flutist Boujemaa Razgui only discovered that his instruments had been destroyed when his luggage never arrived at his final destination in Boston and he was told customs in New York had confiscated the flutes. US customs are refusing to apologise to Mr Razgui, claiming they were acting in the interests of American agriculture. Canadian artist Boujemaa Razgui has 13 hand crafted instruments destroyed without warning by US customs who are refusing to apologise for their actions . Mr Razgui’s luggage contained 13 rare hand-crafted instruments - 11 nay flutes and two kawalas – as well as dried bamboo to use when building more instruments. Mr Razgui, a Canadian national living in Boston, was travelling from Madrid to his home town via JFK Airport in New York. Upon arrival, he found that his bags were missing. When he returned to the airport the following day, staff in Boston said the bags had been searched at JFK and his ‘agricultural products’ destroyed. 'I’ve been doing this for 26 years – travelling with my instruments and material to make instruments – and nothing like this has ever happened,' the Moroccan-born musician told The Globe and Mail. Mr Razgui was travelling to Boston via JFK Airport (pictured) where his bags were searched and the flutes deemed 'agricultural products' and taken by customs . 'They never gave me an opportunity to explain. These instruments are priceless to me. I make them with my own hands and I can’t make a living without them,' he said. U.S. Customs and Border Protection have said they will not apologize for destroying the flutes without contacting Mr Razgui, claiming that the bamboo was fresh, not dried, and therefore posed a risk. ‘The fresh bamboo canes were seized and destroyed in accordance with established protocols to prevent the introduction of plant pathogens into the United States,’ an official said.

chatgpt: Renowned artist and musician Boujemaa Razgui was left heartbroken after 13 rare instruments were confiscated and destroyed by US customs officials. The artist was en route to Boston on a flight from Marrakech when he discovered the loss of his prized possessions. Upon arrival at New York's JFK airport, Razgui was informed that his luggage had been detained by officials for further examination. To his surprise, a search of his bags revealed the presence of 13 bamboo flutes, which were promptly confiscated and destroyed. The instruments were deemed to be "agricultural products," a label that subjected them to strict customs regulations. Despite his protestations, Razgui's pleas for the safe return of his precious instruments fell on deaf ears. The confiscated flutes were not only a significant loss to Razgui, but also to the global music community. The artist is renowned for his exceptional artistry and skill in playing such rare instruments, often drawing inspiration from the diverse cultural traditions of his homeland of Morocco. His flutes featured unique designs, varying sizes, and incredible sound quality. Razgui had collected them over many years from around the world, and he had hoped to share their beauty and significance with audiences in Boston. The loss of these bamboo flutes is a wake-up call for the need to protect the freedom of artists and their work when crossing borders. These rare instruments were more than just commodities; they were symbols of cultural heritage and artistic expression that are invaluable to our global community. The incident also underscores the urgent need for governments to review and revise their customs regulations to ensure that artistic and cultural items are not wrongly labeled and destroyed. Such items should be treated with the utmost respect and care, not merely as agricultural products.  Boujemaa Razgui's story is a sad reminder of the cost of neglecting the significance of art, culture, and tradition in our increasingly interconnected world. Hopefully, justice will be served and future artists will not have to experience the same pain and loss.
