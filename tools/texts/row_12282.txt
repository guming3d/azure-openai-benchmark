chatgpt: Germany's defender Per Mertesacker has expressed his anger at critics who compared his side to a "Mickey Mouse team" following their narrow victory over Algeria on Monday. Mertesacker stated that all that mattered in the end was the fact that Germany managed to secure a place in the quarterfinals of the World Cup. Despite the victory, Germany's defence was often exposed, and it was only due to the spectacular performance of goalkeeper Manuel Neuer that they were saved from conceding earlier on in the match. However, Mertesacker dismissed suggestions that Germany's style of play was not good enough, stating that winning the game was more important. In a post-match interview, a journalist asked Mertesacker about whether he felt that Germany's style of play was too defensive and not pleasing to watch. To this, Mertesacker responded by asking the journalist whether he would rather that Germany played beautiful football and got knocked out of the tournament. Mertesacker's views were echoed by his fellow teammates, who also emphasized that winning was the most important thing at this stage of the tournament. German midfielder, Toni Kroos, pointed out that in such a high-pressure tournament, it was important for teams to be pragmatic and focused on the outcome rather than the style of play. The German side has been plagued by injuries in the lead-up to the World Cup, with key players such as Marco Reus, Mario Gomez and Sami Khedira all ruled out due to injury. This has forced the team to change their tactics and focus on their defensive capabilities. Despite this, Mertesacker believes that the team still has a lot to offer and that they can still go on to win the tournament. However, he emphasized that the team would need to improve their performance going forward. In the quarterfinals, Germany will face France, who have been in impressive form in the tournament so far. The match promises to be a tough encounter, with both teams evenly matched. For Germany, it will be a chance to prove their critics wrong and demonstrate that they are still a force to be reckoned with in world football.
