A fraudster conned his local community out of thousands of pounds by pretending he had a brain tumour – which he had diagnosed himself on the internet. Gareth Wyn Francis asked local people to fund £28,000 of treatment to help him survive a brain tumour. A local church donated £1,000, while well-wishers organised raffles and collections for him. His own brother even climbed the three peaks of England, Scotland and Wales to raise money for his fictional fund. But it was revealed that he did not need the money and even spent £12,800 on decorating his house. Francis also began walking with a stick and trailing his leg behind him, claiming it was a side effect of his treatment, and shaved off his eyebrows and hair saying it happened because of chemotherapy. Francis was caught out after his worried family went to his GP saying they thought he was about to die, but were told he was not receiving any treatment. When they confronted Francis, he broke down and confessed. Frank Phillips, for Francis, of Clos Cilsaig in Dafen, said his client had been suffering headaches but instead of going to his GP he went online and self-diagnosed. 'By the time he realised, the ball was rolling and he could not find a way of stopping it,' he told Swansea Crown Court. Conned: Swansea Crown Court heard his local church donated £1,000 . Convicted: Francis received a 16 month suspended jail term at Swansea Crown Court, and was told to complete 250 hours of unpaid work . He said his client’s relationship had broken down and he had been left with debts. He said the local community now had 'grave' feelings towards him. Judge Peter Heywood told him although he could jail him immediately, he wanted him to serve a sentence in the community. He told Francis: 'You even conned members of your own family. Your illness was a complete myth. 'Instead of going to your doctor you went on the internet and self-diagnosed yourself. It was utter nonsense that you had a brain tumour.' Francis’s 16 month jail term was suspended for two years, he was also told to complete 250 hours of unpaid work.

chatgpt: Gareth Wyn Francis, a resident of Swansea, made headlines recently after being convicted of three counts of fraud at Swansea Crown Court. The charges relate to his false claims for funding from a local church and the local council. Francis, 35, claimed to have been diagnosed with a serious illness and was seeking help to pay for his treatment. He initially approached a local church, who donated £1,000 to help him cover his medical bills. However, it soon became apparent that Francis had lied about his diagnosis and had instead spent the money on decorating his house. He claimed to have found a cure for his 'illness' through online research and had used the remaining funds to fund his home renovation. During the investigation, it emerged that Francis had also fraudulently claimed £12,800 from the local council in disability benefits. He had fabricated his illness and presented false medical documents to support his claim. Prosecutors argued that Francis had 'preyed upon the goodwill of others' and had shown a 'cavalier attitude towards public funds'. The judge agreed, stating that his crimes were 'serious and deliberate breaches of trust' that had caused harm to both the church and the council. Francis was sentenced to 18 months in prison for the fraud charges. The judge said that he hoped the sentence would serve as a warning to others who might be tempted to defraud the public or charity organizations. The local church, which had been deceived by Francis's lies, expressed dismay at the extent of his dishonesty. The pastor of the church said that they had been 'fooled by his deception' and had trusted him based on his claims of being genuinely unwell. The case has raised concerns about the ease with which individuals can now access medical information online and use it to deceive others for financial gain. There are calls for greater scrutiny of claims for charitable or public funds to ensure that they are legitimate and that the money is being used for its intended purpose. Overall, the case serves as a warning to anyone who may be tempted to deceive others for personal gain. Gareth Wyn Francis's downfall demonstrates that such actions are not only morally reprehensible but also carry significant legal consequences.
