chatgpt: Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere has returned to training earlier than usual, after his holidays following the World Cup. The England international, who has come under criticism in recent days after being spotted appearing to smoke while in Las Vegas, posted a picture of himself from training on Instagram alongside the hashtag #WilshWillBeReady. Wilshere's return to training ahead of schedule is a positive sign for Arsenal ahead of the new season, which begins on August 16th. The Gunners have been linked with a number of midfielders this summer, but manager Arsene Wenger has maintained that he is happy with the current squad. Meanwhile, Arsenal forward Theo Walcott is also making progress on his return to fitness after a serious knee injury in January. The 25-year-old has refused to set a date on his comeback, but says he is "really pleased" with his progress over the summer. Walcott's return will provide a significant boost for Arsenal, who struggled for goals at times last season. The England international scored five goals in 13 Premier League appearances before his injury, and his pace and directness will be a welcome addition to Wenger's attacking options. Despite their early returns to training, both Wilshere and Walcott are likely to miss Arsenal's opening game of the season against Crystal Palace. Wenger is likely to take a cautious approach with both players, given their recent injury problems. The return of both players will be key for Arsenal as they look to build on last season's fourth-place finish. With the signings of Alexis Sanchez and Mathieu Debuchy, as well as the emergence of young talents like Calum Chambers and Hector Bellerin, the Gunners will be hoping to mount a serious challenge for the Premier League title this season. However, with Manchester City, Chelsea and Manchester United all strengthening their squads over the summer, Wenger will know that his side will face a tough task to bring silverware back to the Emirates. In the meantime, Wilshere will be hoping to put his off-field troubles behind him and focus on his football. The 22-year-old has been involved in a number of controversies in recent years, and will be hoping to make a positive impact for both Arsenal and England in the coming months. As for Walcott, the focus will be on his recovery and ensuring that he returns to the form that made him one of Arsenal's most dangerous attacking threats. With competition for places in the Arsenal squad hotter than ever, the pressure will be on both players to perform to their best as they look to help their side challenge for honours this season.
