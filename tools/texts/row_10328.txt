Denise Breen-Lawton said the 21-year-old had been doing 'eyeball shots' - in which he poured vodka directly into his eye in order to get drunk more quickly. During the evening people at the party played spin the bottle and the victim had ended up in just her underwear. The court heard the teenager then decided to go to bed because she felt sleepy. Ward went into the bedroom later in the evening and laid beside her in bed, before asking the girl if he could have sex with her  - but she refused. At around 7.30am the next morning she awoke to find Ward having sex with her. He was arrested after the girl told her parents about what had happened.

He said Ward accepted that he would be facing a lengthy prison sentence. Mr Alexander said Ward was 'keen' to receive help while in custody to address his offending behaviour. Judge Neil Clark told Ward he must serve five years in custody followed by a period on licence for a further five years. He said: 'It is clear that you have ruined her life in many ways. I only hope that the passage of time will help with her recovery.' The judge added: 'You present a high risk of harm to females. It is of note that on both occasions you placed blame at the door of your victims.'

chatgpt: Mitchel Ward, a 21-year-old man, has been jailed after a judge deemed him a "serious danger" to women. The verdict follows a harrowing incident in which Ward climbed into bed with a drunk girl and proceeded to rape her, despite her explicit refusal. The victim awoke hours later to find herself being assaulted by Ward, who initially denied any wrongdoing. He went as far as labelling the victim as "a strange one". The incident took place in the middle of the night, as the victim was sleeping at a friend's house. Ward reportedly entered the house, made his way to the bedroom where the victim was sleeping, and climbed into bed. He then asked the victim to have sex with him, but she declined the offer.  Despite her rejection, Ward sexually assaulted the victim, who only realised what was happening hours later when she woke up to find Ward on top of her. The traumatic experience left her shaken and humiliated.  Ward initially denied any wrongdoing, despite forensic evidence linking him to the offence. However, he eventually pleaded guilty to the crime of rape. At his sentencing hearing, the judge noted that Ward had a previous conviction for having sex with a 13-year-old girl in 2009, demonstrating a longstanding pattern of predatory behaviour.  Accordingly, the judge sentenced Ward to a lengthy term of imprisonment, describing him as a "serious danger" to women. The case has shone a light on the issue of sexual assault and the importance of taking every allegation seriously.  This case highlights the importance of raising awareness and educating people about the prevalence of sexual assault, the devastating impact it can have on victims, and the need to encourage victims to come forward and report incidents. It also stresses the importance of ensuring that anyone who violates another person's bodily autonomy is held accountable for their actions. Ultimately, the case of Mitchel Ward is a tragic reminder of the evil that lurks in society and the importance of having strict laws to protect the vulnerable. Justice has been served, but it is important that we all remain vigilant against those who seek to do harm to others. It is our duty to speak up, stand up and support victims wherever possible.
