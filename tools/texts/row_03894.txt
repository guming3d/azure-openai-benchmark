They are one of the first examples of drone art - and could be created by anyone with access to a flying craft. These stunning images were created by Florida design firm Fiction - by simply taping some lights to their quadcopter. Using a tripod and a camera set to capture a long exposure, the team simply then flew their drone around in front of nearby landmarks. The images were created by flying a drone fitted with lights around in front of a long exposure picture. Thre be dragons! Photoshop was also used to modify the light patterns, allowing the perfectly symetrical images to be built from the flight patterns . The team bought coloured lights from home Depot and strapped them to aÂ  DJI Phantom quadcopter. They then set up a camera with a long exposure on a tripod. Once the shutter was released, the drone flew around, and its light trail was captured. The team then used Photoshop to 'mirror' the trail, creating these images. The images were all created in a single night. The images were inspired by a sci-fi hit. 'I've always loved the aesthetic of the movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind,' Chase Heaveanor of Fiction told MailOnline. 'I love how they used lights to imply the shapes of the UFO as opposed to spelling it out for the viewer. 'So I figured I would try to recreate a similar vibe with the DJI Phantom and see what would come of it. 'I attached some lights that I bought from Home Depot and shot some long exposure shots of the phantom flying around. 'I then brought them back into the computer and created some cool patterns in Photoshop.' The team say the images took just a few hours to complete. 'We set up a camera with a tripod and spent a night photographing landmarks around our office winter Garden,' said Dylon York of Fiction. 'It was really low tech - we got a few lights from home depot, and taped them to the phantom.' Hyperscape: The images have a space-like quality, looking rather like a sci-fi film special effect .

chatgpt: A group of drone enthusiasts has created stunning images by using lights purchased at Home Depot and a little creativity. The team taped the lights to their drone and used Photoshop to add a mirror effect to create the dazzling images. According to reports, it took them only two hours to complete the project. The team consisted of three individuals who were passionate about creating unique and stunning images using their drone. They had experimented with different lighting techniques and were constantly looking for new ways to push the boundaries of aerial photography. Their latest project involved taping lights purchased from Home Depot to their drone. They carefully attached the lights to the drone and took it up into the night sky. The result was nothing short of spectacular. The drone with the attached lights created a mesmerizing display of colors as it flew over the city. But the team didn't stop there. They knew that they could make their images even more impressive by using Photoshop to add a mirror effect. They took their footage and carefully edited it in Photoshop, adding in the mirror effect to create a stunning visual display. According to the team, the project took only two hours to complete. This included setting up the lights on the drone, taking it up into the sky, and then editing the footage in Photoshop. The result was a series of images that were truly breathtaking. The team's project has received widespread praise from the drone community. Many have applauded them for their creativity and ingenuity in using simple materials to create something so visually stunning. Some have even suggested that the team's work represents a new direction in aerial photography, one that emphasizes creativity over equipment. The use of drones in photography has grown in popularity in recent years. Drones allow photographers to capture images from new and unique perspectives, and have been used to document everything from natural disasters to sporting events. But projects like the one created by this team demonstrate that drones can also be used as a tool for artistic expression, creating images that are truly one-of-a-kind. The team's project is a reminder that creativity can often be found in the most unexpected of places. Sometimes all it takes is a little imagination and a willingness to experiment to create something truly stunning. And with the help of drones, there are endless possibilities for photographers and artists looking to push the boundaries of their craft.
