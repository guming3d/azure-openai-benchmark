article: (CNN) -- For centuries, Ras Al Khamiah was a strategic outpost along the ancient silk road trading route. Today, the northernmost of the seven emirates that make up the UAE is often overlooked alongside its extravagant neighbors of Dubai and Abu Dhabi. All that could be set to change, however, with the ruling Al Qasimi family set to make a big push in the region's burgeoning residential and tourism sectors.

By the end of 2014, Ras Al Khamiah (or RAK as it is often known) will have some 4,800 hotel rooms, a 60% expansion from the start of last year. The government says occupancy is currently running at 73% for beachfront resorts and revenue per room rose a solid 39% in three years. Vice president of operations at Hilton, Christian Grage, believes these rising numbers are only the beginning of what's possible in RAK. The Hotel giant has been in the emirate for more than a dozen years and opened a branch of the Waldorf Astoria there last August. "We actually are not necessarily surprised about what has come," Grage said. "I would describe it as if you build it they will come. I think we have anticipated the opportunity."

To help fill out RAKs new capacity, Air Arabia, a fast growing budget carrier, is set to move in to replace a struggling local airline. The hope is this partnership will help provide easy access to RAK from the likes of India and Saudi Arabia. A group of international travel experts, meanwhile, are fine tuning a grand master plan to ensure that demand is aligned with all the new hotel and residential inventory coming on stream. The first results of this strategy can be seen at the Al Hamra village where more than 1,000 luxury villas have been already sold to property investors from around the world.

With prices starting at $1.3 million at entry level and rising to $8 million at the top end, however, investment in Al Hamra doesn't come cheap. These prices equate to a maximum price of $3,800 per square meter ($353 per sq ft), but General Manager of the development, Benoy Kurien, said he is maintaining a sizable discount compared to prices in Dubai. "(This represents) 20-30% cheaper rates per square meter for any property you buy whether it's an apartment or a villa and that is significant value without compromising," Kurien said. The early signs are promising, but whether this rising emirate succeeds in its plans will depend on continued growth as new properties and facilities are completed.

chatgpt: The emirate of Ras Al Khaimah (RAK) is currently in the midst of an exciting transformation as luxury real estate takes over the area. Often overlooked alongside its neighboring emirates of Dubai and Abu Dhabi, RAK is now catching the eye of both developers and international hotel brands who are flocking to the region to build new facilities and residences.  The area's development potential has been recognized worldwide, with many new projects currently underway. Some of the most notable projects include the RAK Beach Resort, which will feature an array of luxury amenities, including private beaches, infinity pools, and a state-of-the-art spa. The resort will be developed by Indian firm, Regal FZC and is expected to be completed by 2022. In addition to the beach resort, several international hotel chains are also setting up shop in RAK. This includes Hilton Worldwide, who recently opened a new DoubleTree by Hilton resort in the area. The beachfront property features 154 rooms, each with their private balcony, a pool, and a variety of dining options for guests. Similarly, Waldorf Astoria has also announced plans to develop a new resort in the area, which is expected to open in 2023. The luxury hotel will feature 350 rooms and suites, a private beach, and a variety of dining options, making it a premier hotspot for both local and international tourists. But it's not only hotels that are looking to cash in on the luxury real estate boom. Developers are also keen to make their mark in the region, with a variety of high-end residential properties currently in the works.  One such property is the Al Hamra Village, which is located in the heart of RAK. The development covers an area of 77 million square feet and features several residential and commercial developments, as well as an 18-hole championship golf course. Additionally, the village also has private marinas, shops, and leisure facilities, making it an ideal location for residents seeking a vibrant and luxurious lifestyle. The rapid transformation of RAK's luxury property market has been fueled by several factors. One such factor is the emirate's strategic location, which makes it an ideal destination for tourists and investors alike. Additionally, RAK's government is proactively involved in boosting development in the area through various initiatives, including tax breaks and subsidies, further driving interest from businesses and developers. Despite being a small emirate, RAK is quickly becoming a major player in the luxury real estate market, with the potential to rival its neighbors Dubai and Abu Dhabi. With its stunning coastlines, varied terrain, and state-of-the-art facilities, the area is a great investment opportunity for investors seeking a high return on investment.  As the world continues to shift towards luxury living, RAK is an ideal destination for those seeking a premium lifestyle, and with the ongoing developments in the area, it's only set to become more desirable in the years to come.
