Diligently falling in line behind their mother, this group of ducklings has swum into the record books. Despite laying her eggs in sub-zero temperatures at the beginning of March, a mother gave birth to 24 healthy chicks - thought to be the largest brood ever recorded. The female was pictured with her two-dozen bundles of fluff at the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust’s reserve in Arundel, West Sussex, after 28 days of incubating the eggs.

Record-breaker: This mallard duck has given birth to a record-breaking 24 young ducklings . But the chicks will face another monumental task collectively making it to adulthood, with their inability to fly making them easy prey for pike and birds such as herons. The previous record for the largest brood of ducks is thought to have been set in Oklahoma in the US, where a female hatched 22 ducklings. In the UK, the largest known brood was recorded in Hazelbury, Dorset, by photographer Brian Moore, who discovered the huge group of 21 ducklings in his son’s garden pond. After hatching, ducklings usually stay in their nest for around ten hours where they stretch out their legs and dry off. The youngsters are usually led to water the morning after birth, depending on their mother for between 50 and 60 days before they become independent.

chatgpt: Incredible news out of a small pond in Oklahoma, as it has been confirmed that a mother duck managed to hatch and raise a brood of 23 ducklings. This achievement surpasses the previous record for the largest ever brood of ducks, which was also set in Oklahoma and consisted of 22 ducklings. The mother duck responsible for raising this impressive brood has been closely observed by wildlife experts, who attribute her success to good health, access to a plentiful food supply, and perhaps a bit of luck. Duck eggs are particularly vulnerable to predators, and it is rare for more than a handful to hatch and survive. Now that the ducklings have hatched, they will spend the next 50 to 60 days with their mother, learning important survival skills such as how to forage for food and how to avoid danger. Once this period has passed, the young ducks will become independent and will be ready to begin their own lives in the wild. This news has been met with excitement by locals, who have been following the mother duck's progress closely ever since her brood began to grow. Some have already begun to nickname her "Supermom" in recognition of her extraordinary achievement. The record-breaking brood of ducklings is also attracting attention from researchers, who are interested in studying the genetic factors that contribute to the mother duck's success. By analyzing her DNA and comparing it to that of other ducks, they hope to gain insights into how to improve the survival rates of wild duck populations. Despite the excitement surrounding this news, experts caution that this success story is still very much the exception rather than the rule. Duck populations across North America are in decline, with habitat loss, climate change, and pollution all contributing to the decline. While this mother duck's brood is certainly a cause for celebration, it is important that efforts continue to protect and conserve duck populations and their habitats. In the meantime, residents of Oklahoma can continue to marvel at the sight of a mother duck leading her 23 adorable ducklings on daily adventures through the pond. It is a heartwarming example of the tenacity and resilience of wildlife in the face of adversity, and a reminder of the beauty and wonder that can be found in even the smallest corners of the natural world.
