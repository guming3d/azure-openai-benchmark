article: From the outside, Italy's Credem Bank looks just like any other high security operation. And indeed, behind the barbed wire and electronic fence are piles of golden blocks. But they are not made of precious metal -- rather, they are ageing wheels of Parmesan cheese. As I walk inside, I am hit by the pungent smell and then, by the size of the vaults. Row after row, stacked up twenty shelves high, are 430,000 parmesan wheels. They're worth up to 190 million euros. The wheels are stored here as part of a cash-for-cheese loan that started with Credem bank, but dates back to the Medici era. Watch more: Historic German film studio faces challenges . In simple terms, the bank takes the cheese from local parmesan producers in exchange for a cheap loan. It charges between 3% to 5% interest, depending on the quality of the cheese, and a fee for making sure the cheese matures properly in their air-conditioned, humidified vault. This mechanism ensures that in the two years it takes the cheese to mature, credit keeps flowing. In these tough economic times, this allows producers to feed their cattle, pay their staff....and just keep producing. If for whatever reason, the cheese producer defaults on the loan, the bank has the cheese to sell on. Read more: Model trains and planes motor their way back home . It's no surprise then, Credem treats each wheel like gold. They clean it, turn it, hammer it, prick it and from time to time even taste certain batches. Cristian Bertolini, an expert taster with the Parmigiano Reggiano consortium, tells me each batch has to meet strict criteria. If it doesn't, the cheese is downgraded, the Parmigiano Reggiano imprint scraped off and then it's sold simply as Italian cheese.

For the Caretti family, who have been producing cheese since 1925, the loan is hard currency which has enabled them to keep doing what they love. Right now, they have their own vault on site, financed by the bank. From time to time, they still use the bigger Credem vault. It's a strategy that has paid off. Every day, they make thirty two wheels of Parmigiano Reggiano, adding up to almost twelve-thousand wheels a year. Read more: American apple pie warms struggling Spain . Davide Caretti, who has taken over the business from his father, candidly tells me that this is his life; that he intends to do this forever. Not even the early hours, the arduous work and the 40 kilo wheels can kill his dream. "It is not hard work. It's a strong passion for me and for us," he said. It's a passion as strong as the cheese itself, backed by a bank that takes a mature attitude to lending.

chatgpt: In an unusual move, an Italian bank is using cheese as collateral for loans. The bank reportedly keeps the cheese in large vaults, where it is cleaned, turned, and at times, even taste-tested. According to reports, the bank charges between 3% to 5% interest on the loans, depending on the quality of the cheese. The trend started several years ago when the bank began accepting Parmigiano-Reggiano, a hard, granular cheese with a sharp flavor, as collateral for loans. Since then, the practice has expanded to include other types of cheese, such as Gorgonzola and Grana Padano. The bank reportedly loans up to 80% of the value of the cheese, which can be used by farmers and cheese makers to fund their operations. While the idea of a bank accepting cheese as collateral may seem strange, it is actually a common practice in Italy. Many farmers and cheese makers have been using their cheese as collateral for years, as it allows them to obtain funds to support their businesses without having to sell their products. The bank has taken great care to ensure the quality of the cheese used as collateral. The cheese is kept in controlled conditions and is regularly checked for any signs of spoilage or deterioration. In addition, the bank employs staff to care for the cheese, including cleaning and turning it to ensure that it remains in prime condition. Some borrowers are also required to provide samples of their cheese for taste testing. This is to ensure that the cheese is of high quality and will retain its value over time. The use of cheese as collateral has been criticized by some, who argue that it is an outdated practice that can be risky for borrowers. However, supporters of the practice argue that it is a vital tool for farmers and cheese makers, who often struggle to obtain loans from traditional banks. In recent years, the use of cheese as collateral has become increasingly popular in Italy, with a number of banks offering similar services. While it is unlikely to become a mainstream practice in other countries, it is an example of the unique financial practices that can be found in different parts of the world. In conclusion, while the idea of a bank accepting cheese as collateral may seem odd to many, it is a common practice in Italy. The bank takes great care to ensure the quality of the cheese, and borrowers can obtain loans to support their businesses without having to sell their products. While the practice may not be suitable for every industry, it is an example of the creative solutions that can be found in the world of finance.
