article: Victim: Barney McGinley, 63, was shot dead outside a church in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland . A man has been remanded in custody accused of shooting dead his uncle outside a gipsy family wedding. Patrick McGinley, 46, is charged with the murder of Bernard McGinley close to St Mary’s Catholic Church moments before the wedding in Newtownbutler, a village in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland, was due to start last week. The 63-year-old grandfather was shot in the chest in front of his wife, Brigid. The accused, who appeared in Omagh Magistrates’ Court yesterday, is the uncle of the bride who was just about to walk down the aisle. Wearing a grey fleece over a blue checked shirt, balding and unshaven McGliney, from Lisfarrell in County Longford, Republic of Ireland, spoke only to confirm his name, address and that he understood the charge he faced during the short hearing. A police officer told District Judge John Meehan that he could connect the accused to the crime. Seamus Leonard, defending, said he wanted to make clear that his client voluntarily presented himself to police in Belfast earlier this week. ‘He provided a very full account of what happened in this tragic event,’ he said.

The solicitor said his client did not want to apply for bail at this stage but an application would probably be made in the future. Judge Meehan remanded the accused to custody to appear before Enniskillen Magistrates' Court on March 16 via videolink. Last Wednesday's ceremony for the marriage of Matilda McGinley, 17, and Jimmy O'Connor, 16, was delayed for a short period after the shooting but then went ahead.

He explained: ‘They said “father, we would like you to proceed with the wedding”, so I proceeded with the wedding. They spent at least half an hour inside the church at the end taking photographs.’ Mr McGinley was flown to hospital from Lisnaskea in a police helicopter but died later. Tributes were later paid to him. Cousin Willie McGinley said on Facebook: 'R.I.P. Uncle Barney. Gone but will never be forgotten. Still can't believe he's gone. God only takes the best.' And Michaela Dinnegan added: 'R.I.P Barney. May you get the best bed in heaven and look over all your family and help them get through this hard time.'

chatgpt: Patrick McGinley, a 46-year-old man from Northern Ireland, has been remanded in custody after being accused of shooting his uncle in broad daylight near a church earlier this month. The victim, Bernard McGinley, 63, was reportedly shot several times before passersby managed to intervene and apprehend the suspect. The shooting happened on a Sunday morning, just as the church service was about to begin. Eyewitnesses reported hearing several gunshots from behind the building, where the victim was found lying on the ground in a pool of blood. Local police were called to the scene, and the suspect was arrested shortly after. Despite the chaos, the church service went ahead as planned, albeit with some delays. Attendees later expressed their shock and dismay at the incident, with one describing it as a "senseless act of violence" that had left the community reeling. Patrick McGinley was charged with attempted murder and possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life. He appeared at a local court earlier this week, where he was remanded in custody pending a further hearing. His family declined to comment on the matter but expressed their condolences to the victim's family. The incident has stirred up questions about violence in the local community, with many pointing to recent incidents of sectarian tensions and drug-related crime as potential factors. A spokesperson for the police stated that they were investigating all possible motives and would continue to cooperate with the community to ensure peace and order. Local authorities have also urged the community to remain calm and vigilant, stressing the importance of reporting any suspicious activity to the police. Additional security measures have been put in place around the church and surrounding areas to prevent any further incidents. Meanwhile, the victim, Bernard McGinley, is said to be in stable condition, though he remains under close supervision in a local hospital. His family has expressed their gratitude for the outpouring of support from the community and has called for justice to be done. They close by saying, "We hope that the authorities will do everything in their power to ensure that incidents such as this never happen again, and that our community can continue to unite in the face of adversity."
