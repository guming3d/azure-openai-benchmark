article: (CNN)  -- World champion Valentino Rossi capped his remarkable return to the MotoGP circuit by taking fourth place behind Dani Pedrosa in his first race since breaking his leg six weeks ago. Spaniard Pedrosa on a Honda came in clear of Rossi's Yamaha teammate Jorge Lorenzo in the German round of the championship at Sachsenring. Former world champion Casey Stoner pipped Rossi for the final place on the podium in a thrilling finish. Australian Stoner on a Ducati only came past the nine-time world champion on the last corner to deny the 98,000 spectators the sight of Rossi collecting the third place trophy on crutches. The Italian ace shrugged off his physical impediment and said he was racing for his own satisfaction. "It was easier with a broken leg, and very comfortable from a psychological perspective, because I was there to enjoy myself as I'm no longer in contention for the championship," he told the official MotoGP website. Earlier, the race was stopped by a three-bike crash which left French rider Randy de Puniet with a double leg fracture. The restart saw a shortened 21-lap race which gave Pedrosa the chance to register his second win of the season and cut Lorenzo's lead in the title race. "When they stopped I wasn't sure about the restart. When you stop and restart it's never the same thing, but for me it was good," he said. Lorenzo had to settle for the runner-up spot, conceding that his compatriot was faster on the day. "Pedrosa got more pace than me, it was impossible to follow him. He's done a splendid race, so I'm happy with second place, it's very positive for the championship." But much of the focus was on Rossi, who suffered a broken tibia in a crash at Mugello 42 days ago, and was expected to be ruled out for the rest of the season. He has missed four rounds to effectively derail his hopes of defending his crown, but his battle with old rival Stoner kept the massive crowd enthralled. "I did the best I could this afternoon. I thought Valentino was going to get me but I dragged everything I could out of my bike to get past him," admitted Stoner. Lorenzo leads the standings with 185 points, 47 points ahead Pedrosa with Rossi in sixth place on 74.

chatgpt: Valentino Rossi, who broke his leg just six weeks ago, took an impressive fourth place in the German MotoGP on Sunday. The Italian legend defied the odds to make a strong return to the track and once again show his renowned skill and resilience. The race was won by Spaniard Dani Pedrosa, who rode a near-perfect race. Pedrosa quickly took the lead and never looked back, leaving title leader and compatriot Jorge Lorenzo in second place. Australia's Casey Stoner managed to pip Rossi for third place in the fiercely contested race, but the veteran rider will still be pleased with his performance after such a short recovery period. The nine-time world champion made a determined effort to keep up with the leading pack for much of the race, but ultimately fell just short of a podium finish. Speaking after the race, Rossi was keen to talk about his remarkable recovery. "I'm so happy, because I wasn't sure I'd even be able to race just a few weeks ago," he said. "But the medical team did an amazing job and I was able to get back on my bike and compete with the best in the world. It's a great feeling." Rossi also had praise for the race winner. "Dani was just too strong today," he acknowledged. "He rode a fantastic race, and I simply couldn't keep up with him. But I'm proud of my performance, and I think it's a great sign for the rest of the season." The German MotoGP marked the halfway point of the 2021 season, and Pedrosa's win has seen him move up to seventh in the standings. However, the real battle for the championship remains between Lorenzo and his rival Marc Marquez, who finished fourth in the race. The two are currently separated by just a handful of points, and the second half of the season promises to be a thrilling contest between the two Spanish riders. For Rossi, the result in Germany is further proof of his enduring talent and determination. Despite his injury setback, he has shown that he still has what it takes to compete at the highest level of the sport, and fans around the world will be eagerly anticipating his performances in the remainder of the season.
