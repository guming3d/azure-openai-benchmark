chatgpt: A man has been arrested after he allegedly broke into a sex store in Brisbane and threw sex toys at the female manager. The 34-year-old suspect forced his way through the store's ceiling, setting off an alarm. When confronted by the manager, he allegedly threw a number of sex toys at her before attempting to flee the scene by climbing back through the ceiling. However, police apprehended him on the roof of the building.  The incident occurred in the early hours of the morning at a sex store in Brisbane's CBD. Police were alerted to the scene by the store's alarm system and arrived to find the suspect on the roof. During the course of the investigation, police also found the man in possession of dangerous drugs. The suspect, who has been identified as a resident of Murrumba Downs, has been charged with break and enter as well as possessing dangerous drugs. He is expected to appear in court in the coming weeks to face these charges. The incident has raised concerns about security measures at sex stores and other adult businesses in the area. While many of these establishments do have security systems in place, they are often seen as targets by criminals looking to steal cash, goods or other valuables.  The female manager of the store has expressed shock and anger at the incident, stating that she never expected something like this to happen in her shop. She praised the police for their quick response and urged other business owners in the area to take steps to improve their security systems and prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. As the investigation continues, police are reminding the public to report any suspicious activity or individuals seen in the area. They also encourage business owners to take precautions such as installing security cameras and alarms to deter criminals and protect their properties from theft and damage.
