Dreyer has previously made direct crossings of each of the five Great Lakes. The keen swimmer is raising money and awareness for Habitat for Humanity and he's doing it without a support boat. But one of the dinghies is equipped with a radar target so Dreyer will show up on radar screens of passing freighters. His GPS tracking device will post his position online and he can communicate with it too - sending out per-programmed messages to let crew know he's OK or if he needs help.

He waded out into the water on Monday morning off the Clinton River Boat Club in Clay Township. Dreyer took off in a wetsuit and said 'Next stop, Detroit', as onlookers gathered to watch. During a previous crossing in Lake Superior, Dreyer overcame high waves, falling ill and vomiting, and even lost 20lbs while crossing Lake Huron. But for his latest mission, he's been training since October and was pleased that current water temperatures are between 68 and 71 degrees farenheit.

chatgpt: Jim Dreyer, a 49-year-old endurance swimmer, is gearing up to swim for 30 hours across a lake to raise funds for a Habitat for Humanity project. This isn't the first time Dreyer attempted an extraordinary feat – he has previously made a direct crossing of each of the five Great Lakes.  The swim is set to take place in August, and Dreyer is hoping to raise $50,000 for a Habitat for Humanity project, which will provide affordable and decent housing for families in need. Speaking to sources, Dreyer said his decision to undertake the task was inspired by the work of Habitat for Humanity and the families they helped in providing housing. "My heart aches for those people who need shelter," Dreyer said. "Swimming for 30 hours may be a challenge, but it pales in comparison to what some families have to go through on a daily basis." Dreyer's previous accomplishments include swimming from Michigan’s Mackinac Island to Michigan's St. Ignace, a distance of roughly 15 miles, against the strong currents of the Straits of Mackinac. He also completed a 120-mile swim in 2013, from Chicago to Michigan City, Indiana.  The swim is set to take place in one of the Great Lakes in the United States, with specifics yet to be announced. However, Dreyer has already been working on his preparations, with training sessions including endurance swimming in cold-water temperatures. Swimming for a good cause is not new to Dreyer, who believes charitable work and endurance swimming go hand in hand. In 2011, he swam the length of the Grand Traverse Bay, covering a distance of 48 miles, to raise money for the We Care Foundation, an organization that helps combat substance abuse.  Dreyer's commitment to raising funds for good causes has not gone unnoticed. The World Open Water Swimming Association named him as the "man of the year" in 2013 for his various charity swims. He was also featured in the Guinness Book of World Records for his 120-mile swim in 2013.  Dreyer's upcoming swim highlights the power of individuals to make a positive change in their communities by raising funds for causes they care about. From his endurance swims, to his commitment to raising money for charities, Dreyer serves as an inspiration for those looking to make a difference in the world.  Dreyer's 30-hour swim will certainly test his endurance and strength, but with his history of successful extreme swims, there's no doubt he'll be able to accomplish his goal of raising money for Habitat for Humanity. The whole world watches as Jim Dreyer attempts his next feat to raise funds for a good cause.
