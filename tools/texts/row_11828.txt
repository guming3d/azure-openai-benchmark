article: A Scandinavian men's underwear brand named Comfyballs simply will not fly in America, says the U.S. Patent and Trade Office. The agency has denied the Norwegian company's application to register the trademark in the U.S., calling the name 'vulgar.' The company was born in 2013 and quickly moved to the UK, New Zealand and Australia where it promises its underwear--designed with PackageFront technology--reduces heat while allowing for freer movement. Scroll down for video . Vulgar? A Norwegian brand of men's underwear called Comfyballs was denied a U.S. trademark for its name when the U.S. patent office called it 'vulgar' According to the agency's response to the application, the trademark could have gone through had it been slightly funnier. 'The mark does not create a double entendre or other idiomatic expression,' they wrote. 'When used in this way, the word, ‘balls’ has an offensive meaning.' As the Telegraph notes, another trademark--this one from an American company--had previously been denied by the agency for a similar reason. Undaunted: The company's founder says he'll petition for a review of the decision and cites other similar trademarks such as 'Nice Balls' and I Love My Balls' that have been allowed through the process . Ben & Jerry's ice cream flavor Schweddy Balls--so named after a well-known Saturday Night Live sketch--saw only a short-lived release in 2011 after the agency blocked a trademark for its name. On the Comfyballs website, a typical pair of the garments costs 298.00 krone. While the site does not appear to ship Comfyballs stateside just yet, that's around 40 U.S. dollars. The company's undaunted founder Anders Selvig has asked for a review of the patent office's decision and notes similar trademarks that have been allowed through the process. '"Nice Balls" and "I love my balls" have recently both been approved by the USPTO,' he said. 'Luckily, Europeans have a softer view on what is deemed to be vulgar and the EU allowed Comfyballs to trademark without hassle earlier this year.' Should have been funnier: The USPTO said the trademark also 'does not create a double entendre or other idiomatic expression'
highlights: The  brand has spread to Australia, New Zealand and the UK but America isn't having it . The agency says the name refers solely to a man's testicles and 'does not create a double entendre' -- and is therefor vulgar . Ben & Jerry's Schweddy Balls brand ice cream was also blocked by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office .

chatgpt: The popular brand, Ben & Jerry's, has been making headlines once again, this time for their Schweddy Balls ice cream flavor. However, the brand has been met with opposition in the United States. According to reports, the Schweddy Balls flavor has been successful in Australia, New Zealand, and the UK, but has faced resistance in America. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has blocked the brand from being sold in the country. The agency claims that the name, Schweddy Balls, refers solely to a man's testicles and "does not create a double entendre". Therefore, they believe it is a vulgar name and should not be trademarked. This is not the first time that Ben & Jerry's has faced opposition for their flavors. In 2011, the brand released the Schweddy Balls flavor as part of their lineup. The flavor was inspired by a Saturday Night Live skit and featured vanilla ice cream with fudge-covered rum and malt balls. At the time, the flavor was met with both praise and criticism. Some consumers found the name and concept humorous, while others found it offensive. Despite the mixed response, the brand continued to sell the flavor until it was eventually phased out. However, the Schweddy Balls name lived on as a symbol of the brand's irreverent and quirky marketing style. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's decision to block the Schweddy Balls brand is likely to further fuel the debate about the appropriateness of the name. For now, it seems that American consumers will have to look elsewhere for their Ben & Jerry's ice cream fix.
