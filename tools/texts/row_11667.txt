Break-in: Leanne Zaloumis, 30, pictured leaving Isleworth Crown Court, avoided jail despite forcing herself into Simon Cowell's home . A stalker who broke into the home of music mogul Simon Cowell and hid on a shelf in his giant wardrobe holding a brick avoided jail today. Leanne Zaloumis was given a 12-month community order as well as a restraining order today after getting into his mansion while the X-Factor creator watched TV in his bedroom four months ago. Judge Robert Winstanley at Isleworth Crown Court, west London, also said that the order would have a mental health care requirement. Zaloumis, of Catford, south-east London, had admitted being in possession of a brick with the intent to damage or destroy property, and breaking a window at the Holland Park address. Cowell, 52, was watching TV in his bedroom when he heard a 'loud bang' coming from his bathroom on March 24 and called his staff. Zaloumis was taken to Notting Hill police station after being found inside the property. At a previous hearing, she was told she must stay at her home address, remain inside between 7pm and 7am and wear an electronic tag. She was also told by Judge John Dennis on that occasion that the 102 days she spent in custody was 'sufficient punishment'. Cowell who was not present at today’s hearing, saw that Zaloumis was standing outside his shattered bathroom window, screaming as she held a brick above her head, her hands covered in blood.

Scotland Yard was called, who sent a squad of armed officers to rescue him as Zaloumis continued to shout, repeatedly slamming the glass with the brick. After a lengthy search of the grounds, police found the intruder hiding on a shelf 7ft up in a walk-in wardrobe next to the star’s bedroom, where the walls had been smeared with blood. Police drew their weapons and asked her to get down, but Zaloumis struggled with officers, screaming: ‘Listen to me, someone is trapped in here.’ The defendant told police: ‘Simon knows me. I didn’t break in, I was already in the house.’ She claimed the star had stalked her via Twitter. She also admitted researching his address on her computer and making a previous visit to his home six months earlier when she believed he was away in America, even though her family has claimed that she isn’t a fan.

chatgpt: Leanne Zaloumis, a woman with a history of mental health issues, was found screaming and smashing the bathroom window of music mogul Simon Cowell's London home. The incident took place in March 2012 and resulted in Zaloumis being arrested on suspicion of breaking and entering. However, the woman claimed that Cowell knew her and that she had entered the home with his permission. Armed police were called to the scene, and Zaloumis was apprehended without any resistance. She was charged with aggravated burglary and criminal damage and appeared in court the following day. During the hearing, Zaloumis claimed that she had a "telepathic connection" with Cowell and that he had invited her into his home. However, these claims were not substantiated, and Cowell denied any knowledge of Zaloumis. The court was told that Zaloumis had a history of mental health issues and had been hospitalized several times in the past. She had previously attempted to contact Cowell and even his mother, but her attempts had been unsuccessful. Despite her claims, Zaloumis pleaded guilty to both charges against her. She received a 12-month community order and a restraining order preventing her from contacting Cowell or coming within 300 meters of his home. Speaking after the hearing, a spokesperson for Cowell said, "We have a security team that works closely with the police every day to ensure the safety of Simon and his family. This was a frightening experience, and we are grateful it has been resolved." The incident serves as a reminder of the potential dangers faced by high-profile individuals such as Cowell. Despite having a security team in place, the music mogul was still targeted by a unstable individual with a history of mental health problems. Zaloumis was given the opportunity to receive mental health treatment as part of her community order, and it is hoped that she will receive the help she needs to overcome her issues. The incident also highlights the importance of vigilance and prompt action when it comes to mental health problems. In cases like this, it is important to seek professional help as soon as possible to prevent potentially dangerous situations from occurring. As for Cowell, he has since increased security measures at his home to ensure the safety of himself and his family. The incident serves as a reminder that no one is immune to the potential dangers that arise from mental health issues and that it is important to take prompt action when concerns arise.
