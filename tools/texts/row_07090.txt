chatgpt: Last year was a record-breaking year for both Heathrow and Gatwick Airports, as they boasted an impressive number of passengers. Heathrow, in particular, has made strides towards becoming the world's third-busiest airport, cementing its position as one of the premier travel hubs in the world. With both airports hoping to secure a new runway, the future looks brighter than ever for the entire London travel industry. Heathrow, in particular, was the standout performer last year, as they welcomed a staggering 73.4 million passengers. This number represents an increase of over 1.4 million passengers from the previous year, making it the busiest year in the airport's history. This growth is due in no small part to Heathrow's commitment to investing in its infrastructure and services. The airport's CEO, John Holland-Kaye, comments on the success: "Last year was an incredible year for Heathrow Airport, and we are thrilled with the results. Our brand is stronger than ever, and we are looking forward to continuing this growth in the years to come." Gatwick Airport also had a successful year, as it welcomed a record-breaking 38.1 million passengers, an increase of 7.7% over the previous year. This growth is largely attributed to the airport's increased focus on improving passenger experience, including the introduction of new technologies and faster security lines. Thurrock MP Jackie Doyle-Price commented: "This is fantastic news for Gatwick Airport, and a testament to the hard work of all those involved in the airport's growth." Both Heathrow and Gatwick Airports have been competing to secure a new runway, which would significantly enhance their capacities and thus, the travel industry as a whole. Heathrow's proposal for a third runway would add an additional 250,000 flights a year, and provide £142 billion worth of economic benefits to the UK. Gatwick's proposal, on the other hand, would provide up to £20 billion in economic benefits and focus on increased regional connectivity. With the UK government expected to make a decision on the matter later this year, the stakes are high for both airports. Holland-Kaye noted that "this decision will shape the future of airport expansion in the UK, and we hope that the government will make the right choice for the British people and the economy as a whole." In conclusion, it was a landmark year for both Heathrow and Gatwick Airports, as they both set records for the number of passengers they welcomed. With both airports vying for a new runway, the future looks bright for the London travel industry. The UK government's decision on the matter later this year will undoubtedly have a significant impact on the future of airport expansion in the UK.
