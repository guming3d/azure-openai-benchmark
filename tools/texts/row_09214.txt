A Colorado man who was jailed for life for killing a teenager almost two decades ago will walk free after being cleared by fresh DNA evidence. Robert 'Rider' Dewey was 33 when he went to prison for the 1994 rape and murder of 19-year-old Jacie Taylor. The 51-year-old was freed yesterday, after new testing of DNA evidence pointed to someone else as the suspect. At a court hearing yesterday, a judge dismissed charges against Dewey and declared him a free man. Dewey flashed a small smile through his trim beard. He told reporters he just wants to kick back, ride his motorcycle and spend time with his family. 'Contrary to popular belief, the world doesn't stop when you go to prison,' said Dewey, wearing glasses and with his hair in two long braids. 'There's a lot for me to catch up on.' Dewey was sentenced in 1996 to life in prison without parole after he was convicted of killing Taylor, who was found dead in her bathtub in Palisade on 4 June, 1994. DNA technology at the time gave jurors conflicting information to consider, according to news accounts at the time. At his sentencing hearing, Dewey had said there was still a killer out there. The Colorado Attorney General's Office's Justice Review Project, which reviews cases where post-conviction DNA testing could clear a person, took up Dewey's case last year. The advanced DNA tests that cleared Dewey have led to an arrest warrant being issued for Douglas Thames, who is accused of first-degree murder and first-degree sexual assault. Thames had lived near Taylor, and his DNA profile is linked to evidence found in Taylor's apartment. Thames told investigators in a prison interview that he didn't know Taylor but that his girlfriend at the time had gone to classes with Taylor at Palisade High School. Thames is already serving a life sentence for a 1989 murder in Fort Collins. On Monday, Dewey thanked his legal team and said DNA evidence should be reviewed in more old cases, noting inmates around the country have been freed by new testing. 'Who else is out there?' Dewey said. Dewey said he tried to stay positive while behind bars. 'It threw me into a dark tunnel,' he said of his conviction. His first two years in prison, he didn't make his bed. Now, he is trying to understand why people text each other on their phones instead of just talking and where he might find work as he starts over. 'There's going to be trials and tribulations out here too,' Dewey said. Dewey added he wants to ride his motorcycle but has no specific plans for where. 'As long as it's in the wind, I'm happy,' he said.

chatgpt: After spending 16 years in prison for a crime he says he didn't commit, Robert Dewey has finally been exonerated. In 1996, Dewey was sentenced to life in prison without parole for the sexual assault and murder of 19-year-old Jacie Taylor, who was found dead in her bathtub in June 1994. Dewey's conviction was based on circumstantial evidence and witness testimony, as there was no physical evidence linking him to the crime. Despite maintaining his innocence throughout his trial and subsequent appeals, Dewey was unable to convince the courts of his innocence. However, new DNA testing conducted on evidence obtained from the crime scene led to the arrest of Douglas Thames in 2012. Thames had previously been a suspect in the case but was cleared due to lack of evidence. The new DNA testing, which was not available at the time of Dewey's trial, confirmed Thames' involvement in the crime. Thames pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was sentenced to 40 years in prison. Following Thames' arrest and confession, a judge overturned Dewey's conviction and ordered his release in 2012. Dewey's case is a stark reminder of the importance of DNA testing in criminal investigations. Without this technology, Dewey may have spent the rest of his life in prison for a crime he didn't commit. Dewey's exoneration has also raised questions about the reliability of witness testimony in criminal cases. Many witnesses in Dewey's trial had questionable motives and may have been coerced into giving false testimony. Dewey's case highlights the need for a more thorough and unbiased approach to witnesses in criminal investigations. Although Dewey has been exonerated, his life has been irreparably changed by his wrongful conviction. He spent over a decade in prison, away from his family and unable to provide for himself. Dewey's case is a reminder that the criminal justice system is imperfect, and innocent people can be wrongly convicted. In conclusion, the recent exoneration of Robert Dewey serves as a cautionary tale for the importance of DNA testing and the flaws in the criminal justice system. Dewey's story reminds us that there is always more work to do when it comes to ensuring justice in our society.
