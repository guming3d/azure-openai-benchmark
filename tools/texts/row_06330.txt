article: Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Samsung Electronics' tablet computer, the Galaxy Tab, will be available to consumers in Australia in the coming days, after the South Korean electronics giant scored a victory against Apple in a legal battle that had blocked the product from going on sale. The Australian High Court denied Apple's appeal to an earlier court ruling that overturned an injunction placed on Samsung's Galaxy Tab 10.1 citing violation of its patent. The recent ruling is expected to give Samsung a stronger footing in a legal battle it is involved in with Apple in several countries across the world, including the United States. Samsung welcomed the court's decision and said the Galaxy Tab 10.1 will be ready for sale in Australia in time for the Christmas shopping season. "The Full Court of Australia decision on November 30 clearly affirmed our view that Apple's claims lack merit and that an injunction should not have been imposed on the Galaxy Tab 10.1," Samsung said in a news release, referring to the earlier ruling that lifted the injunction. Apple claims that Samsung's newer Galaxy Tab 10.1 copies the iPad's look and infringes upon its design patents. "It's no coincidence that Samsung's latest products look a lot like the iPhone and iPad, from the shape of the hardware to the user interface and even the packaging. This kind of blatant copying is wrong and, as we've said many times before, we need to protect Apple's intellectual property when companies steal our ideas," according to a statement from Apple. Apple recently was denied a preliminary injunction on several of Samsung's mobile phones and tablets in America by a San Jose court. The South Korean electronics giant said it is confident that it can prove the distinctiveness of its mobile products when the two companies battle it out in court next year. Samsung separately filed a complaint back in June with the United States International Trade Commission claiming Apple has violated five patents related to wireless communications standards and mobile device user interface. The South Korean company requested a permanent exclusion order that would block the entry of all Apple products in question, including the iPad and iPhone series, into the United States.

chatgpt: The Australian High Court rejected Apple's appeal against an earlier court decision that allowed Samsung to sell its latest Galaxy Tab in the country. The ruling came after a costly legal battle between the two tech giants over Samsung's latest tablet, which Apple claims copies the iPad. Samsung welcomed the High Court ruling and announced that the Galaxy Tab 10.1 will be available for sale in Australia in time for Christmas. The company's lawyers argued that the latest version of the tablet did not infringe Apple's patents, and the High Court agreed. Apple had first sued Samsung in April 2011, claiming that the Galaxy Tab and other Samsung smartphones and tablets were "slavish" copies of its popular iPhone and iPad products. The legal dispute has since escalated into a global patent war between the two rivals, with lawsuits being filed in several countries. In November 2011, an Australian court granted an injunction preventing Samsung from selling the Galaxy Tab 10.1 in the country, citing concerns that it would infringe on Apple's patents. However, Samsung appealed the decision and was later granted a stay, allowing the tablet to be released in Australia until the High Court appeal was heard. In its latest ruling, the High Court found that the lower court's decision had been flawed and had misunderstood the nature of Apple's patents, which related to the design and functionality of the tablet. The court said that there was no reason to stop Samsung from selling the Galaxy Tab 10.1 in Australia. The ruling provides a significant victory for Samsung in its ongoing legal battle with Apple, which has also filed similar lawsuits against the company in the United States and several other countries. However, the legal battle is far from over, with both companies continuing to pursue lawsuits against each other in various jurisdictions around the world. Apple and Samsung are both major players in the global smartphone and tablet markets, and their ongoing legal dispute has implications for the wider technology industry. The outcome of these cases could determine the level of innovation and competition in the industry in the years to come. In conclusion, the Australian High Court's decision to deny Apple's appeal against the earlier court decision allowing Samsung to sell the Galaxy Tab 10.1 in Australia is a significant victory for the Korean tech giant, which can now release its latest tablet in the country just in time for Christmas. The legal battle between the two rivals is far from over, with lawsuits continuing to be filed in several countries, and the outcome of these cases could have far-reaching implications for the technology industry as a whole.
