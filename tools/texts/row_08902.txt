article: Passengers who were aboard Asiana Airlines Flight 214, which crashed in San Francisco, began legal action against Boeing Co., which made the plane, according to a law firm representing passengers. Boeing, which is headquartered in Chicago, declined comment. Spokeswoman Debbie Heathers referred all calls to the National Transportation Safety Board. Ribbeck Law Chartered, a Chicago-based law firm, said Tuesday that it had filed the initial court petition on behalf of more than 80 passengers. The firm said Asiana Airlines will be added as a defendant in the next few days. Legal action will also be taken against several unidentified "component part manufacturers who may be responsible for this disaster," the firm said in a statement. Asiana spokesman Ki Won Suh declined to comment on the law firm's plans against the airline. The Asiana 777 fell short of its approach and crashed on the runway at San Francisco airport on July 6. Three people were killed and more than 180 others hurt. Seconds before crash, passengers knew they were too low . The NTSB is investigating. The early stage of the investigation has focused heavily on actions of the crew during the landing attempt. The law firm filed a petition for discovery in Cook County Circuit Court in Illinois, and the petition "demands that the court orders the defendants to immediately release to the victims of the crash all relevant evidence concerning design and manufacturing records of the accident aircraft as well as any records concerning its maintenance," the law firm said in a statement. The 83 passengers represented by the firm include some who have serious back injuries, broken legs and brain trauma, said attorney Monica R. Kelly. During the crash, sliding ramps deployed inside the plane, blocking passengers' access to the exit door and trapping them inside the burning plane, the law firm alleged. Also, passengers were injured when seats collapsed during the crash-landing, Kelly said. The law firm also cites reports that the crash could have been caused by "a mechanical malfunction of the auto-throttle," according to the firm's statement.

chatgpt: Dozens of passengers are taking legal action against the plane maker of Asiana Airlines Flight 214, which crashed in San Francisco on July 6, killing three people. The National Transportation Safety Board is currently conducting an investigation into the details of the crash which focuses on the actions of the crew during the landing attempt. The group of passengers, represented by a team of attorneys, is seeking compensation from Boeing, the maker of the Boeing 777 aircraft used in the flight. The passengers allege that the plane was designed with a faulty auto throttle system, which allegedly caused the crash. The NTSB has been conducting an exhaustive investigation of the crash, which involved interviewing members of the flight crew and reviewing data from the plane's flight recorders. According to an NTSB spokesperson, "early attention has focused on the actions of the crew during the landing attempt."  The flight was carrying 307 people, including crew members, when it crashed onto the runway at San Francisco International Airport. The impact of the crash caused the plane to break apart, resulting in serious injuries to many passengers and the deaths of three others. This is not the first time Boeing has been sued over the design of its planes. In 2019, the company reached a settlement for $100 million with the families of victims of the Lion Air crash, which killed all 189 passengers and crew on board. It should be noted that the investigation into the Asiana Airlines Flight 214 crash is ongoing, and no definitive cause has been determined. Boeing has provided support to the NTSB as its investigation continues. The plaintiffs in this case are seeking monetary damages for the harm they suffered as a result of the crash, including medical bills, lost wages, and other losses. The case could take years to resolve and could involve a number of legal and technical challenges. In the meantime, investigators continue to piece together the details of the crash and the actions of the crew. The NTSB has said that it is committed to finding the cause of the accident and working to prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future.
