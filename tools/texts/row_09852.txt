article: A council has said it will cancel a . village hall’s rate subsidy if it hosts a speech by British National . Party leader Nick Griffin. Mr Griffin is due to give a talk  at Baldslow Memorial Hall in  St Leonards, East Sussex, today. But Hastings Borough Council has told . those who run the hall they will have to repay the £376 they received . as a charity in rate relief if the speech goes ahead. Controversial: Nick Griffin's planned speech in St Leonards is at the centre of a storm between a village hall and its local council . However the council has been accused of trying to 'blackmail' the village hall. Hastings Borough Council leader Jeremy Birch said the local authority was 'committed to equality of opportunity and to community harmony. He added: 'We have no intention of providing financial subsidy to those who aim to undermine these principles.' BNP party spokesman Simon Darby said: 'It's quite beyond belief what they are trying to do. Payback: The people who run Baldslow Village Hall (pictured) have been told if they do not  withdraw the event they will have to repay a rate subsidy . 'They're basically seeking to tax people . who don't agree with the Labour Party, which is not really the British . way to do things. 'It's effectively blackmail, putting a gun to the people that run the hall by giving them a financial penalty if Nick is allowed to speak there. He's an MEP, he's not some person off the street.' 'Beyond belief': Simon Darby accused the council of trying to blackmail the village hall . Councillor Birch said he had been approached by members of the community who were unhappy at Mr Griffin's appearance. He went on: 'We have discretion about providing an element of business rate relief to charities. 'Here we have a charity that is providing a platform within its community building to the national leader of a political party committed to challenging these principles. 'If the charity wants to run a community facility for genuine community groups like Cubs, Scouts etc then it can withdraw the booking from the BNP and the council will reconsider the business rates.' Earlier this month Trinity College Dublin was forced into a U-turn on plans to have Mr Griffin join a debate on immigration. The university said it could not guarantee the safety and wellbeing of staff and students and warned the party leader he would not be allowed on its campus.

chatgpt: Organizers of an event planned to be held at a village hall in Meirionnydd have been told that they must repay a rate subsidy if the speech by the British National Party leader, Nick Griffin, goes ahead at the venue. This announcement has sparked outrage among supporters of the party, who have accused the authorities of attempting to "blackmail" the organizers of the event. The Meirionnydd authorities believe that the speech by Nick Griffin could undermine community harmony and lead to an increase in tension between different groups. They have therefore informed the organizers of the event that they must withdraw the invitation to Nick Griffin or face the consequences. The decision has not gone down well with the organizers of the event, who claim that they have the right to hold the event and invite whoever they wish to address the gathering. They have also accused the authorities of interfering with their rights to freedom of speech and assembly. However, the council has defended its decision, arguing that it has a responsibility to uphold community cohesion and ensure that everyone feels safe and welcome in the area. They have emphasized that their decision is not based on political bias but rather on the potential impact the event could have on the local community. The village hall where the event is planned to take place is situated in a rural area of Meirionnydd, and it was originally built with the help of a rate subsidy from the council. The subsidy was intended to support the development of local community infrastructure and services. However, the council is now making it clear that the subsidy will have to be repaid if the event goes ahead as planned. The decision by the council has also prompted a response from local politicians, with some accusing the council of overstepping its boundaries and censoring free speech. The British National Party has also spoken out against the decision, claiming that it is a clear attempt to silence their views and prevent them from organizing events. This latest incident highlights the ongoing tensions that exist between different political groups in the UK, and the challenges faced by local authorities in trying to balance the rights of individuals with the need to maintain community harmony. It remains to be seen whether the organizers of the event will comply with the council's request or challenge it in court.
