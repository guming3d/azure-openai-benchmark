chatgpt: Real Madrid legend Iker Casillas has admitted that he received interest from Arsenal over the summer, but there was never a concrete offer made. Casillas, who has been with Real since 1990, has seen limited action in recent years and made just two La Liga appearances last season as Diego Lopez became the team's first-choice goalkeeper. Despite the lack of playing time, Casillas insists that he wants to stay at Real Madrid and finish his career with the club. "There was a lot of talk about an offer from Arsenal, but there was nothing concrete," says Casillas. "I want to stay at Real Madrid, keep fighting here and finish my career here. But if the club doesn't want me, I'm not closing the door on a move abroad." Despite his desire to remain with Real, Casillas understands that the decision ultimately lies in the hands of the club. "The club knows best what their plans are and what they want. I'm happy when I play and I'm happy when I don't play because I know I'm part of this club's history," says the 36-year-old goalkeeper. Casillas has a storied career with Real Madrid, winning five La Liga titles, three Champions League titles, and numerous other domestic and international trophies. While talk of a move away from the club may be unsettling to some fans, it's clear that Casillas has the club's best interests at heart. "I have a contract until 2019 and I want to fulfil it," says Casillas. "My dream is to end my career at Real Madrid, but if the club wants me to go, I will go. I'm not going to cause any problems, I'm just going to keep working hard and giving my best for the team."  As Casillas remains committed to the club, fans will be hoping to see him remain with the squad for the foreseeable future. Regardless of what happens, the legend of Iker Casillas will always be intertwined with the history of Real Madrid.
