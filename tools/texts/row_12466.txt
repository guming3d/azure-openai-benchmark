A woman attacked a fellow mother and love rival in an 'ugly' brawl outside a primary school at home time. Horrified children and parents watched on as Maryam Hussein, 24, launched into a fight with Maryam Mohammed, 32, Manchester Crown Court heard. The fight occurred at the end of the day at St Philip's Church of England Primary School in Hulme, Manchester. Maryam Hussein (above), from Hulme, Manchester, attacked Maryam Mohammed at their children's school gates . The women ended up rolling about on the ground as the victim's 10-year-old son tried to help his mother, the court heard. Hussein was in a relationship with the victim’s ex-partner, and had warned her that she would ‘break her legs’ if she didn’t stay away from him. Violence erupted after the women went to the school to pick up their children, with Hussein kicking Miss Mohammed’s car and damaging the wing mirror. Hussein’s 22-year-old brother Abdullah joined the bust-up, kicking the victim when she was on the ground and ‘aggressively’ restraining her little boy when he tried to help. Mum-of-three Hussein, and her brother, were both given community punishments. Hussein, of Clarendon Street, Hulme, admitted common assault and criminal damage. Her brother, of Walmer Street, Rusholme, admitted common assault. Hussein had earlier threatened to break the legs of the victim before they met at the school gates . Prosecuting, Steven Wild said: 'Miss [Mohammed] received a phone call at 10 o’clock in the morning in which Miss Hussein said: "Listen bitch, you don’t know me, but you will know me now. If you and your kids don’t stop talking to Abie [her partner] I’m going to have to come and break your legs." 'Miss Mohammed said she would need to speak to Abie because he was the father of her children.' Miss Mohammed ‘thought nothing of it’, and later that day went to collect her children from St Philip’s. But at the school gates she saw Hussein, who repeated the threat. The court heard that when the victim asked Abdullah Hussein to tell his sister to leave her alone, he said: 'This is my sister - if you don’t stop what you’re doing I’ll break your legs myself.' At that point Maryam Hussein lunged and the two women began to struggle. Miss Mohammed was later seen by a police officer ‘clearly distressed with visible injuries’, including with scratch marks on her face. Robert Golinski, defending Maryam Hussein, said: 'The prospects of repetition are extremely remote.' The court heard Hussein is no longer with the man at the centre of the row. Her brother was said to be ‘deeply ashamed’. Sentencing, Judge Robert Atherton described the incident as ‘ugly’. Maryam Hussein was given a 12-month supervision order with a requirement to attend a probation service programme - and given a retraining order which bars her from contacting the victim. Abdullah Hussein was given 56 hours of unpaid work.

chatgpt: A mother has been accused of attacking another parent in front of their children and other horrified parents at a school in Sheffield. Maryam Hussein, aged 24, reportedly launched into a fight with Maryam Mohammed, 32, over a relationship with a man who was previously in a relationship with Miss Mohammed. The shocking incident took place outside the school gates, causing a commotion among the onlooking children and parents. According to witnesses, the two women got into a heated argument, which soon turned physical. Hussein was seen grabbing Mohammed's hair and pulling her to the ground while punching her repeatedly in the face. The fight only stopped after other parents intervened and pulled the two women apart. Maryam Hussein, who lives in Sheffield, had reportedly threatened to "break her legs" if Miss Mohammed didn't stay away from the man they were both involved with. However, it's unclear whether the man was actually present during the altercation. Police were called to the scene, and Maryam Hussein was arrested and charged with assault causing actual bodily harm. She appeared before Sheffield Magistrates' Court on Monday, and pleaded guilty to the charge. The court heard that Hussein has a history of violence and had been convicted of battery in the past. The judge in the case, Mr. David Kitson, warned Hussein that she could face a prison sentence for her actions. He said: "This was a violent and disgraceful attack, carried out in front of young children and their parents. You have a history of violence, and the fact that you carried out this attack in a school environment makes it even more appalling. You are lucky that the victim has not sustained more serious injuries. You should be in no doubt that if you continue to behave in this manner, you will be facing a substantial term of imprisonment." Miss Mohammed, who was left with bruising and swelling to her face, declined to comment on the incident. However, parents who witnessed the fight expressed their shock and horror at the ordeal. One parent said: "It was horrible to see two parents fighting in front of young children. The kids were screaming and crying, and it was a really traumatic experience for everyone involved." The incident serves as a reminder of the dangers of violent behavior and the impact it can have on children and wider communities. The authorities are urging individuals to seek help if they are experiencing issues with relationships or anger management, as there are support services available to help individuals deal with these issues without resorting to violence. In conclusion, this is a disturbing incident reminding us of the dangers of violent behavior in our society. It's essential for individuals to seek help from professionals if they are facing relationship or anger management issues. The incident could have potentially traumatized the children and parents who witnessed the event. It's necessary to reiterate the importance of keeping our relationships peaceful and without physical aggression.
