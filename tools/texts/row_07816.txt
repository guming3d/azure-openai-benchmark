article: MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- A Florida boy remains in stable condition just days after he found his parents' long-forgotten handgun in a closet and accidentally shot himself in the head. Police are deciding whether or not to charge parents after their son found a forgotten gun and shot himself. Sheriff's detectives in Pinellas County, Florida, near St. Petersburg, say the boy found the .25-caliber European semi-automatic handgun in a box in a closet in their home. "They are dealing with this very tragic situation, and at this point, no charges have been filed," said Cecilia Barreda of the Pinellas County sheriff's office. His stepfather found Jacob Larson, 12, with a gunshot wound to the head Friday. The stepfather called 911. Police say the shooting took place between 7:40 a.m., when his mother, Tracy Newman, leaves for work, and about 11 a.m., when his stepfather, Joseph Newton, returns home. The boy normally goes to school about 8:30 a.m. "A few years ago, they moved, and [the gun] was stored in the closet. The mother never checked it, never fired it," Barreda said. "They told detectives that they forgot they had stored it in a box inside a closet. Both her and her husband forgot about it," she said. Newman told detectives that she received the gun six years ago from a former employer. Police say that both she and her husband are cooperating in the investigation into the incident. The sheriff's office says it's unlikely that they will face charges. Florida law prohibits a person from leaving a loaded firearm where a minor might have access to it. Prosecutors do have some discretion, and depending on what happens with the gun, charges ranging from a misdemeanor to a felony can be filed in the event of death or serious injury. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that 17 states have child firearm access protection and safe-storage laws. Chief Assistant State Attorney Bruce Bartlett says that although laws are needed, an accident with a firearm can be a greater penalty than any judge could ever hand down. "Sometimes, the injury of a child is more severe from a punishment standpoint than any kind of criminal charge," he said. The CDC says three children per day, on average, died in accidental incidents in the United States from 2000 to 2005, the last year data are available. Bartlett said his office has filed charges in previous cases when there was culpable negligence on the part of a gun owner. But, he says, there are cases where accidents happen, not crimes. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence says that 34 percent of children in the United States live in homes with at least one firearm, so people have to be aware. "It's a horrible thing, and those parents will blame themselves from here out, and you have to look at things real close to see if it warrants any enforcement from our end," Bartlett said.

chatgpt: A 12-year-old boy was found with a .25-caliber gun in his possession in Florida after he discovered the weapon in a box in his closet. Local law enforcement officials have not yet pressed charges against anyone in relation to the incident. Florida law specifically prohibits loaded firearms from being left in a place where a minor could feasibly obtain it. The prosecutor in the case noted the severity of the incident, stating that "sometimes, the injury of a child is more severe" than any potential punishment that could be levied against the responsible parties. The event serves as a sobering reminder to gun owners to thoroughly secure their firearms in locations where minors cannot access them. With children naturally curious and often oblivious to the potential dangers of a loaded firearm, it's the responsibility of adult owners to ensure that these weapons remain out of reach. According to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, many accidents involving firearms occur when they are being mishandled or improperly stored. In fact, an estimated 40 percent of households with children also possess firearms, and more than two-thirds of all firearms-related incidents with children occur in the home. For this reason, additional precautions, such as installing gun safes, removing ammunition from the area and ensuring that firearms are kept under lock and key, can help prevent tragic accidents like those that occurred in this case. Many advocates for gun safety argue that more legislation is needed to help reduce the frequency of these types of incidents. While they understand the right to bear arms is enshrined in the Constitution, they argue that updated laws that emphasize responsible gun ownership can help save lives, particularly where minors are involved. However, opposition to additional gun control measures remains high, with some gun rights advocates arguing that such laws would infringe on their rights as citizens. This debate is likely to continue for some time, and the onus is on individual gun owners to ensure that they are taking all possible precautions to ensure their firearms are secure. In the case of the 12-year-old boy who was found with the loaded .25-caliber gun, it is not yet clear how the weapon ended up in his possession or who is responsible for leaving it within reach. However, it is clear that the potential consequences of such an oversight are severe, and that gun owners must take great care to ensure that their weapons are properly stored at all times. From gun safes to lockboxes and other preventive measures, there are many ways to ensure that firearms remain secure and out of reach of minors. Gun owners who take their responsibility seriously must take action to protect themselves and their families from the devastating consequences that can occur when firearms fall into the wrong hands.
