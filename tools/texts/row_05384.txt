Bruna Francois was charged with petit theft after a guest complained of missing cash from their safe. Hidden cameras installed by the hotel's security team captured Francois walking over to the safe and leaving with a wad of cash. The incident occurred over the weekend when a guest staying at the hotel reported that $20 was missing from their safe. The hotel management immediately launched an investigation and found the footage of Francois stealing the money. They promptly reported the incident to the local authorities who arrested Francois on Monday. Speaking to journalists, the hotel manager expressed his dismay and shock at Francois' actions. He said, "We take the safety and security of our guests very seriously, and we have zero tolerance for any kind of dishonest behavior. We are cooperating with the police to ensure that justice is served." Francois, who was employed at the hotel for less than a year, has been terminated from her job. Petit theft is considered a misdemeanor in Florida and carries a maximum sentence of one year in jail and a $1,000 fine. Francois has since been released on bond and is awaiting trial. This incident highlights the importance of installing security measures in hotels to prevent theft and other criminal activities. Many hotels have now started using hidden cameras, security personnel, and advanced surveillance systems to ensure the safety and security of their guests. In recent years, hotel room theft has become a growing problem, with criminals often targeting unsuspecting guests. It is therefore essential for hotels to take proactive measures to deter and prevent such criminal activity. The hotel's management has apologized to the affected guest and assured them that they will take all necessary steps to prevent similar incidents in the future. The incident has also raised questions about the screening process for hotel employees, with many calling for stricter background checks to prevent dishonest individuals from being hired.
