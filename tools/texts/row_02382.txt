If you like the thrill of the open road but love the comfort of a luxury car, this unique superbike could be the perfect solution. The electric motorbike, dubbed the C-1, is a bizarre combination of car and bike and is set to hit our roads late next year. Created by San Francisco-based automotive company, Lit Motors, the fully-enclosed two-passenger bike uses a gyroscopic stabilising system to stay upright even when it's stationary. Clever: The C-1 stays upright, even when it's stationary . Luxury: The C-1 comes with a host of creature comforts with the makers claiming that it's a unique vehicle . The futuristic bike not only keeps its occupants warm and dry, it also keeps them safe - refusing to fall over even when hit in an accident. But this motorbike doesn't come cheap, it will set buyers back a hefty £15,000 with prices only dropping to £10,000 when production increases. A spokesman at Lit Motors said many people had tried to create something similar in the past but no-one had succeeded. He said: ‘No other vehicles on the road use gyros in this manner. There have been previous attempts but nothing like what we're doing. ‘Think of a child's spinning top toy, as long as it spins, it remains upright on its own, with no outside help. Similarly, as long as the gyros are spinning, the C-1 remains upright. ‘Ours is the only bike which stands upright on its own without training wheels. Best of both worlds: The makers say their invention combines the safety of a car with the fun of a motorbike . ‘This allows for a whole host of car-like features like a bucket seat, a steering wheel, a dashboard, climate control, a sound system, seatbelts and multiple airbags. ‘It is absolutely the first of its kind. The C-1 is a completely new class of vehicle, neither car nor motorcycle. ‘We have married the efficiency, agility, small size, and fun of a motorcycle with the stability, convenience, and most importantly the safety of a car. ‘The increased agility and smaller size as compared to a car means that many accidents can be avoided in the first place. ‘Rather than having to wear a helmet the driver can wear normal clothes, even a suit. The driver will stay safe being fully enclosed in a steel roll cage. Green credentials: The C-1 is fully electric, so it doesn't contribute to urban pollution . ‘We intend to take the C-1 around the world, starting in California and North America, then out to Europe, East Asia, Australia, South Asia, South America, and beyond. ‘We think it will be revolutionary and wildly popular. We're expecting a really strong following because we've created a new class of vehicle. ‘We've designed the perfect urban, commuter vehicle. It is fully electric, so not contributing to urban air pollution at all.’

chatgpt: The makers of the C-1 have taken safety and comfort to the next level. This cutting-edge vehicle uses a stabilizing system to stay upright at all times, even when at rest. This feature alone sets it apart from any other motorcycle on the market. In addition to its stability system, the C-1 comes equipped with air conditioning and multiple airbags. This makes it a great option for safety-conscious riders who value both comfort and protection. Traditional motorcycles offer little protection in the event of an accident or inclement weather, but the C-1 has changed the game. The C-1's stabilizing system uses gyroscopes and other technology to keep the vehicle upright, regardless of speed or outside forces. This system is similar to what's used in the Segway, another transportation innovation. The C-1's design makes it difficult to tip over, which is a major concern for many motorcyclists. This feature helps to prevent accidents and injuries, making it a top choice for safety-minded riders. Additionally, the C-1's air conditioning system takes comfort to a new level. Riders no longer have to endure sweltering heat during the summer months, making it a great option for those who use their motorcycle as their primary mode of transportation. The air conditioning system also helps to reduce fatigue during longer rides, allowing riders to stay alert and focused. Safety is a top priority for the makers of the C-1, which is why it comes equipped with multiple airbags. These airbags are strategically placed throughout the vehicle, including around the rider's body and head. In the event of a collision or accident, these airbags will deploy and provide an extra layer of protection. This feature alone can make all the difference in a serious accident. The C-1's innovative design also sets it apart from traditional motorcycles. Its enclosed cabin provides protection from the elements, which is particularly important during inclement weather. This feature also makes it a great option for those who plan to use it year-round. Riders no longer have to worry about getting drenched in the rain or exposed to the hot sun. Overall, the C-1 has transformed the motorcycle industry with its cutting-edge technology and emphasis on safety and comfort. Its stabilizing system, air conditioning, and multiple airbags make it a top choice for riders who prioritize safety and comfort above all else. Whether for commuting or pleasure, the C-1 is a game-changer. It's time to say goodbye to traditional motorcycles and hello to the future with the C-1.
