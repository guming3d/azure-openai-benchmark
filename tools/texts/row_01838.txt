article: Eight men have been jailed for 'inciting debauchery' after appearing in an alleged same-sex wedding video in Egypt. The men, who formed the wedding party on a boat on the Nile, were sentenced to three years in prison each for the crime of debauchery. The clip, posted online as 'Egypt's first gay wedding,' shows two men exchanging rings and embracing while friends cheer. In September, a statement from the office of Egypt's chief prosecutor said the video was 'shameful to God' and 'offensive to public morals.' Scroll down for video .

Today's verdict sentenced each of the men who appeared in an alleged same-sex prison to three years in jail . Although being gay is not illegal in Egypt, the men who appeared in the video were arrested last month and 'tested' for homosexuality. Officials subsequently said that they'd 'tested negative for homosexuality'. Precisely what the test involved has not been revealed, but it is thought to be an intrusive anal examination. The verdict is the latest in a crackdown by authorities against gays and atheists. The campaign also targets liberal and pro-democracy activists and violators of a draconian law on street protests. In the video clip purporting to be 'Egypt's first gay wedding' two men embrace after exchanging rings . Prosecutor General Hisham Barakat said the video 'violates public decency', but the Human Rights Watch have said that anal examinations 'violate international standards against torture'. Earlier this year, an Egyptian court convicted four men of committing 'homosexual acts' and sentenced them to up to eight years in prison. Police arrested the men for holding parties they say involved homosexual acts and where they found women's clothes and makeup. Three of the four received eight years while one received three years with hard labour. In 2011, a high profile trial of 52 men accused of being gay caught international attention and drew criticism from rights groups. Twenty-three of them were sentenced to up to five years in prison while the rest were acquitted. Although homosexuality is not illegal in Egypt, the men were convicted of debauchery, which is against the law . The verdict is the latest in a crackdown by authorities against gays, atheists, liberal and pro-democracy activists . Egypt's crackdown is taking place as the country of nearly 90 million people appears to be steadily moving to the right, with jingoism and xenophobia dominating the media .

chatgpt: Two men who appeared in an online video purporting to show "Egypt's first gay wedding" have been sentenced to three years in prison each, along with several others. The men were arrested shortly after the video was posted online last year and charged with the crime of "debauchery." At their trial, they were subsequently examined and declared "not homosexual." Homosexuality is not illegal in Egypt, but laws against "debauchery" and "promoting sexual deviancy" are often used to prosecute homosexuals. The case has raised concerns about the clamping down on LGBT rights in Egypt. The video that led to the arrests was circulated in September 2018, featuring two men who were reportedly getting married on a felucca, a traditional wooden sailing boat, on the River Nile. The clip shows the two men exchanging rings and embracing while a small group of men and boys onboard cheer them on. The footage sparked outrage in Egypt's conservative society, and authorities quickly launched an investigation into the video's creators and stars. After a swift trial, two men who appeared in the clip were convicted of "inciting debauchery and immorality" and sentenced to three years in prison each. Several others were also convicted in the case, including a man who allegedly filmed the video and another who was suspected of being the boat's captain. During the trial, the defense team for the two men argued that the video was staged as part of an advertising campaign for a company that had hired the two men as models. They further stated that the men are not homosexual, but merely acting as if they were. The court, however, rejected those arguments and the men were found guilty. After the trial, the two men were taken to prison to begin serving their sentences. The case has raised concerns among LGBT rights groups in Egypt, who fear that it signals a crackdown on the community. Amnesty International has spoken out against the case, labeling it a "shocking violation of human rights" and calling for the immediate release of the men. The organization's director for the Middle East and North Africa, Magdalena Mughrabi, said that the case was "yet another example of how Egyptian authorities are using the country's regressive morality laws to quash dissent and punish anyone who dares to deviate from the norm." The case has also sparked outrage among human rights activists around the world, who have called on the Egyptian government to respect the rights of all its citizens, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
