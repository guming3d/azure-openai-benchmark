chatgpt: Hull City manager Steve Bruce has praised Frank Lampard ahead of Manchester City's visit to KC Stadium on Sunday. The 36-year-old midfielder has been in fine form since joining City on loan from New York City FC earlier this season, scoring six goals in 13 appearances.  Bruce believes that if Lampard were in his prime today, he would be worth a staggering £70 million in the current transfer market. The City veteran's experience, vision, and exploits on the field have earned him the respect of Bruce and football fans around the globe.  Lampard had a storied career at Chelsea, where he spent 13 years and became the club's record goalscorer with 211 goals. He won multiple honors during his stint, including three Premier League titles, four FA Cups, and a UEFA Champions League crown in 2012.  Despite his impressive resume, Lampard has faced criticism this season for his move to Manchester City, as some pundits branded him a "mercenary." Nevertheless, Lampard has proven his worth on the pitch, and his impact on Manchester City's title charge cannot be understated. City currently sits in second place, just one point behind Chelsea, who beat Southampton 1-0 on Saturday.  On the other hand, Hull City is in the relegation zone, having won just three games this season. Bruce has had a difficult campaign so far, but he remains upbeat and is looking to make progress in the second half of the season.  When asked about Lampard, Bruce said: "He's been a terrific player. He's still got that incredible ability to find the back of the net, and he's been a fantastic signing for Manchester City. If he was at his peak now, he'd be worth £70 million in today's market, and that tells you what a player he is."  Although Lampard will be looking to impress against his former boss, Bruce is confident in his team's ability to get a result against City. He has called on his players to be brave and play their best football, knowing that a victory could be a turning point for the team's fortunes.  The match between Hull City and Manchester City promises to be an exciting affair, with both teams desperate for three points. For Lampard, it will be a chance to show that he's still one of the best midfielders in Europe, while for Bruce, it will be an opportunity to upset one of the league's giants and jump out of the relegation zone.
