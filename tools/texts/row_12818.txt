Clarin reports that police began investigating in February after his son-in-law, the husband of another one of his older daughters, visited a police station to report the allegations. 'The complainant stated that the girl had no boyfriend and it was the father who had abused her and got her pregnant,' said Manuel Ontiveros, from the Mendoza police sex crime unit. 'The man sometimes passed his daughter off as his wife, when he was asked by neighbours or people outside of the family,' Ontiveros added. A police source said that the man, who has not yet been named, had previously been accused of abusing one of his other daughters - who then left home. 'But as it was not rape, they gave him a suspended sentence and he was not jailed,' the source told Clarin. Authorities are now investigating whether the girl's mother, who left the family home six years ago, was complicit in her former husband's actions. Local media say the case has chilling echoes of Austrian psycho Josef Fritzl, who fathered seven children with daughter Elisabeth, who he kept locked inside a basement for 24 years.
