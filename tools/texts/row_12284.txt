article: London, England (CNN)  -- The pressure of playing for Real Madrid is greater than playing for Manchester United but Cristiano Ronaldo says he has settled into life at his new club. The Portuguese forward's first season in Spain since his world record $130-million move from England has been disrupted by injury. But Ronaldo has thrived on the pitch, scoring 20 goals in 19 appearances. "It's always complicated when you come from a different league, different football, but I feel very comfortable. The team play nice and they help me a lot," Ronaldo told CNN. But the 25-year-old, a former world and European footballer of the year, admitted that the pressure of being a Real Madrid player was more intense than anything he had experienced at Old Trafford. "Here in Spain, the club have more pressure," he said. "There are many people, more journalists, a lot of pressure." "But it's not a problem. I played six years for Manchester and you have to be calm all the time, you have to do what you do, to work and to train hard. I don't care about the pressure. I've always played with pressure and for me it is another challenge." Portugal, who reached the semifinals of the 2006 World Cup in Germany, struggled to qualify for this year's finals in South Africa, beating Bosnia and Herzegovina in a playoff to book their place. Could you be a World Cup super fan for CNN? Ronaldo failed to score in Portugal's qualifying campaign and he admitted it had been a difficult year for Portugal. But he said the team was stronger than its recent form suggested and said he was "keeping his goals for the World Cup." "This is the moment. We have to work and I'm really confident and I look forward to scoring goals at the world Cup," he said.

chatgpt: Cristiano Ronaldo, the Portuguese superstar, recently spoke to reporters about his time with Real Madrid, his thoughts on the pressure of playing in Spain, and his excitement for the upcoming World Cup. Ronaldo, who arrived in Madrid in 2009 as the world's most expensive player, said that he feels comfortable playing for Real Madrid. The Spanish giants have won the Champions League three times in the last four years, with Ronaldo playing a crucial role in those victories. However, the pressure in Spain is greater than in England, according to the 33-year-old forward. "In Spain, the pressure is bigger because of the quality of the teams, the players and the Champions League," said Ronaldo. "But I've always played with pressure. For me, it's another challenge." While the pressure may be mounting in Spain, Ronaldo is already looking ahead to the World Cup in Russia. "I am saving goals for the World Cup," he said. "I always give my best for my country, and I hope to do the same in Russia." Ronaldo will be representing Portugal in the upcoming World Cup, and he is hoping to improve on the team's performance from four years ago. In 2014, Portugal made it to the round of 16 before being eliminated by eventual champions Germany. Despite the pressure that comes with playing for a club like Real Madrid and representing your country at the World Cup, Ronaldo seems to thrive on those challenges. "I've always played with pressure," he said. "For me, it's another challenge." As one of the greatest footballers of all time, Ronaldo has certainly faced his fair share of challenges throughout his career. But with his unparalleled skill, determination, and ability to thrive under pressure, there's no doubt that he will continue to dominate on the pitch for years to come.
