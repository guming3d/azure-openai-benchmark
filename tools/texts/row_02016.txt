article: Davos, Switzerland (CNN) -- LeWeb founder Loic Le Meur is looking to "digital hippies" as a potential theme for his next conference. The French entrepreneur runs the biggest tech gathering in Europe and he's cautious to firm up a tagline too early. But when CNN caught up with him at the World Economic Forum in Davos, which he has attended for 11 years, he revealed what's on his mind. Why Davos matters in social media age . Le Meur is seeing a trend of entrepreneurs who reject money, fame and power -- they just want to be happy. They are digital hippies. Taking inspiration from events such as Nevada's art and music festival "Burning Man," which he attended for the first time in 2012, Le Meur told CNN digital hippies are: "Vegan, they don't drink alcohol, they want to know where their food comes from, they are trying to go slow when we are going fast." He referenced Apple's Steve Jobs and Virgin's Richard Branson as examples of those who began business as digital hippies. Digital hippies are creating a sharing economy -- one that includes creations like Wikipedia, Airbnb and Lyft -- without a focus on exchanging cash. At Burning Man, Le Meur "took $500 and came back with $500." The event, packed full of successful entrepreneurs, changed how he saw the world, Le Meur said. "It is a little crazy." Trump: Europe is open for business . Le Meur said the theme may be a bit risky, and he's a "little scared" it will scare his sponsors. Although "Peace, Tech and Love" seems a good tag, he added. Digital hippies are not the only trend on his radar. The return of hardware is another. In the world of apps, hardware can be unattractive for investors. But Le Meur points to the ability of hardware creations to entirely disrupt supply chains. "We build websites, then apps, and now we are back to hardware," Le Meur said. 3-D printing, for example, could revolutionize the way we buy products. "You need a knife and fork? You can print it. A glass? You can print it." Davos, a gathering of the world's elite, could not be further from the idea of digital hippies, but it serves an important role, Le Meur says. "It is the only place you can meet so many stakeholders. Instead of reading or watching the news you are in the news," he says. "I take out of it a lot of innovation, a lot of ideas, that you can use. But I don't come here with a specific goal. I come here very curious and try to learn."

chatgpt: Loic Le Meur, the founder of LeWeb, is considering the theme of "digital hippies" for his next conference. Le Meur has noticed a trend among entrepreneurs who reject traditional notions of success, such as money, fame, and power. Instead, they prioritize values such as social impact and sustainability. In an interview with CNBC, Le Meur stated, "The entrepreneurs I meet are not just looking to create the next Facebook or Google. They want to do good for the world." Le Meur believes that this shift in priorities is a positive development and something that should be highlighted in the tech industry. However, "digital hippies" are not the only trend on Le Meur's radar. He is also keeping an eye on the return of hardware. While software and internet-based startups have dominated the tech industry for years, Le Meur sees a resurgence in interest in physical products. Le Meur's experience at the World Economic Forum in Davos has informed his approach to building strong relationships in the tech industry. He notes that although the conference has received criticism for being a gathering for the world's elite, it can be a valuable opportunity for networking. LeWeb, founded in 2004, has established itself as one of Europe's premier tech conferences. Past speakers have included tech industry leaders such as Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey. The next conference is scheduled for November 2018 in Paris. Le Meur's theme for the next LeWeb conference is not yet finalized, but he believes that highlighting the trend of "digital hippies" could be beneficial for the tech industry. He stated, "I think that these entrepreneurs, who are focused more on a social impact rather than just creating the next billion-dollar company, are the future." Le Meur's interest in highlighting the social impact of tech entrepreneurs reflects a larger trend in the industry. Tech companies are increasingly facing pressure to be socially responsible and to address issues such as income inequality, privacy, and climate change. The 2018 LeWeb conference promises to be an exciting gathering of tech industry leaders and entrepreneurs. With the potential theme of "digital hippies," Le Meur is shaking up the traditional notions of success in the tech industry and challenging attendees to think about how they can have a positive impact on the world.
