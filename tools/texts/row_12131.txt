article: By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:55 EST, 7 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:11 EST, 7 November 2013 . The CIA is paying AT&T more than $10million a year to provide phone records for overseas counter-terrorism investigations adding another agency to the list of government offices tapping into citizen's phone logs. The New York Times quoted government officials confirming that the second-biggest American mobile service provider is cooperating under a voluntary contract. That means that this partnership is a financial one, and AT&T is not under subpoenas or court orders compelling the company to participate. Paying customers: The CIA pays AT&T $10million to hand over information about potential terrorists, and the financial deal proves that the partnership between the phone company and the agency is not forced . AT&T did not confirm or deny the report but said payments from governments were routine for lawful data. The report comes amid widespread political uproar after former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden leaked documents describing how the U.S. government collects far more internet and telephone data than previously known. Under the AT&T arrangement, the CIA supplies phone numbers of overseas terrorism suspects and AT&T searches its database to provide call records that may help identify foreign associates, the paper said. Most of the call logs provided by AT&T involve foreign-to-foreign calls, the paper said. AT&T does not disclose the identity of the Americans calling from the United States, and masks their phone numbers when it produces the records, the paper said, quoting the officials. That does little to block the CIA from finding out the Americans involved, however, as it just means that they have to jump through some bureaucratic hoops first. Another agency: Previous phone tapping revelations concerned the NSA, and now this proves that the CIA (pictured) is involved in very similar operations with the help of the FBI . The CIA is tasked with handling security threats abroad and does not have the rights to obtain certain information about domestic citizens- which is left for the FBI. To get the information that AT&T obstructs, The Times says that the CIA asks the FBI to order an administrative subpoena to AT&T, forcing the company to hand over the personal data of the phone number in question. The FBI then shares that information with the CIA. AT&T said all government data requests were handled in a lawful and proper manner. 'We ensure that we maintain customer information in compliance with the laws of the United States and other countries where information may be maintained,' AT&T spokesman Mark Siegel said in an emailed statement. 'Like all telecom providers, we routinely charge governments for producing the information provided.'

chatgpt: New reports have emerged revealing that AT&T has profited from turning records over to the CIA. The government source has confirmed the financial relationship between the two organizations, while AT&T has not commented on the situation. However, the telecommunications company stated that they continue to help in public safety operations at the request of the government. The CIA, which focuses on global security, has shown an interest in Americans making international calls to possible terror suspects abroad. This comes after leaked documents proved that the NSA was gathering information on phone and internet records of American citizens. This news has sparked outrage among civil liberties groups, who have long argued against the government's surveillance practices. They see this latest revelation as a blatant disregard for Americans' privacy and constitutional rights. Sarah St. Vincent, the Human Rights Watch member, stated that "AT&T profits from facilitating international calls to terrorist suspects, and then turned over records of those calls to the CIA for surveillance. The practice is alarming, and we need to ensure that the government is not violating our rights." The reported relationship between AT&T and the CIA has come to light at a time of increased concern about government surveillance from both the public and lawmakers. The House of Representatives voted to limit the government's ability to collect the phone and internet records of Americans. It remains unclear if the Senate will pass the bill. Privacy advocates have also expressed concern about the lack of transparency surrounding the government's relationship with telecommunications companies. AT&T is not the only company suspected of cooperating with the government's surveillance programs, and the public has no way of knowing the full extent of their involvement. Despite these concerns, the government has defended their actions as necessary to protect national security. They argue that the information gathered from these records has helped to prevent terrorist attacks in the past and will continue to do so in the future. In conclusion, the latest reports of AT&T profiting from turning over records to the CIA have reignited the debate over government surveillance and the limits of privacy in the digital age. While some argue that such practices are necessary for national security, others view them as unconstitutional violations of civil liberties. It remains to be seen how this controversy will play out in the coming months and years.
