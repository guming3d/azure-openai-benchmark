article: Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Militants launched a fresh attack Monday in Nigeria's second largest city, Kano, which is already reeling from a series of bombings and shootings that killed more than 200 people earlier this month. A police station in Mandawari was attacked at 6 a.m., just after the dusk-to-dawn curfew was lifted, police said. No one was hurt. Hours earlier, gunmen on motorbikes hit a police station in Naibowa, killing two people. The Sunday evening attack lasted about 40 minutes, said Sani Abdu, a resident who lives close to the station. No one immediately claimed responsibility, but suspicion fell on the militant group Boko Haram, which has carried out multiple bombings and shootings across the north in recent days. On January 20, at least 211 people were killed in Kano in attacks that left the police headquarters and other government buildings in charred ruins. In response, President Goodluck Jonathan fired the west African nation's inspector general of police. Depending on the faction, Boko Haram's ambitions range from the stricter enforcement of Islamic Sharia law to the total destruction of the government. Its grievances remain local, but it has attacked international institutions --- such as the United Nations -- on Nigerian soil. An August 26 attack -- during which a Boko Haram suicide bomber drove a Jeep laden with explosives into the U.N. headquarters in Abuja -- was one of the deadliest in the world body's history. Twenty-four people were killed, including 12 U.N. staff. The group was formed in 2002 by Islamic preacher Mohammad Yusuf as an outgrowth of ethnic tensions in the country in the 1990s. Nigeria's population is split between mostly Muslims living in the north and predominantly Christians in the south. Yusuf advocated the institution of Sharia law throughout the northern states and opposed democracy. The group operated openly out of northeastern Nigeria and staged small-scale attacks against government targets. In 2009, Nigerian police forces moved to crack down on Boko Haram. Harsh police tactics led to an armed uprising and the arrest of Yusuf, who later died in police custody. The death spurred the group to begin its attacks on police stations. Ensuing clashes between group members and the police killed hundreds. Journalist Hassan John in Jos contributed to this report .

chatgpt: In a disturbing pattern that is becoming all too common in Nigeria, police stations across the country are facing an unprecedented number of attacks that are leaving officers and civilians alike dead or injured. The latest attack came yesterday when gunmen attacked a police station in the city of Maiduguri, a city that has been the scene of some of the worst violence perpetrated by the Islamist group, Boko Haram. Police say that the attack on the police station was carried out by Boko Haram, an extremist group that has been responsible for a wave of violence that has left thousands dead over the past few years. The group is known for its ruthless tactics, including mass kidnappings, suicide bombings, and attacks on schools and other public places. The attack in Maiduguri follows a wave of similar incidents across Nigeria where groups of armed men have attacked police stations, leaving officers and civilians dead or injured. Police say that the attackers are often well-armed and well-coordinated, making it difficult for local law enforcement to respond effectively. Boko Haram has been blamed for much of the violence, with the group claiming responsibility for a number of high-profile attacks, including the bombing of a church in Jos in 2012 that left over 50 people dead. The group has also been linked to the kidnapping of over 200 schoolgirls in Chibok in 2014, a case that has received international attention and condemnation. In response to the wave of attacks on police stations, authorities have stepped up security measures, including increased armed patrols and checkpoints. However, many are calling for more action to be taken to tackle the root causes of the violence. Some have criticized the government's handling of the situation, saying that the authorities have failed to address the underlying issues such as poverty, unemployment, and corruption, which are seen as contributing factors to the rise of extremist groups like Boko Haram. Despite the challenges, the government and the security forces remain determined to tackle the threat posed by Boko Haram and other extremist groups. In a statement following yesterday's attack, the police commissioner in Maiduguri vowed that the authorities would do everything in their power to bring those responsible to justice. As the violence continues, many are left wondering how long it will take before the authorities are able to put an end to the bloodshed and restore stability to the country. For now, however, the attacks on police stations are likely to continue, leaving officers and civilians to face an uncertain and dangerous future.
