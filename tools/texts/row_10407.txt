article: BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- I've spoken to doctors in Baghdad before, but never one this optimistic. Solar panels similar to these are bringing renewable and regular power to two clinics in Iraq. When I interviewed Dr. Thamer Al-Musawi, he told me his clinic is offering new hope to their patients. Not because of any new medicines housed inside. But because of the high tech equipment placed on the outside -- 64 solar panels to be precise. About 4 months ago, they were installed on the roof of the Al-Dakhil Medical Center, where Dr. Thamer works, as part of a project being underwritten by the U.S. Military and supported by Iraq's Health Ministry. Only two other clinics in all of Iraq have been given access to the same technology. Dr. Thamer excitedly explained its significance. "It means we can give our patients the care and medical aid they need," he said, "and we can do it 24 hours a day." Round the clock medical care may not sound like anything special, but in Iraq, where the power grid is unreliable and blackouts are frequent, most clinics can open only a few hours a day. And that's not the worst of it. Without dependable electricity, Dr. Thamer explained, certain medications can't be kept at the right temperatures. At one point, Al-Dakhil even had to cancel their children's vaccine program because the vaccinations couldn't be stored properly. That all changed with the arrival of the panels -- for a few months at least. The clinic recently suffered a setback. Before we visited, someone tampered with a key circuit board and that's preventing the clinic from using electricity still being stored in the batteries. Until it's fixed, Al-Dakhil is back to using what most other clinics must use, expensive and polluting diesel generators. But that hasn't dampened Dr. Thamer's enthusiasm. He fully expects the solar panels will be powering the clinic again within a few days. As a doctor in Baghdad, he's faced far worse, and he's determined to overcome this challenge. More than anything, he simply wants to make sure his patients can get access to the best care possible.

chatgpt: CNN recently visited one of the only three solar-powered clinics in the whole of Iraq. Despite facing setbacks, the clinic's doctor is optimistic that the solar-powered clinic will benefit the community in ways that could not have been possible through the unreliable national grid. The national electricity grid in Iraq has been in a state of disarray for a long time, leaving many hospitals and clinics with power cuts for hours, if not days on end. This has been worsened by years of conflict and a lack of investment in infrastructure. The situation has been particularly perilous for medical facilities that require a constant supply of electricity to power medical equipment and store essential medicines. The solar-powered clinic being visited by CNN is situated in a deprived neighbourhood where residents were struggling to access basic healthcare services. The solar installation is expected to solve the problem of unreliable power supply and inadequate storage of medicines. Dr. Haidar Al-Rubaie, the lead doctor at the clinic, is optimistic about the impact of the solar-powered facility on the community. He notes that previously, they were forced to throw away many essential medicines that got spoilt due to lack of proper refrigeration. With the solar panels providing reliable and clean energy, they can now store their medication safely and reduce wastage. Dr. Al-Rubaie also highlights that the facility's reliance on solar energy has brought many other benefits to the clinic. "We operate in a region where high temperatures are prevalent, and our patients have to endure these harsh conditions. With solar energy, we can provide a conducive environment for both patients and medical personnel", he said. However, the solar clinic has not been without challenges. Dr. Al-Rubaie noted that obtaining the necessary permits for the installation proved to be challenging. The cost of setting up the facility, including the necessary equipment, was also considerable. However, the benefits of having a dependable source of power for the facility far outweighs the costs. The success of this solar-powered clinic is a beacon of hope for many other medical facilities in Iraq. By investing in renewable energy sources, facilities can provide reliable access to healthcare even in areas where energy is scarce. In conclusion, the introduction of solar-powered medical facilities in Iraq has brought a much-needed relief to communities that have suffered from inadequate healthcare services due to power outages. The solar-powered clinic in the deprived neighbourhood is a promising example that paves the way for other institutions to adopt renewable energy sources to improve service delivery.
