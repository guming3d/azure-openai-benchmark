article: (CNN) -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Wednesday made his second public speech, signaling a departure in leadership style from his late father. Speaking to tens of thousands of children in Pyongyang on the 66th anniversary of the Korean Children's Union, Kim said the country has a good future. "Korea's future depends on you," he said. "The Korea you are in charge of will be a country full of laughter and happiness, and also the strongest country in the world." Kim said the country has the latest rocket technology and called on the children to study hard, saying they cannot contribute to the nation if their grades are bad. In April, North Korea carried out a failed rocket launch that it said was to put a satellite into orbit. Other countries, including South Korea and the United States, assumed it was a coverup for testing its ballistic missile technology. About 20,000 children were transported to Pyongyang from around the country for the occasion , state-run KCNA reported. North Korean television showed footage of many children sobbing with emotion as their leader spoke. Kim Jong Un also spoke at the 100th anniversary of the birth of North Korean founder, Kim Il Sung. His father, Kim Jong Il, is believed to have made only one brief broadcast throughout his reign, showing his son is creating his own individual persona. The speech is also considered a way for Kim Jong Un to try to win over a new generation as he continues to shore up support for his hereditary succession. A North Korean expert says the speech shows Kim Jong Un is more similar to his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, than his father, which is what the nation's propaganda machine has emphasized. "His grandfather, unlike his father, was a reasonably good speaker, not charismatic, but he could talk for hours if necessary and was clearly not shy when it came to talking in public, it was part of the image," said Professor Andrei Lankov of Kookmin University.

chatgpt: In a rare move, North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un delivered an unusual speech that signaled a change in the country's leadership style. The speech, which was attended by thousands of children from across the country, was seen as an attempt by the leader to win over a new generation and cement his authority as North Korea's supreme leader. Addressing the young audience, Kim spoke of the importance of education and emphasized that their future and the future of North Korea depended on them. "Korea's future depends on you," he said, adding that they needed to work hard and be loyal to the country's ruling Workers' Party. This speech represents a departure from the leadership style of Kim's late father, Kim Jong Il, who was known for his reclusive personality and for making infrequent public appearances. In contrast, Kim Jong Un has been much more visible and vocal in his public addresses, and he has tried to present himself as a leader who is more approachable and in touch with the needs of the North Korean people. For Kim Jong Un, winning over the hearts and minds of the younger generation is crucial for the longevity of his regime. North Korea has been under international sanctions for years, and the country's economic woes have been worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic. The younger generation will soon be the ones who will take the reins of the country, and Kim knows that he needs their support if his regime is to survive. The speech was also notable for its timing. It came just days after North Korea celebrated the 73rd anniversary of its founding. Kim's speech was seen as an attempt to present himself as a confident and capable leader who is steering the country towards a bright future. While it remains to be seen if Kim's efforts to win over the younger generation will be successful, the speech is a clear indication that North Korea's leadership style is changing. Whether this change will lead to more openness and engagement with the outside world, or whether it will simply reinforce the country's hermit-like status, remains to be seen. But for now, Kim Jong Un seems intent on cementing his control over North Korea's future and securing his legacy as a leader who took the country to greater heights.
