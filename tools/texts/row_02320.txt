article: JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Some Israeli archaeologists are having a particularly happy Hanukkah, thanks in part to a British volunteer who took time off from her job to work on a dig. Archaeologists found a hoard of gold coins from the 7th century in Jerusalem on Sunday. The Israel Antiquities Authority reported a thrilling find Sunday -- the discovery of 264 ancient gold coins in Jerusalem National Park. The coins were minted during the early 7th century. "This is one of the largest and most impressive coin hoards ever discovered in Jerusalem -- certainly the largest and most important of its period," said Doron Ben-Ami and Yana Tchekhanovets, who are directing the excavation on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority. Researchers discovered the coins at the beginning of the eight-day Jewish holiday of Hanukkah, which started at sunset on Sunday. One of the customs of the holiday is to give "gelt," or coins, to children, and the archaeologists are referring to the find as "Hanukkah money." Nadine Ross, a British archaeological volunteer, happened onto the coins during the dig just below the walls of the Old City of Jerusalem. "To be honest, I just thought, 'Thank God I didn't throw it in the rubbish bucket,' " said Ross, who had taken four weeks off from her engineering job in England to work at the site. "I was just glad I sort of spotted it before I disturbed it too much." The 1,400-year-old coins were found in the Giv'ati car park in the City of David in the walls around Jerusalem National Park, a site that has yielded other finds, including a well-preserved gold earring with pearls and precious stones. They were in a collapsed building that dates back to the 7th century, the end of the Byzantine period.  The coins bear a likeness of Heraclius, who was the Byzantine emperor from 610 to 641. The authority said that while different coins had been minted during this emperor's reign, the coins found at the site represent "one well-known type." In that style, the emperor is clad with military garb and is holding a cross in his right hand. On the other side is the sign of the cross. Authorities said the excavation of the building where the hoard was discovered is in its early stages. They are attempting to learn about the building and its owner and the circumstances of its destruction. "Since no pottery vessel was discovered adjacent to the hoard, we can assume that it was concealed inside a hidden niche in one of the walls of the building. It seems that with its collapse, the coins piled up there among the building debris," Ben-Ami and Tchekhanovets said. The find is a a golden moment for Ross, who said "it is a pity that I can't take it home with me. But there you go." CNN's Shira Medding and Ben Wedeman contributed to this report.

chatgpt: A British volunteer made a fascinating discovery while helping to excavate the City of David, a historic site in Jerusalem. While sorting through debris in a collapsed building, she stumbled upon a group of ancient coins. Minted during the 7th century, the coins depict the Byzantine emperor of the era. Excited by her find, the volunteer exclaimed, "Pity that I can't take it home!" While it's tempting to imagine what the coins might fetch on the open market, experts are more interested in the coins' historical significance. Researchers quickly jumped into action to analyze the coins and learn more about their origin. According to Dr. Doron Ben-Ami of the Israel Antiquities Authority, the coins were found in a Byzantine-era car park that has been under excavation for several years. The discovery of the coins adds to the rich store of knowledge about the culture of the time. During the 7th century, the Byzantine Empire was in a precarious position, facing threats from all directions. The coins found in the City of David paint a vivid picture of the era, with intricate engravings and depictions of the emperor that provide rare glimpses into the past. Still, their discovery is not without controversy. Some critics have questioned the archaeological methods used to uncover the coins, pointing out that such methods can disrupt delicate balance of discoveries. Despite these challenges, the researchers believe that the discovery of the coins adds to our understanding of the ancient world. By studying the artifacts and the context in which they were found, researchers can gain insights into the lives of people living in ancient times. The coins are a testament to the skill and artistry of the people who created them, as well as the complex web of political, religious, and economic relationships that defined the era. As for the British volunteer who made the discovery, she is likely to remember the experience for years to come. While she may have been disappointed not to be able to take the coins home, her find will be forever remembered as an important contribution to the ongoing work of archaeologists in Jerusalem.
