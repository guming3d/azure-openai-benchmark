article: (CNN) -- With the two sides unable to come to contract terms, the NFL locked out its referees before the preseason began. Here are some of the issues that are on the table between the NFL, its 32 owners and the 121 officials. PAY . The money to pay officials comes from a pot of $18 million funded by the league. The NFL wants an increase in the average salary for officials, who are part-time employees, from $149,000 to $189,000 by 2018. Referees (the head officials) and officials who qualify for postseason games would make more, the league said. The raises each year would fall between 5% and 11%, the league said. The officials have asked for more, but have not publicly disclosed how much. They say the league, which has revenues of more than $9 billion per year, can afford it. NFL: Packers should have won . RETIREMENT PLAN . The league wants to switch from a pension plan to a 401k plan. The league said in a July statement: "No game official will lose any vested pension benefit under our proposal and the clubs will fully fund all pension obligations." But the executive director of the referees association said in an open letter to the media last week that plan would transfer long-term investment risk to the officials and would cut the league's financial obligation by 60%. Tim Millis said 18 of the league's teams have some form of defined-benefit program rather than a 401k system. The league said their plan will give the officials a larger retirement benefit. The officials have proposed that only new hires be moved to the 401k plan. SI: NFL Holds firm in negotiations . MORE RESERVE CREWS . According to Peter King of Sports Illustrated the league would like to add three crews of seven people in reserve with the option to use these referees to replace underperforming officials. That would add 21 officials to the pool and officials fear it would affect their job security. Referees are only paid for games worked, so anyone who was "benched" would lose pay. Chorus for NFL referees grows . FULL-TIME OFFICIALS . Right now each official works a full-time job and refs in his free time. Officials also have to watch game tape, file reports to the league office and take a weekly written test on the rules. One veteran referee told ESPN that all that, coupled with keeping in shape, takes 30 hours a week. The league wants to hire seven full-time officials and have them handle training and scouting. The officials' association has said it would OK with that, if the referees were paid a fair amount. Photos: Blown calls in sports history .

chatgpt: In a move that threatens to disrupt the upcoming National Football League season, 121 officials have been locked out by the league over a dispute on compensation. The disagreement stems from how much should be added to the compensation pool each year, with the league proposing a 401k while the officials want to maintain the current pension system. The officials, who work as referees for NFL games, are a key part of the game and their absence could have major impacts on the outcomes of games. The league has already announced its intention to add 21 more officials to their roster, but it has been suggested that not everyone would work each week in an effort to mitigate the impact of the lockout. Speaking on the situation, a representative for the officials stated that, "All of us are united in one common goal: we want to get back to work, doing the job we've been trained to do. We're willing to work with the league to find a solution that works for both sides, but we won't compromise on the things that matter most to us." The current pension system has been a key point of contention in the negotiations, with the league claiming that it is not financially sustainable in the long-term. They have proposed a 401k system, which would see the officials contributing a percentage of their salary to a retirement account. However, the officials have argued that the pension system has been a key part of their compensation package for years and that it provides them with more financial security in their retirement. They have also raised concerns that the new 401k system would not benefit them as much as the league claims. The lockout could not have come at a worse time for the league, with the upcoming football season set to start in just a few weeks. It is unclear how long the lockout will last, but both sides have expressed a willingness to continue negotiations in an effort to find a resolution. In the meantime, the league has announced plans to use replacement officials for the upcoming games. However, there are concerns that these officials may not have the same level of experience or training as the regular officials, which could lead to mistakes and controversies on game day. Fans and players alike have expressed frustration and disappointment with the lockout, with many calling for a speedy resolution. The league has urged patience and understanding from all parties as they work to find a solution that works for everyone. As the negotiations continue, the fate of the upcoming NFL season hangs in the balance. Fans will be watching closely to see if a resolution can be reached in time for the games to go ahead with the regular officials in place.
