If you usually take armfuls of outfits into the changing room but end up with just one at the till, don’t worry ladies – you’re not alone. Only one in ten of the items tried on in clothes shops end up being bought, a survey found. Even those that make it out of the store may never be worn, according to the research. The average woman spends around £40 a month on clothes which simply linger at the back of her wardrobe. Four in ten British women go shopping once a fortnight and eight in ten say they love the experience . But while they may be particularly picky in a high street changing room, women are much more likely to keep goods bought online. A quarter of all clothes bought on the internet are never returned to retailers. The survey also revealed that British women struggle to define their personal style. Only 39 per cent of the 2,000 who were . questioned claimed to be confident about knowing which clothes and . accessories suited their look and figure. Despite their struggles in the changing room, most women – 81 per cent – said they enjoyed shopping for clothes. One in ten said they went shopping on a . daily basis, while the same proportion said they bought ‘fashion’ items once a week.

chatgpt: A new survey of more than 1,000 British women has found that a significant number of them struggle to identify clothing items that look good on them. In fact, nearly 40 percent of respondents said that they lack the ability to pick out items that suit them. Despite this challenge, the survey revealed that a vast majority of British women still love to shop. More than 80 percent of respondents admitted to indulging in shopping, despite their perception that they aren't able to identify good buys. The survey's findings offer some interesting insights into the psychology of shopping and consumer behavior. Many women might feel a sense of excitement and pleasure when they enter a store, but may become quickly overwhelmed by the sheer number of choices available – especially when it comes to clothing. This can lead to feelings of indecision and anxiety, which can negatively impact their ability to identify good deals. The study also highlighted potential areas for improvement in the shopping experience. Retailers may want to consider offering more personalized options, such as virtual styling services or personalized recommendations based on a customer's size and preferences. This could help customers feel more confident in their choices, and could also lead to more repeat business. Another interesting finding from the study was that there were few significant differences between age groups or income brackets in terms of purchasing decisions. While some might assume that younger or wealthier women would be better at picking out clothes, the survey showed that this was not the case. This suggests that there may be some underlying factors at play when it comes to shopping behavior. For example, women who feel more confident in their appearance and are more comfortable with their body shape may be more likely to take risks and try new styles. By contrast, women who are less confident may stick with safe, conservative choices – even if they don't necessarily make them feel good about themselves. Overall, the survey's results offer a compelling glimpse into the complex world of shopping and consumer behavior. While many women may feel frustrated by their perceived inability to identify good buys, there are plenty of positive steps that they can take to boost their confidence and make more informed shopping decisions. By staying aware of their own preferences and limitations, and being open to new experiences, women can transform shopping from a stressful experience into an enjoyable and rewarding one.
