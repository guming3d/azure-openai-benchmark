article: (CNN) -- Already dubbed a horse racing "rock star," California Chrome's owners are laying plans to maximize the thoroughbred's rising profile ahead of the colt's bid to win the Belmont Stakes and the Triple Crown. Having won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes -- the other two legs of the Triple Crown -- California Chrome would become the first horse since Affirmed in 1978 to achieve the ultimate feat in thoroughbred racing should he triumph in New York next month. Owners Steve Coburn and Perry Martin and their wives Carolyn Coburn and Denise Martin, have registered the name with the U.S. Patent and Trademark office, according to records filed on Thursday May 15. The move will give the owners license to use the name "California Chrome" on athletic apparel including shirts, pants, jackets, footwear, hats and caps. The three-year-old colt is arguably rapidly becoming the biggest racing sensation since the retirements of Frankel and Black Caviar. Frankel, who retired undefeated after winning all 14 of his races in October 2012, was estimated to be worth $168 million. Black Caviar, the mare who dominated Australian racing, retired in April 2013 after 25 consecutive victories and amassing nearly eight million dollars in prize money. She was featured on the front page of Australian Vogue magazine and was even voted as the country's top sportswoman. Only 11 of the 38 horses who have won the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes have gone on to complete the dream treble with victory at the Belmont Stakes. The colt coasted to victory in Baltimore last Saturday to win the 139th Preakness Stakes -- and is now favourite for victory in the $1.5 million race in New York on June 7. California Chrome was born to a mare named Love the Chase, purchased by Coburn and Martin for $8,000 with a view to breeding. She was bred to the stallion Lucky Pulpit for a reduced fee of $2,000, the first breeding the novice pair had ever undertaken. Their offspring had earned Coburn and Perry more than $2.3 million in prize money before the Preakness, also chalking up wins at the Santa Anita Derby, San Felipe Stakes and California Cup Derby. After its Preakness success California Chrome became front page news after New York racing officials decided to allow the three-year-old to wear a breathing strip during the Belmont Stakes. His owners might not have allowed him to race without a strip, which the manufacturer says allows horses to breathe more freely and reduces the risk of bleeding in the lungs during heavy exertion. California Chrome has worn the strips during his last six wins, including those first-place finishes at the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes.

chatgpt: Owners of the famous racehorse, California Chrome, have applied to trademark its name. The horse is currently aiming to win the coveted Triple Crown, having already won both the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes. The horse’s owners, Perry Martin and Steve Coburn, are looking to protect their horse's name and brand in anticipation of potential future earnings. After coming out victorious from the first two legs of the Triple Crown, all eyes are now on California Chrome as he prepares for the Belmont Stakes in New York. Last week, it was announced that the horse would indeed be allowed to wear his signature nasal strips during the race, following an outcry from fans and owners alike. The use of nasal strips has been a controversial topic in the horse racing world. While the strips are commonly used in training, they were banned in some races because they were believed to enhance a horse's performance. However, following California Chrome’s victories in both the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes, his owners argued the strips were not performance-enhancing and should be allowed at the Belmont Stakes. Ultimately, they have been cleared for use. The Belmont Stakes is considered the most challenging race in the Triple Crown, with horses needing to cover a distance of 1.5 miles. California Chrome has already proved himself over shorter distances, but this will be the first time that he competes at such a prolonged distance. However, his impressive winning streak has shown that he is more than capable of pulling off this feat. The odds are currently in California Chrome's favor, with many experts predicting he has a good chance of winning the Triple Crown. However, the horse will face stiff competition from other well-regarded racehorses such as Commissioner, Tonalist, and Wicked Strong. Fans are eagerly awaiting the race, which will take place on June 7 at the Belmont Park. If California Chrome does win the Belmont Stakes, he will become the first horse since 1978 to win the prestigious Triple Crown. This would solidify his place in horse racing history and cement his owners' decision to trademark his name. The trademark application covers merchandise such as hats, shirts, and jackets, as well as endorsing products like saddles, barns, and racing stables. California Chrome has already won the hearts of many fans with his impressive racing record and charming personality. Despite his success, his owners remain humble and appreciative of the opportunities presented to them. They hope that their beloved racehorse can bring joy and excitement to people's lives and inspire others to believe in their dreams. As the day of the Belmont Stakes draws closer, fans around the world anticipate California Chrome's performance, eagerly hoping he can secure his place in racing history.
