'Maybe it also shows that when we meet heads of state and government, we too are just people who have fun.' In an interview with Danish Daily Berlinske, she added: 'There was a sadness, but it was basically a festive event that also celebrated a man who has lived for 95 years and achieved so much in his life. 'There was dancing on the stands. And then we took a really fun selfie.' The Danish Prime Minister has enjoyed a glamorous reputation in her native country since being elected in 2011 . Obama, Cameron and Thorning-Schmidt were captured taking the picture at the FNB Stadium near Johannesburg on Tuesday, as thousands of mourners gathered to pay tribute to Nelson Mandela. The photograph was taken shortly after President Obama gave a reverent speech about the former South African President and civil rights campaigner who died aged 95 at the weekend. The White House has not commented on the photograph, but David Cameron this week brushed off the incident. During Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons he said: 'In my defense, I would say that Nelson Mandela played an extraordinary role in his life and in his death in bringing people together. So of course when a member of the Kinnock family asked me for a photograph, I thought it was only polite to say yes.'

It led to a backlash from Twitter users who said it was inappropriate behaviour at an event to remember the life of the anti-apartheid hero, who died last week aged 95. Twitter user James Armitage wrote: 'What selfish morons take a "selfie" at a memorial service? Oh yeah that's right, Barack Obama and David Cameron.' In a message directed at Mr Cameron, Sarah McDermott said: 'You have precisely zero class or decorum.'

chatgpt: Former Prime Minister of Denmark, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, has defended the infamous "selfie" taken by herself, former UK Prime Minister David Cameron, and former US President Barack Obama at the memorial service for Nelson Mandela in 2013. Thorning-Schmidt described the photo as a "really fun selfie" that was taken in the spirit of the event. The photograph shows the three leaders huddled together, with Thorning-Schmidt holding a smartphone and capturing the moment. The image caused controversy at the time, as some felt it was inappropriate to take such a casual photo at a solemn occasion. However, Thorning-Schmidt argued that it was simply a spontaneous moment that occurred during a day of mourning and celebration. Speaking about the photo in an interview with CNN, Thorning-Schmidt said, "It was a very spontaneous thing. We were just having a laugh, and I think in the spirit of the event, it was a really fun selfie." The memorial service was held in Johannesburg, South Africa, and was attended by world leaders and celebrities from around the globe. Obama had been invited to give the main eulogy for Mandela, who had passed away a few days earlier. His speech was widely praised for its eloquence and warmth, and he received a standing ovation from the crowd. Following the ceremony, the three leaders were sitting together in the VIP area when Thorning-Schmidt pulled out her phone and suggested they take a photo. Obama and Cameron leaned in, and the now-famous selfie was born. Thorning-Schmidt acknowledged the criticism the photo received, saying, "I understand why some people were upset, because it was a memorial service, and it was a sad occasion. But I think sometimes it's okay to have a little bit of levity, and to just have a laugh with your friends." The incident became known as the "selfiegate" scandal, and was widely covered by the media. Some commentators felt that the image was disrespectful to Mandela's memory, while others defended it as a harmless moment of camaraderie between world leaders. Despite the controversy, Thorning-Schmidt maintains that the photo was in keeping with the spirit of the event, which was both a tribute to Mandela's life and a celebration of his legacy. She added, "I think Nelson Mandela would have appreciated the fact that we were able to come together across political and national lines, and just have a moment of fun together." The photo has since become a pop culture icon, and has been recreated in various forms by fans and public figures alike. It remains a testament to the power of spontaneous moments and the enduring bonds of friendship, even in the face of tragedy. In conclusion, the "selfiegate" scandal may have caused a stir at the time, but Thorning-Schmidt's defense of the photo as a "really fun selfie" reminds us that sometimes, even at the most solemn of occasions, it's important to find moments of joy and camaraderie. The photo will undoubtedly go down in history as a symbol of the legacy of Nelson Mandela, and of the power of friendship and unity to transcend political and national boundaries.
