article: (CNN) -- A message thought to be from al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri criticizes the ouster of Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy and urges Muslims to stand together to prevent Egypt from being divided. The 14-minute audio message -- which purportedly is al-Zawahiri's second this week -- was posted to jihadist forums on Friday. CNN could not independently verify its authenticity. The language used in the last posting resembles that in other messages attributed to al-Zawahiri in which he criticizes the treatment from various parties of Morsy, the former Muslim Brotherhood leader who last year became Egypt's first democratically elected president. "The crusaders, the seculars, the Americanized army, (former President Hosni) Mubarak's thugs and some members of Islamic parties with the support of Gulf money and American plotting, all agreed to topple Mohamed Morsy's government," he says. Who is Ayman al-Zawahiri? Those behind Morsy's ouster, the message states, wanted a "secular, pro-American president to rule Egypt so they can continue with their plotting -- along with the Americans and Zionists -- to divide Egypt, just like what happened in Sudan." The 62-year-old Al-Zawahiri is no stranger to Egypt or its politics. A member of a distinguished Egyptian family, he is a surgeon who with the Egyptian Islamic Jihad tried to overthrow President Anwar Sadat and establish an Islamic state. After Sadat's assassination, al-Zawahiri was arrested and convicted on weapons charges. He met Osama bin Laden in the late 1980s and, in about a decade later, merged the Egyptian Islamic Jihad with al Qaeda. Al Qaeda's boss asserts himself . The message posted Friday comes three days days after another message purportedly from al-Zawahiri appeared online, although it was believed to be recorded June 5. In that message, the voice purportedly of al-Zawahiri denounced U.S. treatment of hunger-striking detainees at its Guantanamo Bay military prison and pledged to free them. He also urged Muslims -- as he and other al Qaeda leaders have many times before -- to unite and fight. "Every Muslim in every spot on Earth must work to defend the blood of Muslims that is being shed by America and its allies, and their sanctities that they are violating, and their villages and homes that they are destroying, and their wealth that they are stealing," he said. CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.

chatgpt: A message allegedly from Ayman al-Zawahiri, the current leader of al-Qaeda, has been posted to jihadist online forums. The message is reportedly critical of the way jihadist groups treated and ousted former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi. The message also accuses Egypt's current rulers of collaborating with the Americans and Zionists to divide the country. In the message, al-Zawahiri begins by lamenting the death of Morsi, who died in June 2019 while being held in custody by the Egyptian authorities. Al-Zawahiri describes Morsi as a "martyr" and a "champion of the Islamic project." However, al-Zawahiri also criticizes the approach taken by jihadist groups towards Morsi's presidency, arguing that they were too focused on seeking power rather than supporting Islamic principles. He alleges that some groups "turned against" Morsi and his supporters, thereby helping the Egyptian military to overthrow him. Al-Zawahiri also takes aim at Egypt's current rulers, who he accuses of collaborating with the United States and Israel to divide the country. He claims that these rulers have "betrayed" the people of Egypt by working with foreign powers to undermine the country's sovereignty. The message ends with a call to arms, urging jihadists to continue the fight against the "enemies of Islam" in Egypt and beyond. Al-Zawahiri argues that the struggle for Islamic rule in Egypt is part of a wider global battle between Muslims and non-Muslims. The veracity of the message has not been independently verified, but it comes at a time of renewed violence in Egypt. In recent months, there have been a spate of attacks on military and police targets in the Sinai peninsula, where a local affiliate of the Islamic State group has been active. Egyptian authorities have accused the Muslim Brotherhood, the political organization to which Morsi belonged, of being behind the attacks. The Brotherhood has denied these accusations, and there is no concrete evidence linking the group to the violence. Al-Zawahiri, who was born in Egypt, has been the leader of al-Qaeda since the death of Osama bin Laden in 2011. He is believed to be currently based in Afghanistan or Pakistan, and has been rumored to be in poor health in recent years.
