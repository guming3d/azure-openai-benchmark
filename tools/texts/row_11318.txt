Once named the most eligible girl in Britain by society bible Tatler, Lady Kitty Spencer's bachelorette days appear to be over, after going public with a new romance during a dinner at Lord's. And the lucky man isn't just any old beau: he's Nick Compton, England cricket star, and heir to a dynasty almost as exceptional as Kitty's own. Although this is the first time they have been seen together, the duo have been exchanging flirty Twitter messages since last September, with her teasing him for his obsession with his hair and laughingly calling him 'grandad' - a nod to the seven year age gap between them.

Compton, meanwhile, is the grandson of Denis Compton, who played 78 times for England, and landed an FA Cup winner's medal with Arsenal in 1950. One of England's top batsmen, Compton was named Cricketer of the Year by the Wisden Almanac - the cricket equivalent of Tatler - this year.

Although Compton isn't quite as well bred as his new girlfriend, the pair do at least have South Africa in common: he was born there and remained in the country until he won a scholarship to Harrow.

chatgpt: Nick Compton, a 29-year-old cricketer for England, has been caught up in a flirty messaging scandal with 22-year-old Kitty Spencer, first cousin to Prince William and Prince Harry. The messages were first exchanged back in September, and sources close to the pair say that things have been heating up between them ever since. Compton, who comes from a family of cricketing legends, including his grandfather Denis, has been known to charm the ladies with his dashing good looks and smooth talking. However, this latest scandal has left many questioning whether he has gone too far. Kitty Spencer, on the other hand, is no stranger to the spotlight. As a member of the royal family, she has grown up in the public eye and has become known for her impeccable style, grace and beauty. So, it's hardly surprising that she caught the eye of Compton, who is considered to be something of a heartthrob. According to insiders, the pair have been exchanging messages for months, with both parties seeming to enjoy the flirtatious banter. However, as time has gone on, it seems that things have started to heat up, with sources claiming that the two have even met up in secret. Some have questioned whether Compton's behaviour is befitting of an English cricketer, especially one who comes from such a celebrated family. However, others argue that he is simply a young man enjoying his life, and that there is no harm in a little harmless flirting. As for Kitty Spencer, she has remained tight-lipped about the whole affair, opting to focus on her blossoming career in fashion. However, rumours are already swirling that the royal family are less than impressed by the scandal, with many speculating that Prince William and Prince Harry have already voiced their displeasure. Despite the controversy, Compton remains one of England's most talented cricketers, and many hope that he will be able to put this incident behind him and focus on his game. Meanwhile, Kitty Spencer continues to make waves in the world of fashion, with her style and grace earning her fans around the world. Only time will tell what the future holds for these two young, charismatic and talented individuals. But for now, it seems that the world is watching closely as the saga unfolds.
