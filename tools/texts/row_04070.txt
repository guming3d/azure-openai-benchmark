It is perhaps not one of the most pressing fact finding missions she has been faced with. But with her tumbling locks of blonde hair, one could be forgiven for wondering how American astronaut Karen Nyberg keeps her long hair in such tip top condition while in space. Now, after she was faced with a barrage of questions asking just that, Ms Nyberg, a mechanical engineer aboard the Expedition 36 to the International Space Station, has given a step by step video demonstration.

Now, after she was faced with a barrage of questions asking just that, Ms Nyberg, a mechanical engineer aboard the Expedition 36 to the International Space Station, has given a step by step demonstration . She tweeted the video saying: 'I have had a LOT of questions about how I wash my hair in space! Let me show youâ€¦' She can be seen wrestling some water on to her scalp, battling with a few escaping bubbles. Then she adds leave-in shampoo which she works into her hair, which wafts and weaves around her head in the gravity free conditions. Her tools are then stuck to the wall beside her to prevent them from escaping and she towels her hair dry. She can be seen wrestling some water on to her scalp, battling with a few escaping bubbles.

She claims the results leave her hair feeling 'squeaky clean' Ms Nyberg said not a drop of water is wasted - as the water dries from her hair it is collected by the air conditioning system, which turns it into condensate and then into drinking water. Two astronauts left the International Space Station on Tuesday for a day of maintenance tasks, including installing a power cable needed for a new Russian laboratory due to be installed this year. Veteran NASA astronaut Christopher Cassidy and rookie partner Luca Parmitano, the first Italian to make a spacewalk, left the station's Quest airlock shortly after 8 am as the orbital outpost sailed about 260 miles (418 km) over the Arabian Sea.

chatgpt: Karen Nyberg, a female astronaut who recently spent six months in space aboard the International Space Station (ISS), has caught the media's attention for her innovative hair care routine. While many astronauts shave their heads to avoid the hassle of dealing with hair in zero gravity, Nyberg has managed to keep her long locks in tip-top condition using a unique combination of water, rinse-free shampoo, and some strategic combs. In a recently released video demonstration, Nyberg is seen grappling with a bottle of water, trying to carefully control the droplets to ensure they don't float away in the weightless environment. She then applies rinse-free shampoo to her hair, using a comb to massage it in and remove any dirt or sweat. Nyberg notes in the video that she gets asked about her hair "a lot," so she wanted to share her routine with the public. While Nyberg's hair care routine may seem frivolous on the surface, it actually serves as an important reminder of the challenges and innovations required for humans to survive in space. Weightlessness, for instance, can make it difficult to perform even basic tasks, like washing one's hair. Similarly, the lack of gravity means that sweat and dirt don't drip away from the body as they do on Earth, making personal hygiene a more complex affair. Nyberg's routine also highlights the importance of self-care and mental health in space. Astronauts who spend months or even years aboard the ISS are at risk of developing anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues due to the isolation and confinement of their environment. By taking care of her appearance and sharing her routine with others, Nyberg is promoting a sense of normalcy and self-expression in an otherwise sterile and unfamiliar setting. Nyberg, who is a mechanical engineer and mother of two, spent a total of 180 days in space during her most recent mission. She is also well-known for her artistic talents, having created a stunning quilt while in orbit that features images of the solar system, nebulae, and comets. Her hair care routine, though a seemingly small detail, serves as yet another example of the creativity and adaptability required for humans to thrive in the unique and demanding environment of space. Going forward, Nyberg's routine may inspire other astronauts to experiment with their own self-care practices and come up with new innovations that make life in space more comfortable and sustainable. As humanity continues to look towards the stars and explore new frontiers, it is important that we remember the human element of space travel and the ways in which astronauts must adapt to survive and thrive. Karen Nyberg's hair care routine is a reminder that even in the vacuum of space, the human spirit can find new and exciting ways to express itself.
