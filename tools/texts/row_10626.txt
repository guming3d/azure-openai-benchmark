article: (CNN) -- At 51 years of age, Polish prime minister Donald Tusk has come a long way. As part of the Kashubian minority living in the Gdansk Region, he was born to working-class parents -- his father a carpenter and his mother a nurse. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected in November 2007. As a student of History at the University of Gdansk in the late 1970s, a period of growing discontent with the Communist regime in Poland, he became actively involved in the creation of the opposition Students' Solidarity Committee. This was founded in reaction to the murder of student activist Stanislaw Pyjas by the State Security Service. Despite his anti-communist activities, he successfully finished his studies in 1980 and joined the Independent Solidarity Trade Union movement. When the Communists imposed martial law in 1981 he continued with his underground activities, writing pamphlets about the ideas of liberal economist Friedrich Hayek and the concept of private property. His heroes became former U.S. president Ronald Reagan and British prime minister Margaret Thatcher. With the fall of Communism in 1989, the Solidarity Movement splintered. Lech Walesa, the former Solidarity Leader was elected President, while Tusk went on to co-found the KLD (Liberal and Democratic Congress Party) with other well-known figures. The Party stood for among other things: free market economy, privatization, individual freedom of Polish citizens and Polish accession to the EU. The following year, during the 1991 Parliamentary elections, the KLD won 37 seats in the lower house of the Polish Parliament. Not being able to follow up on their success in the 1993 elections, the KLD merged with the larger Democratic Union Party (UD) to form a new party called Freedom Union (UW). Tusk soon became Deputy Chairman and in the 1997 elections, he was voted into the Senate. In 2001, Tusk formed the Civic Platform Party (PO), winning seats in that year's parliamentary elections and becoming Deputy Speaker in parliament. But the Civic Platform was not able to sustain its success in the 2005 elections. Tusk and his party lost both the presidential and parliamentary elections to Lech Kacczynski's PiS (Law and Justice Party). This setback was not to last as Tusk triumphed over Jaroslaw Kaczynsky's PiS in the October 2007 elections and became prime minister of Poland. Tusk's economic policies are pro-business: less bureaucratic hurdles and state interference making it easier for entrepreneurs to start businesses. He is also trying to woo back more than a million Poles who left the country to work in other European Union countries after it joined the EU in 2004. Tusk is a keen footballer, viewed in his youth as a promising striker. He is married to historian Malgorzata and has two children, Kasia and Michal.

chatgpt: Donald Tusk, the former Prime Minister of Poland, began his political journey as a student in Gdansk, where he was involved in anti-communist activities. He co-founded the Liberal and Democratic Congress Party (KLD) in 1989, which was later transformed into Civic Platform (PO). Tusk was instrumental in shaping the policies of the PO during his tenure as its leader, turning it into one of the most successful parties in Poland. In 1997, Tusk was elected to the Polish Senate for the first time. He quickly made a name for himself as an advocate for democratic reforms and social justice. Tusk's popularity and reputation as a reformist leader continued to grow over the years, and he emerged as one of the key players in the country's political landscape. Tusk's political ambitions reached new heights after the 1997 parliamentary election. He became the Prime Minister of Poland, leading a coalition government of the PO and other parties. Tusk's tenure as Prime Minister was marked by significant and positive changes in the country's political and economic landscape. Tusk's tenure as Prime Minister was also marked by his efforts to strengthen ties with the European Union. He was a vocal advocate for Poland's integration into the EU, and worked tirelessly to overcome the country's historical and cultural barriers to closer ties with the EU. Tusk's efforts paid off when Poland joined the EU in 2004. The move was celebrated as a historic moment in the country's history, and Tusk's leadership was credited with making it possible. Tusk's tenure as Prime Minister came to an end in 2014, when he was elected as the President of the European Council. In this new role, Tusk has continued to work for a stronger and more unified EU. He has been a key player in the ongoing Brexit negotiations, and has worked to strengthen ties between the EU and its member states. Throughout his political career, Tusk has been known for his commitment to democratic values, social justice, and European unity. His leadership has helped transform Poland into a modern democracy, and has had a profound impact on the country's political and economic landscape. As Tusk prepares to leave his current position as President of the European Council, many in Poland and across Europe are reflecting on his legacy. He will be remembered as a visionary leader who helped guide Poland through a period of significant change, and who worked tirelessly to build a stronger, more united Europe.
