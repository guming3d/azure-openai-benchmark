chatgpt: Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Ryan Braun, who was suspended for the entire 2013 season for violating the league's anti-drug policy, has tied the knot with his long-time girlfriend, model Larisa Fraser. The couple, who were engaged since 2013, finally exchanged their vows in a private ceremony in Malibu, California. According to sources, the wedding was an intimate affair that was attended by only close family and friends of the couple. The bride looked stunning in a white gown with a full train and lace sleeves, while the groom opted for a black tuxedo and a bow tie. The ceremony was followed by a lavish reception in a garden, where the newlyweds danced their first dance as a married couple. The couple's love story began more than a decade ago, when Braun and Fraser met each other at a charity event. Despite their busy schedules, the couple managed to spend quality time together and eventually fell in love. Braun has often credited Fraser for helping him overcome his personal struggles and guiding him through the tough times. However, Braun's career took a hit when he was suspended in 2013, after testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs. The suspension was a major blow to his career and reputation, but Braun remained determined to make a comeback, and did so successfully. He went on to earn three more All-Star selections and helped the Brewers reach the playoffs twice. Despite the turmoil, Fraser has always stood by her man and continued to support him. In an interview with People magazine, Braun opened up about the role Fraser played in his life and how much she has meant to him. "She's been my biggest supporter throughout my entire career, and especially through the tough times," he said. "I love her more than anything in the world." The wedding was a celebration not just of the couple's love, but also of their resilience and determination to overcome obstacles. It also marked a new chapter in their lives and a fresh start for Braun, who has often spoken about his desire to put the past behind him and move on. As for what the future holds, the couple has not revealed any immediate plans, but Braun has said that he hopes to continue playing baseball for as long as he can. "I still love the game, and I feel like I have a lot left to give," he said. "I'm excited for what the future holds and to see what we can accomplish together." In the meantime, the couple is simply enjoying their newlywed bliss and basking in their love for each other. It's a fairytale ending for a couple that has been through so much, and a reminder that true love can conquer all.
