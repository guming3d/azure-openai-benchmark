chatgpt: Former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has come under fire for attending the club's matches. However, one of United's former coaches, Phil Neville, has spoken out in defense of Ferguson. Last season, Neville served as a coach under David Moyes, who was fired in April after a string of lacklustre performances. Neville expressed his disagreement with the criticism of Ferguson, stating that the former manager should have spent even more time at Old Trafford. Ferguson's presence at United's matches has been a topic of debate since he retired in 2013 after 26 years in charge. Some have criticized him for attending matches and potentially interfering with the current manager's decisions. However, Neville argues that Ferguson's experience and presence can only benefit the current team. He points out that the former manager was responsible for building the club into the powerhouse it is today and that his insights could prove invaluable. United's new manager, Louis van Gaal, will lead the team into their upcoming match against Swansea on Saturday. The former Netherlands coach has already made his presence felt at Old Trafford, earning praise for his bold tactics and no-nonsense approach. Van Gaal faces the difficult task of improving United's fortunes after a disappointing season under Moyes. The team finished seventh in the Premier League, their worst showing in over two decades. Despite the challenges ahead, Neville is confident that United can bounce back under van Gaal's leadership. He praised the new manager's professionalism and experience, and said he was excited to see what the future holds for the team. "We have a great group of players and a fantastic manager - I think we're going to see some great things this season," Neville said. As United prepare to take on Swansea, fans will be eagerly watching to see if the team can live up to expectations. With van Gaal at the helm and Ferguson still a presence at Old Trafford, the club has the potential to once again become a dominant force in English football.
