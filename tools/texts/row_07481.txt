chatgpt: Football fans in the north of Brazil could snag tickets for as little as £9 on Viagogo for some of the World Cup matches this summer. Tickets for seeded teams Belgium and Uruguay were advertised for as little as £24, while face value tickets for group game matches ranged from £55 to £105. Despite the relatively low prices on secondary ticketing sites, stadiums in northern and north-eastern cities such as Manaus, Fortaleza, Cuiaba, and Salvador may still see plenty of empty seats. The World Cup is one of the biggest sporting events in the world, and demand for tickets is always high. However, with matches being held in more remote or less popular locations, it appears that some areas might struggle to fill their stadiums. This could be due to a number of reasons, but one possibility is the high cost of travel and accommodation. For example, the city of Manaus is located deep in the Amazon rainforest and is not easily accessible by car or train. It's likely that many football fans would have to fly to the city, and this can be quite expensive. Additionally, the cost of accommodation can also be high during the tournament, especially if demand is high. Despite some tickets being available for a fraction of their face value on sites like Viagogo, it remains to be seen whether these sales will have a significant impact on the number of empty seats in the stadiums. It's possible that local fans may not have the disposable income to attend the matches even with discounted prices, and it's also possible that some tickets may simply go unsold. However, for those who are able to attend the matches, the World Cup promises to be a fantastic event full of excitement and drama. With some of the world's best players on show and nations competing for the ultimate prize in football, there's sure to be plenty of action on the pitch. In conclusion, tickets for some World Cup matches in Brazil are being sold for a fraction of their face value on secondary ticketing sites like Viagogo. However, it remains to be seen whether this will be enough to fill the stadiums, especially in more remote or less popular locations. Nevertheless, for those able to attend, the World Cup promises to be an unforgettable experience.
