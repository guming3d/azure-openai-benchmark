The Australian singer, who launched her homeware design career in 2008 with a range of bed linen, has expressed her excitement over the new product release. In a recent statement, the "Can't Get You Out of My Head" hitmaker stated, "I'm thrilled to introduce drapes to the Kylie At Home range. It's always been a dream of mine to create beautiful and stylish homeware products that bring a touch of glamour to any home, and I believe these drapes will do just that."

However, it's Kylie's brand that has stood the test of time, becoming a staple name in the homeware industry. While Kylie's music career may have been put on hold due to the pandemic, her passion for interior design has continued to flourish, with the release of the new drapes further cementing her status as a style icon in the home decor world. The drapes are now available on the Kylie At Home website, with prices starting at $120 per panel. Whether you're a die-hard Kylie fan or just looking to add a touch of glamour to your interiors, these drapes are sure to impress.
