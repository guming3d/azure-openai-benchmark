article: Milton Keynes Dons' talented midfielder Dele Alli has been rewarded for his impressive start to the season by being handed the Football League Young Player of the Month award for August. The 19-year-old, who has been linked with moves to Liverpool and Bayern Munich, scored twice during the month, against Peterborough and Crawley, and has since continued his form with another goal at the start of September. Speaking to The Football League, Alli said of the award: 'I'm delighted, it's a good achievement but I couldn't do it without the team. It's a credit to be able to win this award in such a young team.' 'Without the manager giving me the opportunity and supporting me - I can't say thank you enough to him or the players.'

Alli's development at MK Dons was rewarded on Thursday, when he was given a contract extension until 2017. With plenty of admirers further up the league, it seems unlikely that Stadium MK will be his home for the duration, though. Brendan Rodgers is one manager keen on aquiring Alli's services, and the player is well aware of the interest. 'Before games, the gaffer will sit me down, tell me I'm being watched, and make sure I'm not getting carried away,' Alli told The Telegraph. 'I've heard he (Brendan Rodgers) has (been watching). It's not something I really worry about.' Alli's talent was shown to the wider world last month, when his performance against Manchester United in the Capital One Cup turned heads. Alli was part of the MK Dons team that defeated Manchester United 4-0 in the Capital One Cup . Alli scored two goals in the month of August, against Peterborough United and Crawley Town . MK Dons ran out comfortable 4-0 winners, and Alli admits that he enjoyed testing himself against top level oppostion. 'That game against United gave me great inspiration because that's where I want to be playing - in the top leagues against the top teams. 'It showed I am capable of doing that eventually.' For now though, Alli feels at home in Milton Keynes - the city in which he was born and raised - and will continue to impress until the big clubs come knocking. Alli looks happy to have received his award for Football League Young Player of the Month for August .

chatgpt: Tottenham midfielder Dele Alli has won the Football League Player of the Month award for August, following his impressive start to the season which has included two goals and a standout performance against Manchester United. The award covers all three of the Football League's divisions, making Alli's achievement all the more impressive, given the competition from more than 70 clubs across the country. Alli's form has also led to speculation over his future, with the 19-year-old reportedly attracting interest from Liverpool and Bayern Munich. However, Tottenham were quick to reward their rising star by extending his contract through to 2022.  Alli originally signed for Tottenham from MK Dons in 2015, but it was last season that he really burst onto the scene, scoring 10 goals in 33 Premier League appearances and helping Spurs push for a title challenge. This season, Alli has picked up where he left off, showcasing his ability to burst forward with the ball, his toughness in the tackle, and his eye for goal. His performance against Manchester United, in which he scored one goal and assisted another, was particularly impressive. Speaking after receiving the award, Alli said: "It's a great honour to win this award among such fantastic players. It's been a good start to the season for me and the team, and I hope we can keep it going. This award is great recognition for all the hard work we've put in." Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy was also pleased with Alli's achievement, saying: "We're delighted for Dele, who has had an outstanding start to the season. He's a player with huge potential and we're thrilled to have him at the club for the long term." Alli now has the opportunity to build on his early success and cement his place as one of the Premier League's brightest young talents. With Tottenham pushing for a title challenge once again this season, his contributions will be vital. As for the speculation over his future, Alli seems content to focus on his performances on the pitch for now. But with his contract extension and the praise he's receiving from all corners, it's clear that he's a player who's going places.
