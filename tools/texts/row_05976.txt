About 2,200 shop workers were laid off yesterday after JJB Sports became the latest high street retailer to collapse. The sports chain has been lurching from crisis to crisis over the past year, struggling with massive debts and low profits, as well as competition from rival Sports Direct and online retailers. It was forced to call in administrators who closed 133 stores after failing to find a buyer. One crisis too far: Around 2,200 shop workers were laid off after JJB Sports became the latest high street retailer to collapse . Sports Direct had been in talks to rescue the majority of the business, but accountants KMPG said it would buy only 20 stores, securing 550 jobs, and the website. Richard Fleming, of KPMG, said: ‘The level of cash ... required to rescue a more substantial part of the business was too much risk for most interested parties.’ Large high street chains have been bearing the brunt of the downturn, hurt by high rent bills, the rising cost of stock, and less cash coming through the tills as shoppers rein in their spending. Rival: Newcastle owner Mike Ashley's Sports Direct had been in talks to rescue the majority of JJB, but later said it would only buy 20 stores and the website . In July JJB’s chief executive Keith Jones stepped down after the company issued a string of warnings over profits and debts of £36million. It said it had approached its suppliers and partners for more cash, months after securing a deal aimed at shoring up the business. US retailer Dick’s Sporting Goods had thrown JJB a £20million lifeline which was supposed to last it until the end of the year. But in August JJB was forced to put itself up for sale in a desperate bid to avoid collapsing into administration. Kate Calvert, an analyst at investment bank Seymour Pierce, said at the time: ‘It’s a business that’s been shrinking for the last couple of years. ‘They haven’t been able to find their niche in the market place and be able to take on the likes of Sports Direct and online supermarkets.’ Mr Fleming said: ‘All staff made redundant as a result of store closures have had their arrears of wages and holiday entitlement paid in full. 'Our team of employment specialists will be supporting them and putting them in touch with job seekers’ services.’

chatgpt: In a shocking turn of events, a once-prestigious name in the sports retail industry has been plunged into administration. The company had a reputation for being one of the most trusted retailers of sports clothing and equipment in the market. However, things have taken a turn for the worse with the company falling victim to increased competition from Sports Direct and a mounting debt problem. Sources close to the company said that the firm had not managed to keep up with the pace of change in the industry, with other retailers promoting online shopping and investing heavily in digital marketing campaigns. These factors worked against the company, which struggled to stay afloat in the unforgiving retail environment. Additionally, the company was carrying a significant amount of debt, which made it even harder for the company to compete. Over time, the company found it harder to pay off its mounting debt obligations, which ultimately pushed the firm under. The news of the company's collapse has been met with shock and dismay by industry insiders and its loyal customers. Many have cited the firm's excellent customer service and reputation for quality as reasons for their continued patronage. However, even these factors were not enough to keep the company going in such a fiercely competitive market. The company’s financial turmoil had been evident for some time, with the retailer resorting to deep discounts in the hopes of clearing out inventory. Customers had been hoping that the company would recover, but it seems like this was not meant to be. Efforts to find a buyer to save the company from total collapse have been unsuccessful, and administrators have confirmed that all stores will be closed with immediate effect. With the closure of this chain, over 500 employees are facing significant uncertainty about their future. This is a developing story, and we will continue to provide updates as the situation evolves. It is a stark reminder of the harsh realities facing retailers today, with increased competition from bigger players and the rapid shift towards online shopping. For sports enthusiasts who have depended on the company for quality sporting equipment, this marks the end of an era. For the high street, it is a reminder that no retailer is immune to the difficult conditions that have plagued the sector in recent years.
