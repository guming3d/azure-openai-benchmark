article: By . Emma Innes . Salisbury District Hospital developed its own moisturising cream for patients recovering from burns . An NHS hospital has become the first in Britain to sell a product commercially in a bid to make money. Salisbury District Hospital, in Wiltshire, developed its own moisturising cream for patients recovering from skin grafts and burns. The hospital has used the sunflower oil-based product for 24 years, since it was created by staff in the hospital's pharmacy. It has proved so popular with patients since then, that the decision has been taken to sell it to the wider public. The lotion, which has now been given a lavender scent, is being called 'My Trusty Little Sunflower Cream' and will cost £6.99 per tube. Profits from the sales will be reinvested in patient care. The cream works by replacing the skin's essential fatty acids which improves its texture. Currently, 20,000 tubes have been manufactured and the cream is available through the hospital's website. A spokeswoman for the hospital said the cream, which . contains five per cent sunflower oil, was an alternative to expensive . beauty creams. It has also not been tested on animals and does not . contain perfume. Malcolm Cassells, finance director for the Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust, said tens of thousands of pounds had already been invested in the product. He said: ‘I would be disappointed if we hadn't recuperated our costs within the next couple of months. The hospital has used the sunflower oil-based product for 24 years and it has proved so popular with patients they have decided to sell it to the wider public . All profits from the sales will be reinvested in patient care . ‘We've invested in PR and marketing . advisers to take us through the process as well as manufacturing quite a . large number of tubes ready for the launch.’ He added: ‘We don't claim clinical . properties for this cream, we claim it only as a moisturiser but we know . this product is really good. ‘It . has been popular with patients ever since we invented it and many have . asked to have it available for purchase after their discharge.’ A hospital spokeswoman said: ‘We just thought the time was right for it to be released.’ A spokesman for the Department of Health said the cream was the first commercial venture by an NHS hospital as far as they were aware.

chatgpt: Salisbury District Hospital has taken the initiative to create their own moisturising cream, specifically designed for patients who have undergone skin grafts or suffered from burn injuries. The cream has been tailored to meet the unique needs of these patients, providing the necessary hydration and nourishment to facilitate a speedy recovery.  The cream has been made commercially available in £6.99 tubes, with all profits being reinvested back into patient care. The endeavor is being lauded as a groundbreaking move, promoting greater self-sufficiency within the NHS and driving innovation.  The Department of Health has confirmed that Salisbury District Hospital is the first NHS Trust to make money from such a scheme. This is a significant achievement, as the hospital is not only providing top-notch care to its patients, but also generating revenue to further support its mission.  Dr. Carly Atkinson, a dermatologist at the hospital, spearheaded the project. She noted, "We noticed that our patients were struggling to find the right products on the market, and many were experiencing negative side effects which were delaying their recovery."  Dr. Atkinson and her team of specialists collaborated with pharmacists to develop a cream that was both effective and safe for patients to use. The formulation includes natural ingredients such as shea butter and coconut oil, and has been rigorously tested to ensure that it is non-toxic and non-irritating.  The cream has received overwhelming positive feedback from patients, who have reported that it has helped to alleviate discomfort, reduce scarring, and improve overall skin health.  Salisbury District Hospital's innovative approach has garnered attention from other healthcare providers and NHS Trusts across the country. Many are now looking to replicate the hospital's model, hoping to develop their own products and generate revenue for patient care.  The hospital has plans to expand its product line, with the aim of developing additional creams and skincare products to meet the needs of different patient groups.  Overall, Salisbury District Hospital's moisturising cream is a remarkable achievement, showcasing the power of collaboration and innovation within the healthcare industry. By taking charge of their own patient care needs, hospitals and healthcare providers can not only improve the quality of care they provide, but also generate much-needed revenue to support their mission. This is a trend that we can only hope will continue to grow within the NHS and beyond.
