article: A developer who mistakenly built a $1.8 million waterfront house on parkland in Rhode Island has been ordered to remove it. The Rhode Island Supreme Court found that the Narragansett home was built entirely on land owned by the Rose Nulman Park Foundation, and therefore must be removed. The developer, Robert C Lamoureux and his company Four Twenty Corp., began building the home in 2009, but it didn't discover the error until 2011. It argued it should not be penalized for an innocent surveying mistake. Parkland: This Rhode Island house was built on lands dedicated to recreation and contemplation . Secluded: The house sits in a prime ocean-front position surrounded by uninhabited land on one side and the sea on the other . The court said the park's property rights outweighed that. The three-storey house on Point Judith has water views from Newport to Watch Hill and a rooftop cabana with a Jacuzzi and a wet bar and was completed in January 2011. The luxurious three-bedroom home looks to be the ideal seaside idyll, but has remained uninhabited after a potential buyer conducted a survery and found that the home sits squarely on public parkland. James E. Kelleher, Lamoureaux's lawyer, asked the court to allow his client to pay for the land or trade it for other waterfront property instead of removing the home, reports the Providence Journal. He told the court, 'The harm to my client is $1.7 million.' Luxurious: The home has a wet bar, wraparound balcony and rooftop Jacuzzi - but it's never been inhabited, after a potential buyer found that it had been built on a site dedicated to parklands . Demolish or remove: A court has ruled that the house must go - it's unclear whether it will be demolished or moved to another site . The judge asked why the Rose Nulman Park should give up six per cent of its land to Lamoureux when it had done nothing wrong. Kelleher argued that Lamoureux hadn't done anything wrong either, and was a victim of a surveying mistake. He said Lamoureux had paid an engineering firm thousands of dollars to survey the land and was 'utterly shocked' to discover that the actual site of the house had never been surveyed. Saul Nulman, a New York City businessman, bought land at Point Judith in 1993 and trasferred the land to the foundation in 2006 before he died. The land is dedicated to his mother, Rose Nulman, to be a place of recreation and contemplation. Foundation lawyer Mark Freel says it's not known whether the unoccupied house can be moved or will have to be torn down. He says the house has been there for a long time already, and it's time for it to go.

chatgpt: Rhode Island Supreme Court has ordered the removal of a luxurious three-story house from a site in the wake of a legal dispute between the developer and the park foundation. The house was built by Robert C Lamoureux and his company Four Twenty Corp in the year 2011. The verdict came after it was found that the house was built on land owned by the Rose Nulman Park Foundation. The foundation was given the responsibility of ensuring that the land is used only for recreational and contemplation purposes. The land was purchased by the late Saul Nulman in 1993 and was dedicated to his mother. The park foundation alleged that Lamoureux and his company illegally constructed the house on the land and demanded its removal. A potential buyer interested in the property conducted a survey and discovered that the house sits on the foundation's land. The finding led to the legal battle in court. The Rhode Island Supreme Court supported the argument of the park foundation and ordered the removal of the house from the site. "While we recognize that the construction of a luxurious house is an investment and takes considerable effort, we cannot overlook the fact that the land on which this house was built has a specific purpose," stated the Supreme Court's verdict. The court's decision has left the fate of the house uncertain. It is unclear whether the house will be moved to another site or demolished altogether. However, it is expected that the developer will have to bear the cost of relocation or demolition if any such decision is taken by the authorities. The construction of the house on a land dedicated to recreation and contemplation has raised questions about the legality and responsibility of developers. The incident has put pressure on the authorities to tighten regulations and ensure accountability on the part of the developers. The Rose Nulman Park Foundation has welcomed the verdict and has called for stricter regulations in the future. "We are happy with the verdict, and we hope this sends a clear message to the developers that they cannot take the land for granted," said a spokesperson for the foundation. The case has also highlighted the importance of conducting proper surveys and due diligence before making any investment in property. It can help avoid legal battles like this and prevent unnecessary loss of time and resources. In conclusion, the Rhode Island Supreme Court's verdict on the removal of the luxurious three-story house built on the Rose Nulman Park Foundation's land has sent a message to developers to respect the designated usage of land. The legal dispute has raised questions about the responsibility of developers and the need for tighter regulations to prevent such incidents in the future.
