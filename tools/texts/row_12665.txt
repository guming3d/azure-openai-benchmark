However, the emblem has already become the subject of ridicule on Twitter, with users poking fun at its design. Various adaptations of the emblem have surfaced online, featuring shavers, Finding Nemo, aliens and even Marge Simpson.

He stated that the emblem is "modern, vibrant and innovative, and perfectly depicts Russia's personality and style." The emblem features a red, blue and gold design, which includes a football and a firebird, a symbol of Russian folklore. The emblem also incorporates elements of traditional Russian art. The unveiling of the World Cup emblem is a highly anticipated event for fans, with past emblem designs being celebrated and critiqued.

As social media users continue to poke fun at the World Cup emblem, time will tell whether it will become a beloved symbol of the competition or a source of ridicule for years to come.
