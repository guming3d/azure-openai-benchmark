article: By . Darren Boyle . This is the terrible moment a horse was seriously injured during a bullfight after it was gored by the rampaging animal. As the bull charged, the matador tried to stab it in the back with a spear but the bull continued its run, dropped its head and hit it in the barrel. The matador tried to hang on to his horse as the animal fell onto its side. The horse reared up, and was struck a second and a third time by the bull which had to be lured away from the scene. The shocking incident happened at the Corrida de Toros in Valencia, Spain. However, on this occasion, the picador was too slow allowing the bull a side-on attack. Fans paid between €12 and €120 to attend the show. Luckily, the horse was saved from serious injury and limped from the stadium after its ordeal. Bullfighting has been banned around Barcelona and has reduced in popularity in recent years. A recent opinion poll found that almost three quarters of Spanish people dislike the sport.

chatgpt: In a recent event that took place in Valencia, Spain, spectators of a traditional bullfight were left horrified as a picador failed to stop the bull from attacking a blindfolded horse. Fans paid up to €120 to witness the spectacle, which involved the picador riding the horse while attempting to weaken the bull with a lance. However, things didn't go as planned as the bull charged towards the horse, knocking it firmly on its side, causing it to collapse on the sand. The picador, fearing for his safety, jumped to safety, leaving the injured horse to face the bull's continued attack. The animal was eventually distracted, allowing the severely wounded horse to be coaxed off the sand and led away from the arena. According to reports, the horse was limping heavily and appeared to have undergone a significant amount of trauma. The incident sparked outrage among animal rights activists, who have been campaigning for an end to bullfighting for years. As per them, this latest incident serves as a stark reminder of the dangers and brutality of this 'sport,' not just for the bulls but also for the horses that are forced to participate. In Spain, bullfighting is considered a cultural heritage, and many locals continue to view it as an essential part of their traditional festivities. However, the sport has been criticized for years as it involves brutalizing animals, both physically and emotionally. According to the Humane Society International, bullfighting claims the lives of around 250,000 bulls per year, and countless horses and dogs are also used in the performances. Animal rights campaigners are now demanding stricter regulations to be put in place to protect the animals used in these events. Along with better animal welfare provisions, they're suggesting a complete ban on the use of horses, as they often bear the brunt of the bulls' attacks, leading to unnecessary risks and injuries. Despite the criticism and growing opposition worldwide, bullfighting continues to thrive in certain parts of Spain, with events still taking place regularly in Valencia and other regions. However, as more and more people become aware of the brutality of these events, the calls for a ban on bullfighting are only getting louder. In conclusion, the shocking incident in Valencia should serve as a wakeup call for those that wish to defend this 'sport.' While it may be an essential part of Spain's cultural heritage, it's time to accept a more compassionate approach to tradition, one that doesn't involve the suffering and death of animals.
