article: LONDON, England (CNN) -- More than six hundred workers at Total's Lindsey oil refinery in Northern England have been told they no longer have jobs after staging what the company calls an "unofficial, illegal walk out." Protesters gathered outside Total's Lindsey oil refinery on Friday, June 19, after hundreds of striking workers were sacked. The steel workers started striking last Thursday after one contractor axed 51 jobs while another employer on the same site was recruiting. Protesters gathered outside Total's Lindsey oil refinery Friday with placards calling for solidarity from fellow workers. The dispute has prompted a number of wildcat strikes at power stations and oil refineries around the United Kingdom. The workers' union GMB, which represents around half of the sacked workers, estimates that, as of late yesterday, up to 4,000 other workers at four power stations and three oil refineries had walked off the job in sympathy. Early this afternoon, Total confirmed that negotiations had started between the workers' employers and ACAS, the British Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service. Earlier, in a statement posted on its Web site, Total announced that its contractors had started the process of ending employment contracts for 647 workers on the HDS-3 construction project. The statement said the project has been temporarily shut down and that all employees had until 5pm on Monday to reapply for their jobs. Phil Davies, national secretary and head of the manufacturing section at the GMB Union, told CNN the invitation to a job interview would only stoke workers' anger. "I think that would just humiliate people to be quite honest and it will put their backs up and make them more determined to win it," he said. He said union representatives were in the process of gathering information to hold an official industrial ballot, a process that could take six weeks. The British Press Association published one sacked Lindsey worker's appeal for support from fellow union members: "We are asking for support from workers across the country which I am sure will be given. Total will soon realize they have unleashed a monster." Workers at the Lindsey oil refinery walked off the job for more than one week in early February to protest against the hiring of hundreds of foreign workers. They returned to work after the unions and the company gave assurances that half the jobs would go to British workers.

chatgpt: A dispute between Total, the French oil company, and hundreds of its striking employees has deepened after the striking workers were told they would have to reapply for their jobs. The conflict began when Total made 51 workers redundant, while another company was reportedly hiring. Now, negotiations are taking place between the striking workers’ employers and the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS). The strike has already led to walkouts at four power stations and three refineries in the UK, with Total’s Lindsey Oil Refinery in Lincolnshire among the affected sites. The strikes have caused supply chain disruption and concern that fuel supplies could run low in the coming days. Total has rejected calls to halt the job cuts, arguing that they are necessary due to weak demand for fuels and low refining margins. However, the striking workers have accused the company of outsourcing jobs to foreign workers who are willing to work for less money. Meanwhile, the UK government has urged both sides to engage in constructive dialogue and reach a resolution before the situation spirals out of control. “We are aware of the situation at Total and passed on our concerns to both the company and the unions,” said a spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. The strikes come at a time of heightened tension between workers and their employers in the UK. Earlier this year, there were walkouts by Post Office employees over job losses and changes to their pensions, and a threatened strike by workers at the Rolls-Royce factory in Derby over proposed cuts to the pension scheme. The conflict at Total is also taking place against a backdrop of rising unemployment in the UK, as the country grapples with the economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic. The latest official figures show that the UK’s unemployment rate rose to 4.9% in the three months to October, up from 4.5% a year earlier. The dispute at Total is likely to continue unless the workers’ employers and ACAS can reach a compromise. Total has warned that it may seek an injunction to prevent further disruption to its operations, while the striking workers are planning further walkouts unless their demands are met. The situation is fast-moving and complex, and both sides are keen to avoid a lengthy dispute that could lead to further unrest in the UK’s energy sector. Whether or not a resolution can be reached in the coming days remains to be seen, but what is clear is that the dispute at Total has significant implications for the UK’s energy industry and its wider economy.
