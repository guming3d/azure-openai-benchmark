However, Fifa said the official figure of those in attendance was 68,351. Meanwhile, those watching at home spotted hundreds of empty seats during the Spain Netherlands match on Friday and England versus Italy on Saturday. With just hours to go before the Argentina and Bosnia Herzegovina kick-off on Sunday night at the Maracana stadium, tickets were still available online priced at £80. Tickets to see Bosnia Herzegovina play Iran in Salvador next week which cost £110 remain largely unsold.

Those watching at home spotted hundreds of empty seats during the Spain v Netherlands match on Friday . A Fifa spokesman told The Independent that a total of 2.9 million tournament tickets had been allocated with only 9,327 remaining. However, large numbers of tickets distributed to Football Associations around the world often go unsold. England is believed to have sold all 2,500 of its official allocation of tickets for the Saturday game while Italy were only reported to have sold 200 of theirs and so returned the rest. Last week it emerged that more than 1,000 fans were forced to switch seats after stadium building delays and changes to signage compelled a reconfigurement of some seating plans. Emails were sent to 1,376 fans telling them to exchange their tickets for others of the same category but in a different section of several of the 12 tournament stadiums. A FIFA media spokesman said that officials had contacted ticketholders in advance to prevent confusion or delays on match days and that the changes affected only a tiny proportion of the tickets sold. Protesters have been staging demonstrations against Brazil spending £7billion of public money on the tournament.

chatgpt: On Sunday, Switzerland and Ecuador faced off in the Arena Brasilia for the opening game of Group E of the 2014 FIFA World Cup. The stadium, with a capacity of 72,500 people, was expected to be packed with enthusiastic fans cheering on their teams. However, it appeared only two-thirds full during the game, with hundreds of empty seats sighted by viewers. The stadium, which was completed in 1974, underwent renovations for the World Cup, including the installation of 288 new seats and an additional 19 television cameras. Despite this, it seems that ticket sales for the game were not as successful as expected. This isn't the first time that the Arena Brasilia has been plagued by empty seats during the World Cup. During the Spain-Netherlands match on Friday, many fans were shocked to see large sections of the stadium empty. This sparked controversy among fans who claimed that the empty seats were being held by FIFA and corporate sponsors, but not being used. Aside from the Arena Brasilia, other stadiums are also experiencing difficulty in selling tickets. A large number of tickets for the Bosnia-Herzegovina vs Iran match, set to take place on Wednesday at the Arena Fonte Nova in Salvador, remain unsold.  FIFA has stated that poor ticket sales may be due to a combination of factors, including high prices and concerns over the country's ability to handle the large influx of tourists. The high cost of travel and accommodations in Brazil may also be a factor. Despite the empty seats, the Switzerland vs Ecuador game was exciting and closely contested. Switzerland managed to secure a 2-1 victory over Ecuador, despite trailing early on. Haris Seferovic scored the winning goal for Switzerland deep into stoppage time, sending Swiss fans into a frenzy. The win was a huge boost for Switzerland, who are considered one of the underdogs of the tournament. They will be looking to continue their winning ways when they face off against France on Friday. Ecuador will be hoping to bounce back from their loss when they take on Honduras on Friday as well. Overall, the World Cup has been an exciting event so far, with many memorable matches and outstanding performances. Despite the struggles with ticket sales, the passion and energy of the fans in attendance have made for a truly memorable tournament.
