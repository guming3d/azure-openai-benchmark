article: Mexico City (CNN) -- The United Nations' cultural organization recognized mariachi music Sunday in a move that Mexican authorities hope will help preserve the well-known tradition. The songs -- often played on festive occasions by groups of guitar, violin and trumpet performers wearing traditional clothes or wide-brimmed hats -- are sung throughout Mexico, and have become a key part of regional identity, officials said. "The community and the family hand down musically their knowledge, history and the pleasure of singing to the nature surrounding them. They consider it their own," Mexican officials said in their application to the United Nations Organization for Education, Science and Culture (UNESCO), which added mariachi music to the organization's list of intangible cultural patrimony Sunday. Putting mariachi on the list could increase awareness of the music, UNESCO said in a statement Sunday. "Learning by ear is the main means of transmission of traditional Mariachi, and the skill is usually passed down from fathers to sons and through performance at festive, religious and civil events," the statement said. Mexico's application notes that the music "has crossed borders and become a symbol of Mexico." "Immigrants, descendants of Mexicans living abroad, as well as Latin Americans, have made the modern mariachi a symbol of community identity, because it is a bond linking them to their roots in spite of the distance," the application says. Jorge Aquino, director of the Mexican Music School in Mexico City, told CNNMexico.com last year that the music has evolved over time, and also drawn greater international attention. "Now including in foreign countries like the United States, Japan and Colombia, there are mariachi schools, mariachi classes, mariachi degrees," he said. Many of Mexico's monuments have already been honored by the United Nations' cultural organization. Last year UNESCO added traditional Mexican food to its intangible cultural patrimony list. In 2008, the organization recognized Mexico's traditional Day of the Dead celebration. This year UNESCO also added 13 other items to its list, including Chinese shadow puppetry, a ritual of transplanting rice in Hiroshima, Japan, and "poetic dueling" in Cyprus.

chatgpt: UNESCO officials have officially decided to recognize and honor mariachi music, adding it to the organization's list of Intangible Cultural Heritage. The announcement came after a long campaign to recognize the importance of mariachi music, which has become an iconic part of Mexico's cultural heritage. The Mexican government praised the decision, stating that mariachi music "has crossed borders" and has become a national symbol of Mexico and its people. In addition, the government pointed out that mariachi music has been a source of comfort for millions of immigrants living abroad, helping them stay connected to their homeland and to their families back home. Mariachi music is a style of music that originated in the western Mexican state of Jalisco in the late 19th century. It is typically played by a band of musicians dressed in distinctive outfits, including sombreros and embroidered charro jackets. The music is characterized by its use of traditional Mexican instruments, including the violin, trumpet, guitarr√≥n, and vihuela. This decision by UNESCO follows previous recognition of Mexican cuisine and many of the country's monuments as part of the world's shared cultural heritage. Mexican cuisine was added to the list in 2010, and UNESCO has since recognized several iconic dishes, including tacos, tortillas, and chiles. The decision to honor mariachi music has been praised by many in Mexico and abroad. Supporters of the decision note that mariachi music represents a unique aspect of Mexican culture that has had a profound impact on music and culture around the world. The unique blend of influences from indigenous Mexican music, Spanish music, and African rhythms have led mariachi music to become one of Mexico's most recognizable cultural exports. In addition to its cultural importance, mariachi music has also been recognized for its contribution to communities in Mexico and abroad. The official UNESCO announcement highlighted the important role that mariachi music plays in social gatherings and celebrations, acknowledging its ability to bring people together and create a sense of community. Overall, the decision to honor mariachi music as part of the world's shared cultural heritage is a tribute to the unique style and enduring legacy of this important cultural artifact. It serves as a reminder of the importance of recognizing and preserving cultural heritage around the world, and the role that music can play in bringing people together and celebrating the rich diversity of our shared human experience.
