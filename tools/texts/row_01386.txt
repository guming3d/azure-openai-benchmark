These incredible photos have captured the moment a hungry bird almost drops its dinner, but successfully catches it again mid-air . After being snatched from the water the carp almost escapes the beak of the hungry tern bird as they both soar through the air . As it's on the cusp of freedom, it is back inside the bird's mouth within moments . But as it's on the cusp of freedom, it is back inside the bird's mouth within moments. The struggle was caught on camera by American photographer Andrew Lee, 52, of Irvine, California. He spotted a flock of caspian terns hunting for food close to his Californian home. 'I spotted several terns circling around a particular area of the lake,' says Mr Lee. 'I followed one of them with my camera and suddenly the tern dived into the lake and came up with a big carp. 'I kept following the bird as it flew up with this fish thrashing wildly in his beak. 'The fish was able to break free and for a split second it looked like it was flying through the air, pursued by the tern - it was a precious moment.' Mr Lee was able to watch from just 60 metres away as the struggle took place. Spending only ten seconds flying through the air, the carp almost completes his great escape, before he is caught by the tern at the last moment. The bird continues his journey with the fish securely in his beak . Mr Lee says: 'The tern had a hard time trying to stay in the air as they fish was obviously very heavy for him to try and control. 'He tried to flip the fish over so he could swallow it, head first, and I happened to capture the moment when the fish was flying in the air. 'Most people, including myself, have never seen a flying fish with a tern in hot pursuit behind. 'We were all surprised to see how big the fish was in relation to the tern. 'It was a very special moment to capture and to share, and I would like to share with others the wonders of our beautiful world.'

The photos captured show a bird fiercely holding onto a small animal, which appears to be on the brink of freedom, yet suddenly, it is back inside the bird's mouth. Various theories about the animal's identity range from being a fish or another bird, but regardless of what exactly it is, the bird's determination to keep it inside its mouth is truly fascinating. It is clear that the bird is fighting with all its might to keep its prey from escaping, even in the face of potential danger. As these photos have gone viral across social media, many animal experts have weighed in on the behavior of the bird, suggesting that this is simply an example of natural behavior exhibited by birds of prey. Such birds are known for their skill and instinct in hunting and capturing prey. Furthermore, they have evolved over the years to become incredibly efficient hunters. Even though this behavior may seem cruel, it is actually necessary for birds to hunt and eat other animals in order to survive. In fact, experts say that the bird's determination to keep hold of its prey is evidence of just how important this meal is to its survival. It seems that the small animal, while it may have been close to freedom, was not able to escape the bird's grasp. The photos themselves are quite stunning, capturing a moment in time that is both eerie and dramatic. The bird's powerful beak and piercing eyes are on full display, and its grip on the animal is unrelenting. It is clear that this bird is not going to let go of its meal without a fight, even if it means putting itself in harm's way.
