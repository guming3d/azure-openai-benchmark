Asked if he could win his fourth title as Arsenal boss before his contract expires in 2017, Wenger said: ‘Of course.

We have to fight like mad now to come back as much as possible to show that we can compete in every single game.’ Arsenal have gone 10 years since they last won the Premier League, but claimed their first silverware since 2005 after winning the FA Cup last year.

chatgpt: Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has expressed his confidence that the Gunners will be crowned champions again, despite their struggles during the current season. The team remains 13 points adrift of current Premier League leaders Chelsea, but Wenger believes that they have what it takes to challenge for the title.  Wenger has been in charge of Arsenal since 1996 and has led the team to three Premier League titles during his tenure. Speaking to reporters ahead of their Wednesday night clash against Southampton, Wenger said, "We have everything in place to challenge for the title. We have experienced players who know what it takes to win, and I believe we can do it again." Arsenal have had a mixed season so far, with inconsistent form and injuries to key players such as Hector Bellerin, Santi Cazorla, and Danny Welbeck hindering their progress. However, the Gunners have won their last three league matches and will be looking to continue that momentum against Southampton. "We are on a good run of form and we know that every game is crucial in our bid to climb up the table," Wenger added. "We have to take it one game at a time and focus on our performance against Southampton. If we can maintain our current form and stay injury-free, we can definitely push for the title." One of the key factors in Arsenal's success this season will be the form of star striker Alexis Sanchez. The Chilean has been in outstanding form so far, scoring 13 goals in the Premier League and providing six assists. Sanchez has been linked with a move away from Arsenal in the summer, but Wenger remains confident of keeping him at the club. "He is a vital player for us and we want him to stay," Wenger said. "He has shown his quality time and time again and we need him to maintain that level of performance if we are to challenge for the title." Arsenal will have a tough task ahead of them as they take on Southampton at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday night. The Saints have proved to be a difficult opponent for Arsenal in recent years, with the last three meetings between the two sides ending in draws. However, Wenger will be hoping that his players can rise to the challenge and claim all three points. If Arsenal are to mount a serious title challenge this season, they must continue to pick up points against teams lower in the table. The Gunners will also be boosted by the return of midfielder Granit Xhaka, who has completed his four-match suspension. Xhaka has been a key player for Arsenal this season, providing a solid presence in midfield and contributing two goals. Overall, Wenger's optimism and confidence in his team's ability to compete for the Premier League title has given Arsenal fans something to cheer about. Whether they can close the gap on Chelsea and mount a serious challenge remains to be seen, but this team has the talent and experience to do just that.
