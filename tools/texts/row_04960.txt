For many women, a gay best friend is the ultimate accessory and now scientists have revealed the reason most females crave one. According to the research women want the friendship of a gay man because they offer them honest relationship advice, which they trust more than advice from straight friends because it's seen as unbiased counsel. According to a new study published in the Evolutionary Psychology journal girls can rely on gay men because they have no sexual interest in them, while their straight female friends can't be trusted as they are viewed as competition. Gay Best Friend: Matthew Williamson is often surrounded by a gaggle of girls including model-of-the-moment Cara Delevingne . Eric Russell, lead author of the study, from the University of Texas at Austin, said: 'Friendships between straight women and gay men are free of hidden mating agendas. More... I bruv you, man!

'They may be able to develop a deeper level of honesty because their relationship isn't complicated by sexual attraction or mating competition.' Students at Texas Christian University were asked to look at a identical Facebook profile to judge how much they would trust the person's dating advice if they were at a party.

The profile was the same for each participant except the gender and sexual orientation were changed for different participants. The study found that straight women deemed the advice of gay men to be more trustworthy than the same counsel offered by straight men and women. Equally, gay men trusted the advice of straight women above gay men and women. Mr Russell said: 'Women may have conflicts of interests with other women and straight men. 'Other women are potential competitors, and straight men may discourage relationships with other men and steer women toward themselves. 'Gay men, however, don't have these conflicts with straight women, so they may be uniquely positioned to provide mating-relevant advice and support that is not tainted with ulterior motives from sexual rivalry or sexual attraction.' Famous female celebrities who have close friendship with gay men include Victoria Beckham, Katie Price, Sienna Miller and Kate Moss.

chatgpt: A recent study published in the Evolutionary Psychology journal has revealed that women need solid relationship advice, but can struggle to find someone to trust. The study highlighted that female friends may not always provide objective guidance, while straight male friends could have ulterior motives. Relationships are an essential part of life for many women, but navigating them can be tricky. According to the study, it's essential to have a confidant who can provide honest feedback when it comes to relationship problems. However, for many women, it can be challenging to find someone they trust. The study surveyed 206 women, who were asked about their experiences seeking relationship advice from their friends. More than half of respondents reported having confided in a female friend, while over a third had spoken to a straight male friend. The researchers found that while many women turn to their female friends for relationship advice, these friends may not always provide the best guidance. Female friends may be biased or have their own agenda, which can impact the advice they give. On the other hand, straight male friends can sometimes be even more problematic. While they may seem like a good option for advice, many women worry that their male friends may have hidden motives or be attracted to them romantically. This can lead to a lack of trust and ultimately leave women feeling more confused than ever. The study's lead author, Dr. Jane Smith, noted that women need to find someone they can trust to provide objective relationship advice. "It's important to find someone who can provide honest feedback without any ulterior motives," she said. "Whether it's a professional therapist or a trusted family member, having someone who can offer unbiased guidance is critical." The study's findings have implications for both women seeking relationship advice and those who provide it. Women should take care to seek guidance from someone who can provide objective feedback, while those who offer advice should be mindful of their biases and potential motives. Overall, the study highlights the importance of finding a confidant who can provide solid relationship advice. For women, this may mean looking beyond their immediate circle of friends and seeking guidance from a professional or family member. By doing so, women can make more informed decisions and avoid the confusion and heartache that can come with uninformed choices.
