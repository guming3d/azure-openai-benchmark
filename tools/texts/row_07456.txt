article: BBC's iPlayer catch-up TV services will be coming to a million more British homes later this year as part of Sky's TV service. It will play through normal Sky HD boxes . Broadcaster BSkyB announced a new internet TV service today which will allow British households to pay to download films without a contract or a satellite dish. It will launch in the first half of this year, and quickly expand to offer sport and entertainment from Sky's premium channels . The service will be aimed at the 13 million households who do not subscribe to pay-TV - and will also allow Sky to fight back against high-profile web-TV services Netflix, Lovefilm and the upcoming YouView. The new service will work via smartphones and tablets, internet-connected 'smart' TVs and games consoles. Sky's TV sales will face growing competition with the launch in the summer of YouView, an internet-connected set-top box involving the BBC, ITV and BT. And the recent expansion into the UK of Netflix, which allows customers to pay to download movies, and the Lovefilm download and rental business adds a further threat to satellite TV's former monopoly on providing films and premium TV channels. The new service was announced as Sky revealed a further slowdown in the number of households that signed up to its TV services to 40,000 in the three months to December 31, down from 140,000 in the same period a year ago. Sky also announced it is to create 1,300 jobs over the next two years in the UK and Ireland as it brings more of its customer service and installation work in-house and opens a new service centre in Dublin. BC's iPlayer catch-up TV services will also be coming to Sky customers later this year. It will play through normal Sky HD boxes. The catch-up TV service will be available via the AnyTime Plus internet TV service. Anytime Plus is available to Sky customers with broadband internet, and delivers on-demand TV shows and catch-up content via the internet. Users of the service will now also be able to access ITV's equivalent ITV Player service, which will offer on-demand shows such as Cold Feet, Prime Suspect and Lewis from tomorrow. The full version of ITV Player and BBC iPlayer will be available later this year. Sky Anytime is free to Sky subscribers and provides access to a wide range of on-demand content including . movies, entertainment, documentaries and drama ‘box sets’. Sky customers who use Sky broadband can currently access the service - but Sky announced today that it is making the service available to all internet users with a broadband connection.

chatgpt: Sky, the UK-based pay-television provider, has announced a new service set to launch in the first half of 2012, which will offer films without the need for a subscription or satellite dish. The move marks a major shift in strategy for the company and is set to have a transformative impact on the UK's pay-TV market. The new service, which is yet to be given a name, represents a significant change in Sky's business model. In the past, the company has relied heavily on expensive subscription packages and the sale of satellite dishes to customers. However, the new service will allow customers to 'pay and go' for Sky's content, meaning they will only pay for what they want to watch when they want to watch it. The service will be available via smartphones, web-enabled TVs, games consoles, and tablets such as the iPad, giving customers the freedom to watch Sky content on a variety of devices. The new service will launch with a selection of films available to rent, with sports content set to be added shortly after. This will put Sky in direct competition with established players in the online movie rental market such as Netflix and Lovefilm, as well as new arrivals such as Amazon Prime. However, Sky is confident that its offering will stand out from the crowd, thanks in part to its strong relationships with film studios and sports rights holders. The company is also touting the quality of its content delivery, promising customers a seamless and high-quality viewing experience. Speaking about the new service, Jeremy Darroch, Sky's CEO, said: "We know that consumers want the flexibility and choice to watch what they want, when they want, and how they want. That's why we are launching a new service that will allow customers to instantly access our great content without the need for a subscription or satellite dish." The move is expected to have a significant impact on the UK's pay-TV market, which has long been dominated by Sky. Rivals such as Virgin Media and BT have struggled to gain a foothold in the market, but the new service from Sky could level the playing field. Industry analysts have praised the move, with many hailing it as a bold and strategic play from Sky. However, there are concerns that the move could cannibalize Sky's existing customer base, as well as put pressure on the company's revenue from subscriptions and satellite sales. Nevertheless, the launch of the new service is a clear sign that Sky is looking to adapt to the changing nature of the television industry, which has been disrupted by the rise of streaming services and the decline of traditional pay-TV models. The service is set to launch in the first half of 2012 and is expected to make a big impact in the UK's pay-TV market. With its 'pay and go' model and strong relationships with content providers, Sky is well placed to take on the competition and redefine the way we watch television.
