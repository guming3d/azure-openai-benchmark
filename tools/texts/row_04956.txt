article: (CNN) -- American tennis legend Andre Agassi has admitted using crystal methamphetamine a year before he won the French Open in 1998, and that he lied to the sport's governing bodies in the same period about a positive drugs test to avoid a ban. The 39-year-old, who is only one of six men in history to have completed a career grand slam of winning titles at all four majors, confessed in his autobiography that he took the highly addictive narcotic in 1997 while suffering poor form and to quell worries about his upcoming marriage to actress Brooke Shields. The eight-time grand slam champion revealed in his book how he felt when he first took the substance -- possession of which carries a maximum five-year jail sentence in the United States. "Slim [Agassi's assistant] dumps a small pile of powder on the coffee table. He cuts it, snorts it. He cuts it again. I snort some. I ease back on the couch and consider the Rubicon I've just crossed. "There is a moment of regret, followed by vast sadness. Then comes a tidal wave of euphoria that sweeps away every negative thought in my head. I've never felt so alive, so hopeful -- and I've never felt such energy," Agassi recounted in an excerpt of his book that has been serialized by British newspaper The Times. Following his use of crystal meth, the former world number one pulled out of the French Open and admitted he did not practice for Wimbledon a month later. Later in the year an Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) doctor confirmed to Agassi -- who is currently married to former number one women's tennis player Steffi Graf -- that his use of recreational drugs had shown up in a positive dope test and that he faced a three-month suspension. The tennis great revealed how he lied in a bid to retain his reputation: "My name, my career, everything is now on the line. Whatever I've achieved, whatever I've worked for, might soon mean nothing. Days later I sit in a hard-backed chair, a legal pad in my lap, and write a letter to the ATP. "It's filled with lies interwoven with bits of truth. I say Slim, whom I've since fired, is a known drug user, and that he often spikes his sodas with meth - which is true. Then I come to the central lie of the letter. "I say that recently I drank accidentally from one of Slim's spiked sodas, unwittingly ingesting his drugs. I ask for understanding and leniency and hastily sign it: Sincerely. I feel ashamed, of course. I promise myself that this lie is the end of it,"  Agassi added. Following the letter from Agassi the ATP dropped the case, allowing the American to regain a form that would see him go on to win the French Open in 1998 and the U.S. Open in 1999 before retiring in 2006. The ATP have yet to comment following the revelations.

chatgpt: Former tennis star Andre Agassi has shocked the sporting world by admitting to once using crystal methamphetamine, a highly addictive illegal drug. Agassi revealed that he had used the drug in the year before winning the French Open in 1998, a historic and much-celebrated achievement that cemented his status as one of the sport's greatest ever players. The admission comes following years of speculation and rumors, with Agassi deciding to come clean in his new autobiography, "Open." In the book, the former world number one describes how he started using the drug after a low point in his emotional and physical wellbeing. "I can't speak to addiction, but a lot of people would say that if you're using anything as an escape, you have a problem," Agassi says in the book. "And I certainly had a problem." Agassi's confession has also revealed that he lied to the ATP, the governing body of men's professional tennis, to cover up a positive dope test. At the time, Agassi claimed that he had mistakenly ingested the drug after drinking from a spiked soda can. However, the truth was that he had failed a test and concocted the story to avoid punishment. Agassi's revelation has divided opinion amongst the tennis community, with some calling for him to be stripped of his titles and others expressing sympathy and admiration for his honesty. Agassi, who is one of only four men to ever complete a career grand slam, has clearly stated that he believes the achievements of his career are not invalidated by his drug use, but rather that they were a testament to his determination and skill. "I can't go back, but I can control the way I move forward," Agassi writes in his book. "I can continue to grow as a person, as a father, and as a champion of the game I love." The news has also raised larger questions about doping in tennis and the efforts of governing bodies to crack down on performance-enhancing drugs. In recent years, several high-profile players, including Maria Sharapova and Marin Cilic, have been suspended for using banned substances. Critics have pointed to Agassi's case as evidence that the current testing system is far from infallible and that players can easily deceive the authorities. They argue that a more rigorous and transparent approach is necessary to ensure that the sport remains clean and fair. Despite the controversy, Agassi remains a much-loved and respected figure in the tennis world, with fans and fellow players commending him for his bravery in coming forward. Many see his story as a testament to the power of redemption and the importance of honesty and accountability in sports and in life. In his book, Agassi writes that he hopes his story will inspire others to face their own challenges and find the strength to overcome them. For him, the admission of his drug use is not a mark of shame, but rather a testament to his growth and resilience as a person.
