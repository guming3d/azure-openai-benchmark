chatgpt: The Cleveland Browns have announced Brian Hoyer as their starting quarterback for the upcoming NFL season. This decision did not come as a surprise to many, as Hoyer had already shown his skills during the preseason games. Despite the competition from rookie quarterback Johnny Manziel, Hoyer proved to be the best candidate for the starting role. Manziel, on the other hand, has accepted his position as the back-up quarterback, and expressed his willingness to learn from Hoyer. This is a significant step for Manziel, as he had previously been considered a front-runner for the starting role. However, Manziel's behavior on the field during the Browns' preseason game against the Washington Redskins has raised eyebrows. During the game, Manziel reportedly showed his middle finger to the Redskins bench after coming off the field. This action has been criticized by many, who suggest that it shows a lack of respect and sportsmanship. Despite the controversy, Manziel has apologized for his behavior and stated that it will not happen again. Head coach Mike Pettine has also addressed the issue, stating that the team does not condone such behavior and that Manziel will face consequences for his actions. The Browns will start their season on September 7th, with a game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. The team will be looking to Hoyer to lead them to a successful season, while Manziel will be preparing to step up if and when he is needed. Overall, the Browns have a lot of potential this season, with a strong core of players and a talented coaching staff. It remains to be seen whether Hoyer can lead the team to success, and whether Manziel will get his chance to shine. Nonetheless, fans are eagerly looking forward to the start of the NFL season, and the excitement that it brings.
