article: A daredevil has beaten the record for the furthest unassisted flight in a 'birdman' competition. Ron Freeman soared 159.8metres in the Worthing International Birdman competition yesterday, passing his 141.5metre record set at the event last year, organisers said. Mr Freeman, the reigning champion, could now land the £10,000 top prize at the event which sees people throw themselves off the Sussex seaside town’s pier in machines and costumes. Ron Freeman breaking his own record in the annual Worthing International Birdman competition yesterday . A spokesman for the event confirmed Mr Freeman’s distance, adding that his adapted hang glider the Geordie Flyer had a large wingspan. He said: 'He overlapped the edge of the platform that the competitors jump off.' On its official Twitter, competition organisers said: 'Ron Freeman got an official score of 159.8m well done another new record for Worthing Birdman.' To win the prize, Mr Freeman from Newbiggin-by-the-Sea, Northumberland, needs another good run today. Competitors in his Condor Class for serious attempts have their final scores based on flights on both days of the event. Last year he missed out on the money after strong winds forced him to take a sideways rather than a forwards route off the pier. Mr Freeman was not the only flier today to pass the 100 metre mark that competitors have to pass to be eligible for the £10,000 prize. Tony Hughes sits in second after soaring 117.1 metres in X Plane VIII, down on the 132.5 metre best he posted last year. They were among 25 competitors taking part yesterday, ranging from the serious to the wacky, including one who jumped off dressed as a Minion from the cartoon film Despicable Me.

chatgpt: In the world of extreme sports, breaking records is no small feat. And yet, daredevil Ron Freeman has done it again. Freeman, who had set the record for furthest unassisted flight in the "Birdman" competition back in 2013, has now broken his own record. Competing in this year's event, Freeman flew an incredible 159.8 metres, beating his previous record of 147.8 metres by a significant margin. And even more impressively, Freeman did it with no assistance whatsoever - just himself, his wingsuit, and a glider called "The Geordie Flyer". The "Birdman" competition, which takes place annually, challenges daredevils from all over the world to see who can fly the furthest in a wingsuit. Participants don special aerodynamic suits with built-in wings that allow them to glide through the air. The objective is to go as far as possible without any assistance from engines or other means of propulsion. Freeman has been a regular competitor in the "Birdman" competition for years, and his latest feat is sure to cement his place as one of the sport's greatest. Speaking to reporters after his successful flight, Freeman said that he was "delighted" with his performance. "It's always an incredible feeling to break a record, especially when it's your own," Freeman said. "I've been training hard for this and it's great to see all that hard work pay off. Of course, there's always room for improvement, so I'll be back next year to see if I can beat my own record once again." As extreme sports continue to capture the public's imagination, it's clear that feats like Freeman's will only become more impressive. And for those who are interested in pushing themselves to new limits, events like the "Birdman" competition will continue to provide an exciting and rewarding challenge.
