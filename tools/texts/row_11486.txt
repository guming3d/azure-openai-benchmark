chatgpt: Crystal Palace football club has made a significant transfer deadline day signing by securing the services of Wilfried Zaha on a permanent deal. The 28-year-old winger started his professional career at Palace before making a big-money move to Manchester United in 2013. However, he failed to break into the first team, leading to his eventual return to Selhurst Park on loan in 2014. Zaha's performances during the loan spell were impressive, and it was clear that Palace wanted him to remain at the club. They managed to secure his services permanently in February 2015 for a fee of around £3m. Zaha's return to his boyhood club proved to be a turning point in his career as he established himself as one of the most exciting players in the Premier League. He helped Palace avoid relegation in the 2015-16 season, and since then, he has been the club's talisman, scoring crucial goals and providing assists. The Ivorian international has been linked with a move away from Palace over the years, with several big clubs vying for his signature. However, he has always remained loyal to Palace and has signed a five-year contract extension in 2018. The past few transfer windows have seen Zaha's name once again linked with a move away from Palace. However, this transfer window has been different, with the winger expressing his desire to leave the club due to his lack of progress at Selhurst Park. Palace's valuation of Zaha was initially a stumbling block, with the club reportedly demanding around £80m for the player's services. However, with the transfer window drawing to a close, Palace reduced their asking price, and Zaha was able to secure a move back to his boyhood club for a fee of around £6m. Zaha's move back to Palace has been met with excitement by both the club's fans and the player himself. The winger has been vocal about his love for the club, and his return will undoubtedly boost Palace's hopes of survival this season. In conclusion, Wilfried Zaha's move back to Crystal Palace is a significant coup for the club. The Ivorian international's return will add an extra dimension to Palace's attacking play and provide a much-needed boost to the club's morale. Fans will be eagerly awaiting his return to Selhurst Park, and it will be interesting to see how much of an impact he has on the team going forward.
