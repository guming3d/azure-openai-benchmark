article: Georgia authorities have arrested 14 people they accuse of traveling with the intent to have sex with children, including a suburban Atlanta elementary school principal, according to CNN affiliates and school system officials. "I was notified (Sunday) that Mt. Carmel Elementary School Principal John McGill was arrested this weekend and is under investigation," said Douglas County School Superintendent Gordon Pritz. McGill has been suspended pending the state investigation, and the school system is cooperating with police, he said. The principal was released on a $50,000 bond Tuesday and was told to have no contact with minors unless they were family members -- and those visits must be supervised -- and to not use the Internet for pornography, his attorney, Mac Pilgrim, said. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation's sting targeted "persons who communicate with children on-line and then travel to meet them for the purpose of having sex," a news release said. It continued, "Online child predators visit chat rooms and websites on the Internet, find children, begin conversations with them, introduce sexual content and arrange a meeting with the children for the purpose for having sex." Before taking the job at Mt. Carmel, McGill was the principal at two other schools -- one in the Douglas County system, the other out of state, said county schools spokeswoman Karen Stroud. McGill has worked for the county since 2004, she said. The principal was arrested Sunday and charged with electronic pornography and violation of the Child Exploitation Prevention Act of 1999, the GBI said. Pilgrim said his client's cell phone was confiscated as evidence when he was arrested. Pilgrim said Monday he had spoken to McGill's wife, but not McGill, so he couldn't say how he intended to plead in the case. The GBI says that McGill and 13 others were arrested over a four-day period as part of Operation Broken Heart, a sting involving 37 local, state and federal law enforcement agencies. "The operation took months of planning. The arrestees, ranging in age from 21 to 64, traveled from all parts of northern Georgia with the intent to meet a child for sex. Some of their occupations included educator, engineer, laborer, salesman, business owner, software developer, and a musician," a GBI news release said.

chatgpt: A Georgia principal has been arrested in a sting operation by the state police targeting individuals found online, arranging to have sex with minors. Douglas County Principal, whose identity is yet to be revealed to the public, was released on a $50,000 bond with strict conditions that he stay away from children. According to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI), the operation was conducted after months of investigating individuals who were found participating in online chats and arranging for sexual activities with minors. The investigation was aimed at protecting vulnerable children from predators who lurk online. The principal was arrested and his phone confiscated as evidence, according to his defense attorney. Reports suggest that the principal was among the many individuals who were caught in the sting operation. The arrest has sent shock waves through the community, as parents express their concerns about the safety of their children while in school. The school district has yet to issue a statement on the situation, but the community has expressed their outrage and concern. The GBI released a statement saying that they will continue to work diligently to investigate and apprehend those who prey on children. They urged parents to monitor their children's online activities and report any suspicious behavior to the authorities. Sexual exploitation of minors has become a major cause for concern across the country. With the rise in technology, predators have found a new way to exploit vulnerable children by using the internet as a tool to find and arrange harmful activities. Government agencies and other organizations have stepped up their efforts to eradicate the problem, conducting sting operations and educating the public about the dangers of online activities. The Douglas County principal's arrest is a grim reminder of the severity of the problem and the need for vigilance. Parents need to be aware of their children's online activities and teach them about online safety. Schools, in turn, have a responsibility to protect their students from harm, including predatory behavior online. The principal's case is under investigation, and it remains to be seen what will happen in court. What is clear, however, is that the need for education and awareness about online safety has never been greater. The community will continue to watch and wait for updates on the case, and hope for justice for the victims and their families.
