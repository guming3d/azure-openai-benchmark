article: Mohamed has been revealed as the most popular baby name in Israel – despite authorities trying to keep it hidden from the annual official list. The Population and Immigration Authority has this week published a list of the 10 most popular boys and girls names of those born in Israel this year. However, it has omitted  Arabic baby names from the list, including Mohamed which should have topped the boys' list and Ahmed which should have placed ninth. The Population and Immigration Authority has published a list of the 10 most popular boys and girls names of those born in Israel this year but has failed to include Arabic names including the top choice of Mohamed . Instead, the authority claims that the most commonly used Israeli boys' names over the last 12 months were: Yosef, Daniel, Uri, Itai, Omer, Adam, Noam, Ariel, Eitan, David. Nowhere in its statement, which was released ahead of the Jewish New Year, did it note the fact that Arabic baby names had been withheld. It lists the most popular girls' name as Tamar, which pushes Noa into second place after spending 14 years in the top spot. Other popular girls' names include: Shira, Adele, Talya, Yael, Lian, Miriam, Maya and Avigayil. Lian, Miriam (Maryam) and Maya are used by both Jews and Arabs. However, the authority has come under fire after being accused by Israeli news service Haaretz of omitting Arabic names from the official list of boys' names. The news service said several Arab names were statistically more popular than the ones on the official list - including Mohamed. The Population and Immigration Authority said its list reflected the media's interest in popular Hebrew names . The Population and Immigration Authority responded by saying the list reflected the media's interest in popular Hebrew names. It also said it had no intention of skewing the facts, with spokesman Sabine Hadad adding: 'There is no plot to deliberately hide information.' The authority put out a similar list last year, also without citing the fact that it included only Hebrew names. According to the authority, 176,230 babies were born in Israel this year — 90,646 boys and 85,584 girls. Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics reported in May that 8.18 million people live in Israel, including a population of over six million Jews.

chatgpt: Mohamed has been deemed the most popular name among boys born in Israel this year, according to recent reports. However, despite the significant Arab population in the country, the official list of most commonly used names failed to include any Arabic names. The annual list of top baby names in Israel is released by the country’s Interior Ministry. This year, the list was topped by the name Yosef, followed by David, Uri, and Ariel. Meanwhile, Mohamed was the most popular name for boys, followed by Noam and Adam. The omission of any Arabic names on the list has sparked controversy and criticism from some groups in Israel. The country has a significant Arab population, with about 21% of Israelis being Arab, yet Arabic names have not been included on the list of top baby names for several years. The Interior Ministry defended the list, stating that the names included on it reflect the “interest in Hebrew names” among the Jewish population. The list is based on data collected from the Population and Immigration Authority and takes into account names given in the Jewish, Muslim, and Christian communities. However, critics argue that the exclusion of Arabic names is a deliberate attempt to minimize the Arab presence in Israel and contribute to the erasure of their culture and identity. Many also note that Israel has a history of discrimination against its Arab citizens, including restrictions on the use of their language in official settings. Despite the controversy, the popularity of Mohamed as a name for boys born in Israel is noteworthy. The name is of Arabic origin and is associated with the Islamic prophet Muhammad. In recent years, it has become a popular name among Muslim families around the world. The most popular name for girls born in Israel this year was Tamar, followed by Maya, Sara, and Avigail. Interestingly, the name Tamar is also of Arabic origin and was the name of a prominent figure in the Old Testament. It is unclear whether the omission of Arabic names on the list also extends to the most popular names for girls. Overall, the inclusion or exclusion of certain names on the list of top baby names in Israel may seem trivial, but it speaks to larger issues of identity and representation for different groups in the country. It remains to be seen whether changes will be made to the list in the future to better reflect the diversity of Israel’s population.
