British playboy: Billy Thomas is said to be behind JDI Dating which was fined in the US for using 'virtual cupids' to lure singles into signing up for paid subscriptions - something the site continues to do . JDI Dating is a Hampshire-based network of online dating sites including CupidsWand.com and FindMeLove.com . Last month the firm paid nearly £400,000 to settle a case in the US brought by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for allegedly using 'virtual Cupids' to encourage internet users to sign up to a website. The scheme works by matching users with attractive singles who live nearby and have seemingly genuine profiles that include photographs and list their interests. According to an investigation by The Sunday Times, Mr Thomas is continuing to use virtual Cupids. Within minutes of creating a profile one of its reporters was contacted by a 23-year-old woman, but when he tried to reply to her the journalist was redirected to a subscription page, where he was informed he could sign up for a £101 a year. A short time later another woman contacted him. An attempt to respond to her also led the reporter to the subscriptions page. According to the Sunday Times, both women's profiles were created by the dating site, something that was indicated by a small grey VC symbol in the top right corner of the profile. JDI Dating owns 18 websites, including CupidsWand.com, and boasts having 12million global members . When the symbol is clicked the customer is directed to the sites terms and conditions, which states the site uses virtual profiles. JDI Dating owns 18 websites and boasts having 12million global members. Tests conducted by the paper on the JDI website, DateAgency.com's homepage revealed all of the 'most popular' profiles were those of virtual Cupids. Mr Thomas previously worked at Intellichat which created an 'automated sales agent' it claimed could dissuade customers from leaving websites. Intellichat directors founded JDI Dating in 2010, but sold it to American investors in 2011. Mr Thomas was then made chief executive. A JDI Dating spokesman told The Sunday Times of the FTC fine last month: 'JDI has reached a solution to these issues with the regulatory authority without admitting any wrongdoing, and thus will not respond point by point to the issues raised. He added: 'JDI obtains proper licences to display all content associated with virtual Cupid profiles. 'JDI cannot comment as to how other sites, or the copyright holder, might decide to use or promote the same content.'

chatgpt: The founder of JDI Dating, British playboy Billy Thomas, has come under fire once again as an investigation reveals the dating website is still using fake profiles. JDI Dating gained notoriety for using "virtual Cupids" to lure in customers, leading to a £400,000 settlement last month. Despite claims from JDI Dating that they have cleaned up their act, a recent investigation has found evidence to the contrary. The company, which owns 18 dating websites and claims to have 12 million subscribers, is allegedly still using fake profiles to entice users. The use of virtual Cupids, or fake profiles that are controlled by website administrators, is a controversial tactic that has been widely criticized by the dating industry. The practice involves creating profiles that are designed to look like real people, in order to generate interest and interaction on the site. JDI Dating has been accused of using these fake profiles to send out automated messages to users, tricking them into thinking that they are receiving messages from other genuine users. In reality, these messages are being sent by the website administrators, who are using the virtual Cupids to generate more activity on the site. The investigation into JDI Dating was carried out by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), which is responsible for enforcing privacy laws in the UK. The ICO found that JDI Dating was not only using fake profiles, but was also failing to adequately inform users about their data processing practices. The result of the investigation was a fine of £400,000 for JDI Dating, which was described by the ICO as a "serious breach of privacy laws". The fine was significantly higher than other fines handed out by the ICO for similar breaches, reflecting the severity of the offence. Despite the fine, JDI Dating has apparently not cleaned up its act. The use of fake profiles is a serious breach of trust between the company and its users, and undermines the entire premise of online dating. In response to the investigation, JDI Dating has stated that it has "taken steps to remove and prevent the use of virtual Cupids". However, it is unclear what these steps are, and whether they have actually been effective in stopping the use of fake profiles on the site. The use of virtual Cupids is a controversial tactic that has been widely criticized by the dating industry, and for good reason. It undermines the trust between users and the website, and creates an artificial environment that is not conducive to meaningful connections. As JDI Dating continues to operate in the shadows, it is up to the dating industry to take a stand against these unethical practices. The use of fake profiles is not only illegal, but it is also immoral, and undermines the very foundation of online dating. If the industry is to maintain its integrity, it must take action against companies like JDI Dating that engage in such practices.
