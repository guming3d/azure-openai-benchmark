Symptoms such as irritability are often unfairly blamed on a woman's period, say Canadian researchers . Premenstrual syndrome in women has been over-estimated and may not be the cause of women’s bad moods at certain times of the month. That’s the controversial suggestion by Canadian researchers, who have suggested that symptoms such as irritability are often unfairly blamed on a woman’s period when other factors such as stress or a lack of support may be to blame. In a new study published in the journal Gender Medicine, researchers at the University of Toronto assessed a wealth of research relating to premenstrual syndrome (PMS). They concluded it ‘failed to provide clear evidence in support of the existence of a specific premenstrual negative mood syndrome’. The problem is we tend to dismissively blame everything on PMS, disregarding other reasons why women may be angry or upset. ‘The idea that any emotionality in women can be firstly attributed to their reproductive function  - we're sceptical about that,’  lead researcher Dr Sarah Romans told The Atlantic. ‘I think most would assume that PMS is much more firmly evidence-based than in fact it is.’ Dr Roman and her colleagues assessed more than 40 studies relating to PMS. While many found some association with mood at various times of a woman’s cycle, there was no clear pattern as to which part of the cycle was affected and sometimes no relationship at all. While there is a link between low mood at various times of a woman's cycle, there was no clear pattern as to which part of the cycle was affected . Thirty-sex per cent found no association between mood and the menstrual cycle. Another 42 per cent ‘found an association of negative mood in the premenstrual phase, combined with another phase of the menstrual cycle.’ Only 13 per cent found an association between negative mood and the premenstrual phase. This suggests that hormonal fluctuations related to the menstrual cycle aren't necessarily to blame. And ‘when there is a menstrual cycle tie-up it's actually perimenstrual -- the premenstrual (3-5 days before menstruation) and the menstrual phases together -- not purely premenstrual.’ added Dr Romans. She continued: ‘I think this can be seen as the modern day equivalent of the old wandering womb notion – that  women are hysterical because of their reproductive system. 'And when a woman's upset, it's still often one of the first thoughts people have - maybe she's premenstrual, rather than 'Is her physical health bad? Is she under a lot of stress? Is she lacking social support?'" Negative moods have long been associated with the menstrual cycle, with references to the issue found in medical literature as far back as the 1930s.

chatgpt: Canadian researchers have suggested that blame to women's hormonal fluctuations during their period as the cause of their symptoms, such as irritability, is often unfair. According to them, there is no strong evidence to suggest that hormone fluctuations are responsible for low mood. This new research argues that the symptoms commonly associated with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) are not necessarily linked to hormonal fluctuations. Researchers conducted a review of previous studies on PMS, including those that measured hormone levels in women throughout their menstrual cycle. They found no evidence to suggest that hormone fluctuations are the primary cause of PMS symptoms. Lead author of the study, Dr. Sarah Romans, explained that previous studies on PMS may have been biased because they primarily focused on women already diagnosed with the condition. This approach could have led to a mischaracterization of PMS as primarily linked to hormonal fluctuations. Dr. Romans and her colleagues emphasized that hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle are a normal and expected part of a woman's reproductive health. However, they argue that there is a danger in assuming that all mood changes during this time are related to hormones. The researchers suggest that a more holistic approach to understanding PMS is needed. They argued that PMS is a multi-dimensional disorder with a range of physical and emotional symptoms. Dr. Romans added that other factors, such as stress, poor sleep, and poor nutrition, could also contribute to PMS symptoms. This research adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that PMS is a complex and multifactorial condition. It highlights the need to move away from a simplistic view that blames women's hormonal fluctuations for their symptoms. Commenting on the study, Professor Henry Burger, a leading endocrinologist, argued that the findings were not surprising. He explained that while hormones could contribute to some PMS symptoms, they were unlikely to be the primary cause of the condition. Professor Burger also emphasized the need for more awareness around the issue of PMS. He argued that too often, women's menstrual cycles are dismissed or stigmatized, yet they have a significant impact on women's lives. The researchers hope that their study will encourage healthcare professionals to take a more nuanced approach to understanding PMS. They also suggest that more research is needed to better understand the causes of PMS and to develop effective treatments. In conclusion, Canadian researchers have suggested that blaming women's hormonal fluctuations for symptoms such as irritability during their period is often unfair. They argue that there is no strong evidence to suggest that hormone fluctuations are responsible for low mood. This study highlights the need for a more holistic approach to understanding PMS, and for greater awareness of the impact of women's menstrual cycles on their lives.
