article: Fashion designer Kenneth Cole has broken the Guinness Record for the World's Largest Replica High Heel shoe after creating a 73 inch model of his brand's popular $225 Otto heel. The 60-year-old fashion veteran was enlisted by Today show correspondent Jill Martin, who earlier this year confessed that breaking a world record was on her bucket list. 'After I listed 'I want to break a world record' on my bucket list, I search the Guinness World record site, to see what record I could possibly break,' Jill, 38, said on the show. 'You know, I'm not the tallest person, I'm not the shortest person, I don't have the longest finger nails - but I do know shoes. Scroll down for video . We did it! Kenneth Cole (R) and Jill Martin (L) celebrate their World Record achievement alongside the official Guinness Record Adjudicator . 'So I needed to find a shoe to replicate and I thought "who is quirky and cool enough to want this title?"' Kenneth and Jill called on the services of Izquierdo Studio, a custom costumes and props company, who offered to help them turn their lofty shoe dreams into a reality. 'Footwear in and of itself might be one of the most difficult products to bring to market because it's not just about designing,' Kenneth told the New York Post. 'It's about engineering and it's about sculpting, and ultimately it has to be a perfect proportion in order for it to fit and hold the weight of its inhabiter. And then to take it and change its scale is an even greater feat.' Kenneth and Jill's mammoth Otto replica, which was verified by an official Guinness Record Adjudicator on Thursday, trampled all over the former record, which was set in 1996 by Edmund Kryza of Poland with a replica pump measuring 44 inches high and 72 inches long. But it wasn't an easy feat finding enough materials to create the statuesque Otto statue; the bootie is made from 6,000 sq ft of calfskin and hand-cut foam, while the buckle was created with a 3-D printer, and the design even comes complete with a fully functional zipper. Little and large: The replica shoe weighs almost 150 times the original Otto design . 'I’ve never had kids, but I feel like I just had one,' Jill admitted. 'It was stressful, exhilarating, random. It was a real labor of love.' The whole shoe weighs a whopping 150 pounds, nearly 150 times the original wearable version currently on sale on the Kenneth Cole website. 'We met with ten different shoe builders because it is not easy to find somebody to build [this],' Jill said. 'There are lots of shoe makers, but there are not many shoe builders,' Kenneth added. The shoe is currently on display at department store Lord & Taylor’s flagship on Fifth Avenue in New York.

chatgpt: A new shoe has been making waves in the fashion world as it's a copy of a popular designer's $225 'Otto' bootie. The shoe is not only a replica of the original design, but it's also been vastly enlarged in size. The shoe is an astounding 73 inches tall and 77 inches long, making it a true spectacle to behold. The designer of the original 'Otto' bootie has been in the fashion industry for over a decade and is widely recognized for her unique and distinctive designs. Her 'Otto' bootie has been one of her most popular creations, selling out within days of its release on numerous occasions. The bootie is designed with a sleek silhouette, bold patterns, and a pointed toe. It's constructed with high-quality materials, which makes it last longer than a regular bootie. The copy of the 'Otto' bootie has been recreated with remarkable accuracy, capturing all of the original design elements. The replica features the same pointed toe, bold patterns, and sleek silhouette, making it hard to distinguish between the two when taking a quick glance. While it doesn't boast the same high-quality materials that make the original last longer, the shoe has been made with the same level of attention to detail. However, what sets the replica apart from its original design is its sheer size. Measuring a staggering 73 inches tall and 77 inches long, this shoe is truly a sight to behold. The shoe rises well above the ankle, making it impossible to wear with everyday clothing, but that hasn't stopped fashion enthusiasts from admiring it from afar. The larger-than-life shoe has been the talk of the town since it was first unveiled. Many fashion enthusiasts have been eager to get their hands on a pair, while others are more content with simply admiring the shoe from a distance. "It's a stunning piece of design," said one fashion critic. "The proportions are completely out of the ordinary, and it looks like nothing else out there." The shoe has been causing a stir on social media as well, with many fashion influencers showcasing the shoe on their profiles. Some have even gone as far as creating their own custom outfits to wear with the shoe, taking inspiration from its unique design elements. Despite the shoe's popularity, it's still unclear whether the designer of the original bootie will take any legal action against the makers of the replica. The designer has yet to make a statement on the issue, leaving many to speculate on what the future holds for this controversial copy. In conclusion, the new shoe that's a copy of the popular 'Otto' bootie has made headlines in the fashion industry due to its huge size. This replica has been constructed with remarkable accuracy, and its unique design elements have captured the hearts of many. Although it's unclear what the future holds for this controversial copy, one thing that's certain is that it's certainly causing a stir in the fashion world.
