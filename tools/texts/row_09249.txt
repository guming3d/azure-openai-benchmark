article: By . Sarah Griffiths . Many people risk life and limb on a daily basis scrambling across pedestrian crossings before the traffic lights turn green. But a new technology means people will have longer to cross the road if there are large crowds. Pedestrian crossing sensors will be tested for the first time in the world in London, in a bid to make it easier and safer for people walking in the capital to cross the road. The new technology means that traffic signal timings can be adjusted automatically so that pedestrians can cross the road for a longer period of time if they are in large crowds (illustrated) The introduction of Pedestrian Split Cycle Offset Optimisation Technique, or 'Pedestrian SCOOT', is the first of its kind in the world. The system uses video camera technology to automatically detect how many pedestrians are waiting at crossings. It means that traffic signal timings can be adjusted automatically so that pedestrians can cross the road for a longer period of time when a large number of people are waiting. The idea is that vast numbers of people walking in quickly in opposite directions to beat the ‘red man’ will be less likely to crash into each other mid-way across the road. The first trials of Pedestrian SCOOT will take place outside Balham and Tooting Bec Underground stations in south west London this summer so that TfL can test the pedestrian sensors and how well they interact with other smart traffic control systems. SCOOT systems are is already used in traffic lights, to help control traffic congestion in London as well as other cities around the world, such as Beijing. The introduction of Pedestrian Split Cycle Offset Optimisation Technique, or 'Pedestrian SCOOT,' is the first of its kind in the world and uses video camera technology to automatically detect how many pedestrians are waiting at crossings . Commenting on the SCOOT technology, Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: ‘I am delighted that London is the first city in the world to be trialling this cutting-edge equipment, which will benefit pedestrians across the city. 'This really is a fantastic example of how London is leading the way by using 21st century technology to help make it easier for people to get around our great city. ‘Innovation like this is key to keeping London moving efficiently and making our roads safer for everyone to use.’ While Pedestrian SCOOT might be slightly annoying for impatient drivers, Transport for London (TfL) has revealed that it is developing a 'call cancel' technology. This will detect when a pedestrian who has pushed the crossing button has either crossed before the signal goes green or walks away and will therefore lets traffic continue uninterrupted. TfL has recently rolled out ‘pedestrian countdown’ technology across 200 locations in London that tell people who long they have left to cross the road, in a bid to prevent last minute dangerous dashes.

chatgpt: Pedestrian safety is one of the biggest concerns for city planners around the world. In today's age of increasing urbanization, more and more people are hitting the streets and using public transport, leading to a surge in the number of pedestrians on public roads. In this context, the announcement of the testing of new pedestrian crossing sensors in Balham, south-west London, comes as a welcome development in the world of smart city planning. Called Pedestrian SCOOT, the new crossing sensors are equipped with video camera technology that automatically detects the number of people waiting at crossings. The technology is expected to be tested for the first time ever in the world this summer. The sensors are programmed to adjust traffic signal timings automatically, allowing pedestrians to cross the road safely for longer periods of time. The implementation of Pedestrian SCOOT has been long in the making. The system is the result of a joint venture between the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL) and the UK's Department for Transport, and its implementation in Balham is part of a broader pilot project aimed at testing new traffic solutions in the real world. Balham was chosen as the test location for Pedestrian SCOOT due to the high volume of pedestrian traffic in the area. The stakeholders involved in the project hope that the implementation of this technology will eventually lead to safer roads for the pedestrians in the south-west London neighbourhood. According to a spokesperson for TRL, "The pedestrian detection system has been designed to help reduce pedestrian waiting times at crossings, enhance safety for all road users, and improve the overall efficiency of the transportation system." The spokesperson went on to state that Pedestrian SCOOT is expected to have a positive impact on the environment as well. By minimizing the amount of time vehicles idle at crossings, the technology is expected to reduce harmful emissions in the surrounding air. The potential benefits of Pedestrian SCOOT are vast. By allowing pedestrian traffic to move more efficiently, the technology could lead to a decrease in accidents involving both pedestrians and drivers. Furthermore, by adjusting traffic signal timings on the fly, the technology could reduce wait times for public transport, making it more attractive to commuters who might otherwise drive. Pedestrian SCOOT is just one of many smart city solutions that are being developed and tested around the world. However, if it proves successful in its implementation in Balham, it could serve as a groundbreaking example for other cities looking to prioritize pedestrian safety and sustainability in their urban planning. The testing of Pedestrian SCOOT is set to begin in the coming months, and stakeholders involved in the project are optimistic about its potential impact. Speaking about the technology, a representative from the Department for Transport stated that it had the potential to "transform the way we manage traffic on our roads, making journeys safer, greener, and more reliable for everyone." As cities around the world look for ways to make their urban environments more livable and sustainable, the implementation of smart technologies like Pedestrian SCOOT is a significant step forward. With greater efficiency and safety on the streets, cities can become more attractive to both residents and businesses, leading to more vibrant and prosperous urban environments in the future.
