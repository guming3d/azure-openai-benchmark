But the Foreign Office insisted the activities were 'wholly legitimate and legal' and entirely under the control of the Government of the island - a British overseas territory. Argentina has announced new laws preventing oil firms from operating off the Falkland Islands . Royal Navy ship HMS Montrose on patrol near Stanley Harbour. The British says it works within international law and operations are 'wholly legitimate and legal' Islanders voted by 1,513 to three to remain a British overseas territory in a referendum in March but Argentina has since stepped up its claim over the territory at the United Nations. Buenos Aires has issued repeated written legal warnings to firms that they face administrative, civil and criminal action for operating off the islands - which Argentina calls Las Malvinas. The embassy said in a statement that the law includes 15-year prison sentences and fines equivalent to the value of 1.5million barrels of oil. It added that the law provides for the banning of individuals and companies from operating in Argentina and the confiscation of equipment.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'Hydrocarbons activities by any company operating on the continental shelf of the Falkland Islands are regulated by legislation of the Falkland Islands Government, in strict accordance with the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea.

chatgpt: Argentina's embassy in London announced on Monday that they are imposing new laws directed towards offshore oil operations in the Falkland Islands. The new legislation, passed by the Argentine Congress, imposes a fine, equivalent to 1.5 million barrels of oil, and a ban in Argentina, on any company carrying out offshore oil exploration or drilling in the area. The embassy claims that such operations are a breach of a United Nations resolution established in 1965, which demands that Argentina and the United Kingdom negotiate to find a solution for the sovereignty over Malvinas Islands.   The British government has criticized the Argentine move and the updated Foreign Office's statement argued that oil exploration is "wholly legitimate and legal". It also underlined that the updates do not have an impact on the United Kingdom's position on the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands or South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, which are self-governed overseas territories of the United Kingdom.   Argentina and the United Kingdom have been in a longstanding dispute over the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands. The British Overseas Territory has been under British control for over 150 years, and the population is predominantly British. However, Argentina has repeatedly laid claim to the islands, which they call Las Malvinas, and views the British presence there as an "illegal occupation." This latest move by Argentina comes as the Falklands are experiencing a boom in offshore oil exploration. British companies have been working in the area since the early 2000s, and in recent years, major oil companies such as Premier Oil, Rockhopper Exploration, and Falkland Oil and Gas have discovered significant oil reserves.  According to the Falkland Islands government, the oil industry has transformed the islands' economy, boosting employment and funding for public services. However, Argentina argues that the oil operations are illegal and a violation of Argentina's territorial sovereignty, which has pushed them to exert their power. Many analysts see this move from Argentina more on a political level rather than a military or economic one. The Argentine government has been vying for a diplomatic victory to regain their claim over the islands that could help the country's image amid an economic downturn, political uncertainty, and a sense of isolation within the international community.  The UK Foreign Office reiterated its position and highlighted its sovereignty over the islands amid Argentina's call for negotiations with the UK. This would not be the first time that the United Kingdom had found themselves in a similar situation. In 1982, the UK and Argentina went to war over the islands, which saw the UK victory and the end of Argentina's military dictatorship. The Falklands continue to be a potential landmine in the relations between the two nations, despite diplomatic efforts to find a peaceful resolution.  In conclusion, Argentina's latest move is likely to spark controversy over the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands. With significant oil reserves located near the islands, both Argentina and the United Kingdom have been quick to claim the valuable resources. While Argentina views the offshore oil operation as a breach of United Nations resolutions concerning their sovereignty, the UK remains firm that it is wholly legitimate and legal. As both countries continue to defend their positions, the dispute is far from over.
