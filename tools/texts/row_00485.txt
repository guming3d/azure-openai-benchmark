chatgpt: Havant & Waterlooville suffered a disappointing defeat against League One club Preston North End in the first round of the FA Cup. The match, which was played at the Lancashire team's home ground, ended in a 3-0 victory for the hosts. Despite their valiant efforts, Havant were unable to match Preston's pace and skill throughout the game. After a goalless first half, Preston came out strong and scored three goals in quick succession. The first goal was scored by Callum Robinson just four minutes into the second half, followed by two more goals from fellow Preston players. The game took a turn for the worse for Havant when two of its players, Brian Stock and Warren Cummings, were sent off in the second half.

The result means that Preston North End will advance to the second round of the FA Cup. They will face either Walsall or Shrewsbury in the next round. Despite the disappointment of the defeat, Havant & Waterlooville can hold their heads high after giving it their all against a strong League One club.
