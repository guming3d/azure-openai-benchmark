article: There have been a lot of attempts to win the title of cheesiest 2015 calender. But with six weeks still to go until January 1, a group of French women have swooped in and stolen the crown. All it took was... well, some lumps of actual cheese. It's 10th birthday of the Calendrier des From Girls (Cheese Girls calendar). Every month has a scantily clad woman posing with a piece of cheese . The Calendrier des From Girls (Cheese Girls calendar) is celebrating a decade of existence this year, with their 2015 offering marking ten years since the first was published. Every month features a scantily-clad woman posing in a suggestive manner with a piece of cheese. The dairy products range from goats cheese to Camembert and are featured on the month when they are traditionally produced the most. The calendar costs €19 (£15.18) plus postage and packing, with proceeds going to L'Association Fromages de Terroirs (The Association Of Regional Cheeses). The month of June features the Mothais goat cheese, which was was first made in the Deux-Sevres region, where it is still produced on the farms . The month of July features Banon AOP - an unpasterised goat cheese made in the region around the town of Banon in Provence, south-east France . The association fights the cause of unpasteurised cheeses, as the numbers of people eating them have diminished greatly in France in recent years. The calendar is the brainchild of Véronique Richez-Lerouge, who also founded the organisation and the country's National Cheese Day. The website reads: 'The profits of sales are completely put back to the Association which militates for 12 years for the unpasteurised milk cheeses and their preservation in the French heritage.' Camembert is the star cheese for March. It is is Normandy's most famous cheese, which takes its name from the village near Vimoutiers, in the Orne region . Mimolette is a cheese traditionally produced around the city of Lille, France. Cheese mites are intentionally used on the outside of the cheese to create extra flavour - this process led o the US banning the product . The website continues: 'Your contribution is precious to help us to follow our fight against the standardization. 'Farmers and producers continue to make some cheese in the respect for the product and for the values. 'Those need your support and there is only you, as consumer, who can act.' Neufchâtel is the cheese for February. It is one of the oldest cheeses in France and is thought to date back to the 6th century . The calendar costs €19 (£15.18) plus postage and packing, with proceeds going to L'Association Fromages de Terroirs (The Association Of Regional Cheeses)

chatgpt: It's a calendar like no other, and today it's celebrating its 10th anniversary. The Calendrier des From Girls, also known as the Cheese Girls Calendar, has been the subject of controversy since its inception in 2010. Every year, twelve women have posed scantily clad with a piece of cheese, and the proceeds go to The French Association Of Regional Cheeses. This year's calendar features women from all over France, each with their own unique style and personality. From the sultry brunette holding a slice of camembert to the playful blonde posing with her baguette, each month offers a new, cheesy delight. The founder of the calendar, Muriel Jacquet, said she was inspired by the success of similar calendars featuring scantily clad women. However, instead of using models, Jacquet decided to use authentic cheesemakers to model with their products. "I wanted to do something that was fun and playful, but also highlighted the amazing cheeses of France," Jacquet said in an interview. "And what better way to show off the beauty of cheese than by pairing it with beautiful women?" The calendar has faced criticism in the past, with some accusing it of perpetuating stereotypes of women and objectifying them. Jacquet, however, argues that the women who pose for the calendar do so willingly and are proud to be a part of the project. "None of these women are being forced to pose for the calendar," Jacquet said. "In fact, many of them are cheesemakers themselves and want to show off their products in a new and innovative way." Despite the controversy, the calendar has continued to sell well over the years, with all proceeds going to The French Association Of Regional Cheeses. The organization works to support small-scale cheese producers in France and promote traditional cheese-making methods. "The calendar has been instrumental in helping to support our work," said Marie-Christine Arnaud, the director of The French Association Of Regional Cheeses. "Not only does it raise money for our organization, but it also helps to promote the diverse and unique cheeses of France." The Calendrier des From Girls has become a beloved tradition in France, with many eagerly anticipating the release of each year's calendar. And as the calendar celebrates its 10th year, it shows no signs of slowing down. "Each year, we strive to make the calendar even better than before," Jacquet said. "We want to highlight the beauty of cheese and the diversity of the women who make it. And if we can raise money for a good cause while doing it, even better."
