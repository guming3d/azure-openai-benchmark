Martinez said: 'It is unacceptable, that action from Papiss Cisse. 'You don't want to see that on a football pitch, that shouldn't be allowed. 'Two players fighting for their position at a dead-ball situation and you end up deciding to take the law [into your own hands] by elbowing a fellow professional, it's unacceptable and that should have been a red card.'

chatgpt: Newcastle United defeated Everton 3-2 in a thrilling league match at St James' Park on Sunday. The home team fought back from a goal down to secure all three points in a game that had its fair share of drama and controversy. Papiss Cisse was the hero for Newcastle, scoring the crucial first goal that cancelled out Everton's opener. However, the Senegalese striker was involved in a controversial incident moments before his goal. Cisse appeared to elbow Seamus Coleman at a corner, but the referee didn't spot the incident and allowed play to continue. Despite the controversy, Cisse remained focused and scored an excellent goal to put Newcastle back on level terms. His strike was a thing of beauty, as he latched onto a cross from the left-hand side and sent an unstoppable shot into the back of the net. Everton reacted well to going behind, and they regained the lead a few minutes later through a James Rodriguez goal. The Colombian playmaker showed his class by cutting inside and unleashing a powerful shot that flew past Newcastle goalkeeper Karl Darlow. However, Newcastle refused to give up, and they equalized again soon after. This time it was Allan Saint-Maximin who found the back of the net, with a well-placed shot that left Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford with no chance. The game was finely balanced at 2-2, but it was Newcastle who prevailed in the end. With just over ten minutes left on the clock, Callum Wilson scored the winning goal for the home team. The former Bournemouth striker showed great composure to take advantage of a defensive mistake and slot the ball home. The result was a huge boost for Newcastle, who have struggled for consistency this season. It was also a blow to Everton, who had started the game well and will be disappointed to leave Tyneside without any points. Despite the controversy surrounding Cisse's elbow on Coleman, the game was an excellent advertisement for English football. Both teams played with intensity and passion, and the match was a fine example of the drama and excitement that the Premier League can provide.
