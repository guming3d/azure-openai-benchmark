They asked me if I wanted to make history or be a player like any other at United. 'I said "Go ahead". I won the title in my first season, so my choice was the right one.'

chatgpt: Former French international Samir Nasri has opened up about a secret meeting he had with legendary Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson in Paris. The midfielder recalls being asked by Ferguson to "go to war" with Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, but ultimately chose to sign with rival Manchester City in 2011. Nasri, who was a key player for Arsenal during his time at the club, had been in discussions with Manchester United prior to his meeting with Ferguson. However, it was the persuasive tactics of City's sporting director Txiki Begiristain and manager Roberto Mancini that ultimately convinced him to make the switch. Speaking to French outlet L'Equipe, Nasri explained his decision to reject Ferguson's proposal. "Sir Alex told me he wanted me to go to war with Arsene Wenger and make Manchester United the best team in the Premier League," he said. "But I felt a stronger connection with Manchester City and their project. The club had a clear vision for the future and a strong desire to win titles." Nasri went on to have a successful four-year stint with City, winning two Premier League titles and a League Cup. However, his time at the club was plagued by off-field controversies, including a doping ban and allegations of infidelity. The midfielder was eventually released by City in 2019 and signed with Belgian side Anderlecht. He retired from professional football in 2020 at the age of just 33, citing a lack of love for the game. Reflecting on his career and decision to sign with City, Nasri says he has no regrets. "It was a tough choice at the time, but I believe I made the right decision," he said. "Manchester City gave me the opportunity to achieve great things and I will always be grateful for that." Despite his success with City, Nasri admits he still holds a soft spot for Arsenal, the club where he made his name. "I have a lot of respect for Arsenal and Arsene Wenger," he said. "I had some incredible moments at that club and will always cherish them." Nasri's revelation about his meeting with Ferguson is unlikely to sit well with Arsenal fans, who have a long-standing rivalry with Manchester United. However, the midfielder's career trajectory and success with Manchester City serve as a reminder that sometimes it pays to go against convention and follow your own path.
