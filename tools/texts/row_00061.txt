article: BERLIN, Germany (CNN)  -- Women's boxing will be included at the 2012 Olympic Games in London, the president of the International Olympic Committee announced Thursday.

The decision came during a two-day IOC Executive Board meeting in Berlin, at which board members also decided to propose golf and rugby for inclusion in the 2016 Olympic Games. "I can only rejoice about the decision of inclusion of women's boxing," IOC President Jacques Rogge told reporters. "I think it's a great decision. Boxing was the sole (Olympic) sport with no women involved.  "The sport of women's boxing has progressed a lot, a tremendous amount, in the last five years and it was about time to include them in the Games."  Have your say - should women's boxing be included? A men's class will likely be axed to make room for three women's weight categories at London 2012, the UK Press Association reported. Women will compete in the flyweight 48-51kg class, lightweight 56-60kg and middleweight 69-75kg, the agency said. When the IOC dropped baseball and softball from the 2012 Olympic program several years ago, it said it would consider adding new sports that had a clean reputation and a wide appeal. Rogge pointed out that women's boxing has around 200 athletes who could potentially compete in 2012, while softball has only around 120. As a result, he said, the IOC considered women's boxing to be more popular. Women's boxing has boomed in Britain since 2005, with the number of registered female fighters rising from 50 to 600, PA reported. Softball and baseball were considered for inclusion in the 2016 Games along with squash, karate, roller sports, golf and rugby, but the board decided to consider only the last two. Blog: IOC has picked the wrong sports, says CNN's Paul Gittings . The IOC has not yet selected the host city for 2016, but its board members will submit golf and rugby to the full IOC session for a final decision at its meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark, in October. "Golf and rugby scored high on all the criteria," Rogge told the IOC's official Web site. "They have global appeal, a geographically diverse line-up of top iconic athletes and an ethic that stresses fair play." The International Golf Federation has proposed two four-day strokeplay tournaments for men and women, with 18 holes per round and medals awarded to the three players in each with the lowest scores. The International Rugby Board has proposed men's and women's Sevens tournaments, with 12 teams in each being divided into two pools before semifinals and finals.

chatgpt: In a historic move for women in sports, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has announced that women's boxing will finally be included in the 2012 Olympic Games in London. This means that for the first time ever, female boxers will be competing alongside their male counterparts for Olympic gold. Up until now, boxing had been the only Olympic event without any female participants. Critics argued that this was outdated and unfair, pointing to the growing popularity of women's boxing around the world. However, it wasn't until recently that the IOC finally agreed to take action. Female boxers will compete in three weight categories: flyweight (48-51kg), lightweight (56-60kg) and middleweight (69-75kg). This will provide a platform for a number of talented female boxers to showcase their skills, and will hopefully inspire more young girls to take up the sport. But boxing isn't the only sport to be considered for inclusion in the Olympics. The IOC is also looking at golf and rugby for the 2016 Summer Games. Both sports have a strong international following, and many believe that they would be a great addition to the Olympic lineup. However, not all sports were so lucky. Softball, squash, baseball, karate and roller sports were all rejected for inclusion in the Olympics. This comes as a disappointment to many athletes and fans of these sports, who had been hoping for their chance to compete on the world stage. Softball, in particular, has a strong case for inclusion. The sport has a large following in many countries, including the United States and Japan, and has been part of the Olympics before. However, the IOC has cited concerns over the lack of global participation as a reason for its exclusion. Similarly, squash and karate have both been seeking Olympic inclusion for years. Squash is played in over 185 countries and has a strong following in many Commonwealth nations, while karate is practiced by millions of people around the world. However, the IOC has yet to be convinced of their Olympic appeal. Whether these sports will ever be included in the Olympics remains to be seen. However, for now, the focus is on women's boxing and the groundbreaking role it will play in the 2012 London Games. With this announcement, the IOC has taken a big step towards gender equality in sports, and has shown its commitment to creating a level playing field for all athletes.
