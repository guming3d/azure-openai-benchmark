article: The family of a Texas convict executed for the deaths of his three daughters in a 1991 fire launched a new effort to clear his name Wednesday by asking the state parole board for a posthumous pardon. Cameron Todd Willingham was put to death in 2004 for setting the fire that killed the girls: Amber, Karmon and Kameron. But three expert reviews have concluded Willingham's conviction was based on evidence of arson that was outdated, and his family has insisted on his innocence. "An error was made, and it is not too late to clear it up," the family's lawyers wrote in a petition filed with the state Board of Pardons and Paroles in Austin. Willingham and his family "deserve more," and "perhaps more importantly, the State of Texas deserves more." Junk science? Inmates fight to disprove arson . The board denied clemency for Willingham before his execution, dismissing the first of three reviews that questioned the arson finding at the heart of Willingham's prosecution. Two subsequent studies have reached the same conclusion, finding that most of the signs investigators looked for as proof the fire was deliberately set had been rendered obsolete by a series of studies in the 1990s. The last study was produced for the Texas Forensic Science Commission, which began looking into the Willingham case in 2008. A subsequent shakeup of the commission by Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who allowed Willingham's execution to go forward, led to accusations that the governor was trying to derail the investigation. Perry has called Willingham a "monster" whose conviction withstood every appeal. Police and prosecutors in Corsicana, where the fire occurred, also stand by their case. Willingham professed his innocence in his final statement, but his ex-wife has said he confessed to killing the girls before the execution. A jailhouse informant who testified in his trial has recanted his statement that Willingham admitted to setting the fire, and a now-retired judge who sat on the state court that rejected Willingham's appeal has written that the execution was "a miscarriage of justice" for which he was partly responsible, the family noted in its petition. The Forensic Science Commission's investigation effectively ended in 2011, when a state attorney general's opinion sharply restricted the panel's jurisdiction. Goldstein said going to the pardons board -- whose members are Perry appointees -- was "one of the last resorts" the family has, but added, "This is about righting a wrong." "This isn't about finger-pointing. It's not about blaming anyone. It's about giving a man his good name back," he said. "He died with little else but his name, and we took that from him." Harry Battson, a spokesman for the pardons board, said the agency's staff will review the petition, notifying trial officials and surviving victims and preparing a file for board members. Applications typically take three to four months to process, he said. Film questions Texas death penalty arson case .

chatgpt: The case of Cameron Todd Willingham, who was executed in 2004 in Texas, continues to draw attention and controversy. Willingham was convicted of setting a fire in his home that killed his three young daughters in 1991. However, fire experts have since cast doubt on the prosecution's case, stating that there was no evidence to suggest that Willingham had started the fire. Willingham's family has been fighting for justice for years, and they are now asking the state parole board for a posthumous pardon. They argue that Willingham was wrongfully convicted and that the evidence used to secure his conviction was flawed. The family has also pointed to a report issued by the Texas Forensic Science Commission in 2011, which concluded that the arson investigation used to convict Willingham was based on outdated and faulty science. Despite these claims, prosecutors continue to insist on Willingham's guilt. They argue that the evidence against him was strong enough to warrant his conviction and execution. Some have also accused the family of continuing to fight the case to protect Willingham's legacy, rather than seeking justice for the deaths of his daughters. The case has also attracted the attention of politicians, including former Texas Governor Rick Perry, who oversaw Willingham's execution. Perry has called Willingham a "monster" and defended the state's decision to put him to death. However, some have criticized Perry for ignoring the evidence that suggests Willingham may have been innocent. The debate over Willingham's guilt or innocence is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon. However, the case has had a significant impact on the way that arson investigations are conducted in Texas and other states. In 2013, Texas passed a law allowing prisoners to introduce new evidence in cases where scientific evidence used to secure their conviction has since been discredited. The Willingham case is not the only high-profile case of a potentially innocent person being executed in Texas. In 2000, Gary Graham was put to death despite claims that he had been wrongly convicted of murder. His case drew national attention and sparked calls for a moratorium on the death penalty in Texas. The controversy over the use of the death penalty in Texas and in other states continues to rage on. Critics argue that it is a barbaric and inhumane practice that is prone to error and bias. Supporters, however, argue that it is a necessary deterrent against the most heinous crimes. As for Cameron Todd Willingham, his family continues to fight for his posthumous pardon. They argue that he deserves to be exonerated and that his wrongful conviction and execution serve as a warning against the dangers of a flawed justice system. Whether or not their efforts will be successful remains to be seen.
