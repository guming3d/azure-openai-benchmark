article: (CNN) -- David Beckham is planning showdown talks with L.A. Galaxy teammate Landon Donovan, who questioned the English football star's commitment to the MLS team earlier this month. Landon Donovan, left, is unhappy with David Beckham's contribution at LA Galaxy. Beckham said the U.S. national captain was "unprofessional" for publicly voicing his opinions, which were reported worldwide from the soon-to-be-published book "The Beckham Experiment" by Sports Illustrated writer Grant Wahl. "In every football player's eyes throughout the world, it would be unprofessional to speak out about a team-mate, especially in the press and not to your face," Beckham said before watching the Galaxy's 1-0 win over Chivas USA on Saturday night. What do you think? Was Donovan right? "In 17 years, I have played with the biggest teams in the world and the biggest players, and not once have I been criticized for my professionalism. "It's important to get this cleared up, and I will be speaking to Landon either this evening or over the next couple of days. Me and Landon will talk, but that will be a private conversation." Donovan, who led the United States to the Confederations Cup final last month, said in the book that Beckham had been a negative influence since his high-profile move to the Major League Soccer outfit two years ago. He said Beckham, who brokered a loan move to AC Milan last season, had shown little interest in the Galaxy since coach Ruud Gullit resigned in August last year. Donovan, who leads the Galaxy in Beckham's absence, also cast doubt on the 34-year-old midfielder's leadership abilities. But last week he admitted that he should have brought up his grievances with Beckham earlier. "I don't apologize for what I said," Donovan told MLSnet.com on Thursday. "I just apologize for the way I did. I should have told him to his face. I've long told David since he's been gone and I've been gone that I want to sit down and talk with him about everything. "It's fresh in everyone's minds now, and it appears like everything has gone on in a short period of time, but this has been a long time coming. The timing of it makes it a little awkward and seemingly uncomfortable, but we'll be fine. We'll get through it. "I like David as a person and I think he's a very good player. The frustrating part was at some point something happened and he seemingly turned off at the end of the year. "Nobody knows what it was, and my fault is I should have asked him and approached him and I didn't. Instead I vented to a reporter, and I regret it."

chatgpt: Former England captain and current L.A. Galaxy player David Beckham has revealed that he plans to meet with his teammate Landon Donovan after the U.S. captain accused Beckham of not being fully committed to the MLS team. Donovan made the comments during an interview with a British newspaper, claiming that Beckham's loan spell in Italy with AC Milan meant that he wasn't fully focused on the Galaxy. Beckham has since hit back, labelling Donovan's comments as "unprofessional" and stating his commitment to the Galaxy. The midfielder has recently returned from his loan spell in Italy and is keen to help the Galaxy succeed this season. In a statement released by Beckham's representatives, he said: "I am committed to the L.A. Galaxy and to helping them achieve success this season. I have always given my all for this team and will continue to do so." Despite Donovan's criticism, Beckham's time in Italy proved successful as he helped AC Milan secure a Champions League spot for this season. However, he is now focused on his return to the Galaxy and helping them achieve their goals. Beckham is widely regarded as one of the most successful players in football history and has been a key member of the Galaxy since he joined in 2007. He has helped the team win two MLS Cups and has made over 125 appearances for the club. The meeting between Beckham and Donovan is set to take place in the coming days, with the aim of resolving any issues between the players. Galaxy General Manager and Head Coach Bruce Arena has also spoken out regarding the situation, stating that he expects both players to put aside any differences and work together for the good of the team. "We have a great group of players here at the Galaxy, and we expect them to work together as a team to achieve our goals," Arena said. The Galaxy are currently second in the Western Conference and will be looking to maintain their position as they head into the latter stages of the season. Beckham is expected to play a key role in the team's success, with his experience and leadership skills proving invaluable on the pitch. Overall, while there may be some tension between Beckham and Donovan, it is clear that both players are committed to the success of the Galaxy. The meeting between the two players should bring an end to any dispute and allow them to work together as a team moving forward.
