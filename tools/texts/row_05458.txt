England's Laura Massaro was forced to settle for a silver medal in the women's squash final at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow after a dominant display by Malaysian world number one Nicol David.

The 30-year-old Massaro had made a strong start, building an 8-4 lead in the opener before David hit back, and the favourite surged through the second set with the minimum of difficulty.

There was more pain in the third set for Massaro, who needed treatment after being accidentally hit by a David back-swing when she trailed 4-3. David, who has won seven of the last nine world titles and reigned as world number one for 99 months, took a stroke which put her 5-3 up and it was a lead the Malaysian never looked like relinquishing as she completed a successful defence of her title. Second: Massaro was forced to settle for a silver medal in the women's squash final . Massaro said: 'I think Nicol was better. Obviously she was - she won and I didn't. 'I definitely think the first game was the most crucial and I was disappointed not to convert that game ball that I had. Things like that can turn matches. After that she settled down very well and it was always going to be difficult then. 'Physically and mentally she's tough to break down. You've got no chance if you're not playing the best you could and I wouldn't say I was at my best today (Monday). 'I'm disappointed. It was 3-0 and it wasn't really close after the first game. Ultimately my goal was to try and get a medal and I never put a colour on it. A silver is probably about what I deserved. I'm number two in the world and that performance wasn't good enough for the gold.' Beaten: Massaro plays a shot during her defeat by David in the women's gold medal match .
