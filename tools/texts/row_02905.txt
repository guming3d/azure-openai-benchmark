article: (CNN) -- He played a huge part in propelling Bradley Wiggins to Tour de France glory but now Michael Rogers is in the dock on doping charges. The Australian has been provisionally suspended by the International Cycling Union (UCI) over a sample he gave at a road race in Japan back in October. Rogers, a three-time world road race champion and 2004 Olympic bronze medalist, left Team Sky for Saxo-Tinkoff prior to the start of the 2013 season. The 33-year-old's team claimed the sample collected at the Japan Cup which contained clenbuterol -- that helps build muscle and burn fat -- came from a contaminated food source. News of Rogers' suspension comes just a day after Team Sky rider Jonathan Tiernan-Locke was told he was facing disciplinary proceedings after analysis of his biological passport showed an anti-doping violation. A statement issued by the UCI read: "The UCI advised Australian rider Michael Rogers that he is provisionally suspended. "The decision was made in response to a report from the WADA-accredited laboratory in Tokyo indicating an adverse analytical finding of clenbuterol in a urine sample collected from him in a test during the Japan Cup Cycle Road Race on 20 October 2013. "The provisional suspension of Mr. Michael Rogers remains in force until a hearing panel convened by his national federation determines whether he has committed an anti-doping rule violation under Article 21 of the UCI Anti-Doping Rules." "Mr. Rogers has the right to request and attend the analysis of his B sample." Rogers was a key member of the group that led Wiggins to his maiden Tour de France win in 2012 -- the first ever by a British cyclist. He has been professional since 2001 and landed a bronze medal in the time trial at the Athens Olympics of 2004 when Tyler Hamilton was disqualified. Rogers is a teammate of Alberto Contador at Danish outfit Saxo-Tinkoff. The Spaniard was stripped of his 2010 Tour de France title after testing positive for clenbuterol. Contador fought the ban and took his case to the Court for Arbitration in Sport but failed to overturn his disqualification from the 2010 Tour and a two-year backdated ban. A statement released by Saxo-Tinkoff on Wednesday read: "Michael Rogers immediately informed Saxo-Tinkoff's management about the notification from the UCI. "The Australian explained to the team management that he never ingested the substance knowingly nor deliberately and fears that the adverse analytical finding origins from a contaminated food source." On Tuesday the UCI said British rider Tiernan-Locke, who won the 2012 Tour of Britain, would now be subject to disciplinary proceedings from his national federation after an issue with his biological passport. The 28-year-old vehemently denies any wrong doing while Team Sky said they understood "the violation was highlighted by an anomaly in his Biological Passport, in a reading taken before he signed for this team."

chatgpt: Australian cyclist Michael Rogers has been hit by a provisional suspension by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) on doping charges. The 33-year-old Saxo-Tinkoff rider, who has three world time trial titles to his name, is a former member of Team Sky and was also a key contributor to Bradley Wiggins' Tour de France win in 2012. The UCI announced the suspension on Tuesday and stated that Rogers had tested positive for clenbuterol, a banned substance, at the Tour of Japan in October. However, it is important to note that Rogers has not yet been found guilty of any wrongdoing, and he will have the opportunity to challenge the provisional suspension. Rogers issued a statement in which he expressed his surprise and disappointment at the allegations, and he vowed to do everything in his power to prove his innocence. "I am shocked and devastated by the allegations made against me, and I would like to stress that I have never knowingly taken any banned substance," he said. Meanwhile, another member of Team Sky, Jonathan Tiernan-Locke, is facing disciplinary proceedings on doping charges. The 29-year-old British rider has been accused of taking irregularities in his biological passport, and he will face a hearing with the UCI on December 16. In a statement, Team Sky said that they were "disappointed" by the allegations made against Tiernan-Locke, but that they would continue to cooperate fully with the UCI investigation. "We understand that this is a difficult time for Jonathan and we will continue to support him as best we can," the statement read. These latest allegations against Rogers and Tiernan-Locke are a blow to the sport of cycling, which has been plagued by doping scandals in recent years. The UCI has been under pressure to tackle the issue, and it has introduced a number of measures aimed at catching and punishing those who cheat. The UCI's biological passport program, which monitors riders' blood values for signs of doping, has been instrumental in catching several high-profile cheats in recent years. However, questions remain about the effectiveness of the program, and some riders and experts have called for more stringent testing procedures. Cycling fans will be hoping that the sport can emerge from this latest scandal intact, and that the UCI's efforts to clean up the sport will be successful. However, given the history of doping in cycling, many fans will remain skeptical until there is clear evidence that the sport has truly turned a corner. For now, Rogers and Tiernan-Locke will have to wait for the outcome of their respective hearings with the UCI. The sport of cycling will be hoping that justice is served, and that these latest allegations will not tarnish the reputation of the sport any further.
