article: Kellie Maloney has announced she is planning to return to boxing by taking on fighters with a new management company. Maloney is undergoing gender reassignment, and once that is complete she hopes to resume a career that saw Lennox Lewis shepherded to world heavyweight titles in the 1990s. Maloney, under her previous name Frank, called time on a 30-year career in October 2013, handing back licences to the British Boxing Board of Control after growing disillusioned with the sport. Kellie Maloney has revealed her ambition to return as a boxing promoter in 2015 after gender reassignment . Along with Lewis, Maloney also took the likes of Paul Ingle and Scott Harrison to world titles. She told the Daily Telegraph: 'I haven't really done anything for 18 months other than concentrate on my gender reassignment. I'm actually missing being out there in the real world. I've got a lot of talks lined up to do - talking and diversity meetings, which I enjoy. 'But my biggest love is sports. I'm forming a sports management company, which we'll be announcing in the new year, and part of me wants to go back into boxing. 'I've consulted a couple of promoters, one British based and one European based. Part of me wants to go back and start again as Kellie Maloney because I've always been the underdog in boxing. I've always been fighting the establishment. That's part of my make-up. 'If I was to succeed this time, it would be bigger than taking Lennox Lewis to the heavyweight title. I'm meeting my family in the new year and we'll sit down and talk about it. Some of my family like the idea and some don't like the stress and pressure it brings. As it stands, I'm leaning towards going back into boxing unless something drastic happens in the new year.' The 61-year-old added: 'I want to know how the fans would take to it as well. That's also important to me. I don't want to be insulted. I want to walk into the arena and be given the respect and credit I deserve.'

chatgpt: Kellie Maloney, formerly known as Frank, is undergoing gender reassignment, marking a major shift in the former boxing promoter's life. Maloney decided to retire from the sport in October 2013, after becoming disillusioned with the boxing world. Over the course of her 30-year career, Maloney was a prominent figure in the sport, promoting some of the greatest fighters of her time, including Lennox Lewis, Paul Ingle, and Scott Harrison. She was instrumental in helping these fighters achieve international recognition and world titles. Maloney's decision to transition from male to female has been met with mixed reactions from the public. Some have expressed support for her brave decision to live openly and honestly, while others have criticized her for turning her back on the sport that made her famous. Despite these differing opinions, Maloney remains optimistic about her future. She recognizes that her journey will not be easy, but she is determined to stay true to herself and embrace her newfound identity. In an interview with a local news outlet, Maloney spoke candidly about her experiences, saying, "I know I might lose a few friends along the way, but I am ready for that. I know who I am, and the people who matter will stand by me no matter what." Maloney's decision to undergo gender reassignment is an incredibly brave and courageous one. It takes a tremendous amount of strength to stand up to the world and declare oneself as they truly are. And while there may be challenges ahead for Maloney, she is determined to face them head-on and live her life to the fullest. We can only hope that the public will respond with the kindness and respect that Maloney deserves. And we wish her all the happiness and success in her future endeavors, whatever they may be.
