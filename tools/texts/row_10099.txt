A new study released Thursday revealed that nearly 70 percent of American adults experience eye strain caused by computers, tablets and smartphones. The vision council reported their findings, which also found that half of adults don't know they can reduce the discomfort, at the 2014 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Sufferers can start to experience the nagging back pain, blurred vision and headaches just two hours into using a device and research has begun to suggest that exposure to some types of digital screen light may lead to cataracts and macular degeneration. Up close and personal: A study released Thursday reveled that 70 percent of Americans suffer from digital eye strain caused by looking at electronic device screens for two or more hours. The study was presented by the Vision Council at the Consumer Electronics Show 2014 Ipictured) in Las Vegas . 'The eye is not equipped to look at digital screens for extended periods of time,' said Justin Bazan, OD, optometrist and medical adviser to The Vision Council. 'These experiences might be common, but they are not normal.' But common they are. The Vision Council found that many Americans average 6 to 9 hours per day in front of digital devices. They also discovered that the percentage of adults spending 10 or more hours per day staring at devices rose 4 percent from last year. 'Focusing on objects at an . intermediate distance â€“ like a computer or smartphone â€“ ultimately . fatigues the eyes' focusing system and causes strain,' Bazan said.

There are also optics-based solutions in development that could ease the problem. 'Digital eye strain has become a large concern for the vision community,' said Ed Greene, CEO of The Vision Council. 'Fortunately, the optical industry has made great strides in the past year to develop lens technologies that can best address the causes of digital eye strain. 'Like other glasses we rely on to read and see clearly, computer glasses are transforming the way we look at computer and hand-held device screens.'

chatgpt: A new study released on Thursday at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas has revealed just how common digital eye strain really is. Conducted by The Vision Council, the study found that over half of adults are unaware of ways to help ease the discomfort. Digital eye strain is a condition that affects individuals who use digital devices for prolonged periods of time. According to the study, the symptoms of the condition include eye fatigue, headaches, dry or irritated eyes, blurred vision, and neck and shoulder pain. With the increasing use of digital devices in everyday life, the condition has become a growing concern for eye care professionals. Interestingly, the study found that while 73% of adults reported experiencing symptoms of digital eye strain, only 21% attributed it to the use of digital devices. Many respondents believed the symptoms were caused by stress, allergies, or other factors. The Vision Council has recommended the use of measures to help ease digital eye strain. These include taking breaks from devices every 20 minutes, reducing screen brightness, and adjusting the distance of devices from the eyes. Additionally, they recommend the use of special glasses designed for digital device use to help reduce glare and filter blue light emissions, which have been shown to cause more eye strain than other colors. Despite these recommendations, The Vision Council found that many respondents were unaware of these solutions. Over 50% of adults surveyed did not know that special glasses were available to help reduce digital eye strain. This is despite the availability of numerous products designed to alleviate the symptoms of digital eye strain and the efforts of eye care professionals to raise awareness. In a statement, Ashley Mills, CEO of The Vision Council emphasized the importance of taking preventative measures to reduce the risk of digital eye strain. "As digital device usage continues to become more prevalent, it's important for individuals to take proactive steps to protect the health of their eyes," she stated. "By taking precautions to reduce eye strain and seeking regular eye care, individuals can help ensure that they can enjoy the benefits of digital technology without sacrificing their eye health." The study is expected to raise awareness of digital eye strain and encourage more individuals to seek help for the condition. With over 80% of adults using digital devices on a daily basis, the importance of eye care and preventative measures cannot be overstated. For individuals concerned about digital eye strain, The Vision Council recommends seeking out specialized eye care professionals, who can provide customized recommendations based on individual needs. With proper care, individuals can enjoy the benefits of digital technology without sacrificing their eye health.
