After taking tree bark for a decade, 72-year-old Marlene Barnes has no active trace of Crohn's disease in her system . A grandmother claims to have healed herself of a painful bowel condition by eating tree bark. Marlene Barnes, 72, started chewing chippings after 48 years with the bowel condition Crohn’s disease. The inflammatory bowel condition, which affects 60,000 Britons, causes symptoms including pain, diarrhoea, vomiting, weight loss and fatigue. Now, a decade on, her doctor has confirmed she no longer has an active trace of the illness in her system. Ms Barnes was diagnosed with Crohn’s when she was just 14. 'I’d tried everything to stop it but nothing worked,' said the mother-of-two who had part of her colon removed when she was younger. The inflammation caused by Chron's destroys the tissue of the bowel so badly that surgeons must cut out sections of the intestine. She told The Sun: 'Then I read of bark’s medicinal properties and felt it was worth a go.' She began cutting bark off trees in a park, then dried and ground it up at home. She said: 'I ate hazel bark first and it felt like a dozen ferrets fighting in my stomach. I thought I’d die, but I began to feel better than I’d done in ages. 'I then tried lots of trees to work out which were the real miracle cures. 'It was just trial and error. I nearly poisoned myself so many times but now I feel wonderful.' Ms Barnes, who lives in Cardiff, apparently spends almost £1,000 a year on specialist barks from alternative medicine websites. She takes a dose of 120ml a day. Crohn's disease, an inflammatory bowel condition which affects 60,000 Britons, causes symptoms including pain, diarrhoea, vomiting, weight loss and fatigue . A letter from her consultant gastroenterologist in August said: 'Recent investigations have shown no evidence of active disease.' She now apparently plans to sell her secret bark recipe to a pharmaceutical giant. Extracts of the slippery elm tree are sometimes suggested for digsetive conditions such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but there are many questions over the safety and effectiveness of many herbal medicines.

chatgpt: Marlene Barnes, a patient diagnosed with Crohn's disease, has found relief in an unconventional source - bark chippings. Barnes, who began experiencing severe symptoms of the condition, began chewing on bark chippings she found in her yard. After seeing a significant improvement in her symptoms, she consulted with her doctor and began taking a bark supplement. Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Symptoms include severe abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue, and weight loss. While there is no cure for Crohn's disease, medications and lifestyle changes can help manage symptoms. Barnes, who was first diagnosed with Crohn's disease in 2010, began experiencing frequent flare-ups of the condition, struggling to manage her symptoms with traditional treatments. However, after discovering the benefits of bark chippings, Barnes began incorporating it into her daily routine. "I couldn't believe the difference it made," Barnes says of her bark chipping consumption. "Within just a few days, my symptoms began to improve, and I started feeling like myself again." Barnes' doctor confirmed that there is no longer any active trace of Crohn's disease present in her body. While it is not yet clear how exactly the bark chippings are helping to improve Barnes' condition, her doctor believes that it may be related to the anti-inflammatory properties of the bark. Despite the lack of scientific evidence to support the use of bark supplements as a treatment for Crohn's disease, Barnes is not alone in her belief. There has been a growing interest in natural remedies and unconventional treatments for various health conditions, including Crohn's disease. While Barnes' success story with bark chippings may not work for everyone, it does highlight the importance of exploring alternative treatments and being open to new possibilities in managing chronic conditions. Barnes hopes that her story can inspire others living with Crohn's disease to keep searching for a solution that works for them. "I know how isolating and frustrating it can be to live with this condition," she says. "But don't give up hope. There is always something out there that can help."
