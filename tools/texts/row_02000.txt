article: (CNN) -- It's the townhouse that twists like a Rubik's cube, to bask in the summer sun and shield itself when winter bites. Welcome to the transforming Sharifi-ha House in Tehran, Iran, where a normally static facade has been replaced by an adaptable, modular living space. Not content with luxury touches including a swimming pool, gym and cinema space, the seven-floor mansion has been designed to incorporate three rotating blocks that turn 90 degrees and transform the interior and exterior space. The design was grounded in need rather than luxury, say Tehran-based studio Next Office, the architects behind the new building. Temperatures in Iran can rise above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) or plummet well below freezing. Traditional Iranian houses cope with these extremes by incorporating an airy living room for summer and a separate, cosy living room for winter months. In the Sharifi-ha -- meaning Sharif's house, after its owner --rooms are transformed at the touch of a button. In the "open" mode, the three blocks pivot outwards on their rotating base, pointing the windowed ends to the sun, which also creates a terrace on each floor. "Closed" mode hides the windows to keep the house warm during Tehran's snowy winters. The original design -- which Alireza Taghaboni, lead designer at Next Office, claims also references traditional Iranian houses -- has earned the firm a nomination at the World Architecture Festival Awards. Inside the house, two basement floors provide fitness facilities and "wellness areas," explains Taghaboni. Above a ground floor garage space and living quarters for a housekeeper, the top four floors comprise the home's communal areas. The two lowest moving "blocks" form a breakfast room and guest bedroom, while the upper block will be an office. Creating the rooms to turn on demand was no easy feat, say the architects. They puzzled over the interior handrails -- eventually redesigning them to fold as the rooms rotated. The turning mechanism for the rooms was, they say, the least of their worries -- the mechanical bases were already in use elsewhere -- as rotating sets in theaters or platforms for cars in showrooms. For the World Architecture Festival Award, the building will now go up against Vietnamese houses styled to become live-in plant pots, a concrete beach hut in Australia designed to withstand northern Queensland's tropical storms, and a Mexican villa that rises tree-like out of above its surrounding vegetation.

chatgpt: Rian, a city in Iran, is home to a newly designed house that has caught the attention of architectural enthusiasts worldwide. The house, called Sharifi-ha, has a unique feature that sets it apart from any other: its rooms rotate. Designed by a team of architects, the Sharifi-ha house has three rooms that can rotate according to the season of the year. The idea behind this design was inspired by traditional Iranian houses that have different living rooms for the two seasons. During the summer months, the three rooms can be rotated to allow for a more open and airy feel, providing ample ventilation to keep the house cool. In the winter months, the rooms can be closed off, creating a cozy atmosphere and making the space more energy-efficient. The rotating rooms are operated through a motorized system that can be controlled remotely, allowing homeowners to easily adjust the configuration of their living space according to their needs. The Sharifi-ha house is not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing. The rotating rooms provide a dynamic visual element, adding to the architectural appeal of the house. The interior design is sleek and modern, featuring a minimalist approach with clean lines and neutral colors. The architects behind the Sharifi-ha house are well-known in the industry for their efforts to push the boundaries of modern architecture. This project is yet another example of their dedication to innovative design and sustainable living. The Sharifi-ha house has gained widespread acclaim, receiving numerous awards and accolades in the field of architecture. It has been featured in publications and exhibits worldwide, attracting visitors from all over who want to experience its unique design firsthand. The rotating rooms of the Sharifi-ha house have set a new standard for innovative design in the architectural world. By combining traditional Iranian design elements with modern technology, the architects have created a space that is not only functional but also beautiful. It is an example of how modern architecture can be used to create sustainable living spaces that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.
