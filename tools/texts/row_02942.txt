article: Mother Nature will test even the most committed voter today, with violent storms expected to lash much of Britain. Forecasters say those voting in the European and local elections are likely to be battered by thunder and torrential rain on their way to the polling stations. A severe weather warning is in place across the South where up to 1.5 inches of rain could fall within a matter of hours. After the hottest day of the year on Monday, there will be thundery showers across the country tomorrow . The Environment agency has eight flood warnings in place across the same region, including in areas still at risk as a result of the winter storms. After the weekend’s scorching weather and the hottest day of the year on Monday, the unpredictable British weather will see dark, oppressive clouds move up from the south this morning. Heavy downpours are expected almost everywhere, with most parts of the country at risk of thunderstorms later today. Met Office forecaster Emma Sharples said: ‘Heavy rain has moved up from the south overnight and by 9am it will be over the north of England and Wales – though there will still be thundery showers over the south as well. ‘It has been caused by weather fronts that have started to move in from the south and the west, which have combined with low pressure and the warm temperatures over the continent. ‘The the rest of the week will remain fairly unsettled. This means there will continue to be some heavy showers, and we could still see some thunder during the weekend.’ Downpours come after spectacular lightning lit up the skies off the cost of the Isle of Wight yesterday . The rain comes after Britons basked in  the hottest day of the year on Monday  with a high of 26.3C (79.3F) recorded at  Heathrow Airport. The Environment Agency has warned the stormy weather could lead to localised flooding with the potential to disrupt travel. Eight flood alerts were in place across the South-East last night, with the public body warning of a further low-level risk of flooding across the midlands and southern parts of England and Wales today. A spokesman for the Electoral Commission said last night: ‘The UK weather is notoriously unpredictable and election staff will have plans in place to keep the polling stations open for voters. ‘So if you want to vote, make sure a little thing like the weather doesn’t stop you – but pack a brolly just in case.’
