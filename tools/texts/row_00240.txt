article: Dr Nikki Goldstein says that our busy lives are one of the main reasons why couples end up having less sex and time together . Around 90 per cent of Australian couples are having less sex than when they first met, according to new research. Sexologist Dr Nikki Goldstein told Daily Mail Australia that busy lives are one of the main reasons couples end up having less sex and time together. Couples need to build up their emotional connection and because Australian men are not taught to talk about their emotions it makes it difficult, she said. 'People need to have fun, you need to be able to laugh with your partner to make your sex life better. 'You don’t need to renovate your house into a dungeon into something like out of Fifty Shades of Grey. 'Couples just need to implement one thing into your behaviour to change things. 'Not everyone is going to do a sex tape but it's something different and fun and that is what sex should be about. The emotional connection will grow with communication' she said. The survey revealed that despite 70 per cent of couples still feeling a deep attraction towards one another, they were still unable to have regular intimacy. Dr Goldstein said: 'It is very normal for intimacy to fall by the wayside when life gets busy. 'Time seems to speed up each year with kids at school, long days at work and all of a sudden it has been days, weeks or months since you last shared some alone time with your partner.' The research conducted by Universal Sony Pictures comes as new movie Sex Tape starring Cameron Diaz and Jason Segal releases on DVD. Dr Goldstein said: 'All of a sudden it has been days, weeks or months since you last shared some alone time with your partner' Dr Goldstein says three in five Australians love talking about sex with a third of survey participants admitting to using 'naughty banter' to compare notes with friends. 'We're naturally competitive and it's our instinct to run, out drink and out do one and another, and that extends to the bedroom also,' Dr Goldstein said. She explained that the movie was a good example of how modern day life was getting in the way of people being intimate with their partners. The research is based on theDVD release of Sex Tape starring Cameron Diaz and Jason Segal . Dr Goldstein says the movie is a good example for couples to try and spice up their sex lives . 'I thought it was a really clever an example of what the modern couple is, both of them have careers, have they kids and sex is on the bottom of the list. 'Doing something like a sex tape was that couple's way of trying to get the spark back. 'We have lost the intimacy and we are in this constant fight to want to spice things up.' Sex Tape is released on DVD on November 27.

chatgpt: A recent study conducted among couples across the globe has revealed some interesting insights into the state of their sex lives. According to the results, only one in ten couples are still having as much sex now as they did when they first met. The study surveyed thousands of couples across different age groups and demographics, and found that 70% of them still feel a deep attraction towards each other. However, despite this, the frequency of sexual activity tends to decrease over time. When asked why this might be the case, the answers were varied. Some respondents cited busy and stressful schedules as a hindrance to intimacy, while others pointed to growing responsibilities and changes in priorities. One sex expert notes that, "we have lost the intimacy" in our lives because activities like work and social media have taken over our time and energy. She believes that intimacy is essential for maintaining a healthy sexual relationship, and encourages couples to take the time to connect with each other on a deeper level. Interestingly, the study revealed that Australians over 35 have the biggest appetite for homemade sex tapes. This finding sparked intense discussion and debate online about the risks and rewards of recording intimate moments. While some argued that it can be a fun and exciting way to keep the passion alive, others raised concerns about the potential for these videos to be shared or leaked without consent. Furthermore, the study found that women are generally more hesitant to initiate sex than men, with 50% more women reporting reluctance to take the lead. This statistic raised questions about gender dynamics in the bedroom and the stereotypes and expectations that shape our sexual behavior. Overall, it seems that couples are facing some challenges when it comes to maintaining a healthy and fulfilling sex life. While attraction and desire may still be present, many couples struggle to find the time, energy and intimacy needed to keep the spark alive. The findings of this study have prompted discussions about the importance of communication, connection and trust in relationships. Experts suggest that couples need to prioritize time alone together, and make a conscious effort to build intimacy through activities like cuddling, talking and sharing experiences. As society continues to evolve and change, so do our sexual relationships. However, it is clear that no matter the circumstances, a strong foundation of love, trust and respect is essential for maintaining a satisfying and enjoyable sex life.
