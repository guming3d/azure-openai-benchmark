article: (CNN) -- In something of a surprise move, Apple began selling its new iPad Mini on Tuesday. The small tablet, with a speedier processor and the same high-definition "retina display" as its bigger cousins, is available from Apple's online store and from wireless partners AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon. It's also being sold by selected third-party retailers such as Best Buy. Shoppers cannot buy them yet from Apple retail stores, although they can be picked up at stores after being ordered online. An Apple spokeswoman declined to say when they might become available for in-store purchases. The new Mini's release comes three weeks after Apple introduced the device and 12 days after the new full-size iPad Air went on sale. Many analysts had expected Apple to release the iPad Mini later this month, with speculation focusing on November 22. Apple tends to release new products on Fridays, giving them a full weekend to rack up sales while excitement is high. A product listing on Target's website recently listed the release date for the iPad Mini as November 21, although that date has since been removed. Supplies of the device appear to be limited at first, which may explain why Apple is not selling the new Mini in its stores. As of late morning Tuesday, Apple's online store was listing shipping delays of one to three business days for 16GB and 32GB models and five to 10 business days for models with higher amounts of storage. Early reports also have said Apple is facing a shortage of the Mini's new, high-definition display screens. The new Pad Mini has a 7.9-inch display (compared to 9.7 inches for the full-size iPad) and comes in two colors: silver or space gray. Prices range from $399 for a Wi-Fi-only, 16GB model to $829 for a 128GB model with cellular connectivity.

chatgpt: On Tuesday, Apple fans eagerly awaited the release of the new iPad Mini. However, to their surprise, Apple did not make the new tablet available in their physical stores. Instead, customers can order the device online and pick it up at designated stores, a move that Apple has made in the past with some of its products. The new iPad Mini boasts several impressive features, including its compact size and state-of-the-art processing capabilities. Apple has focused on the device's power, speed, and versatility to compete with other tablets on the market. However, Apple's decision to sell the iPad Mini online only has left some customers feeling frustrated. Apple's online store lists shipping delays, leading many customers to worry that the company may be experiencing supply chain issues. Apple has not commented on any supply chain issues but has urged customers to order early due to the high demand for the tablet, suggesting that supplies may be limited. The new iPad Mini has a starting price of $499, which is in line with other high-end tablets on the market. However, customers who are interested in purchasing the device should be aware that the cost can quickly rise with the addition of storage, cellular connectivity, and other features. Despite the inconvenience of not being able to purchase the iPad Mini in-store, Apple's decision to release the device online only may have some benefits, such as reduced costs associated with overhead and staffing at physical stores. Additionally, the move could help to balance supply and demand for the device, ensuring that customers who want the iPad Mini can purchase it without fear of it selling out. Apple has not released any official sales figures for the new iPad Mini, but it is expected to be a popular product due to its size, power, and versatility. Customers interested in purchasing the device should act quickly to avoid any potential supply chain issues or shipping delays. In conclusion, the new iPad Mini is now available for purchase online only, causing some frustration among Apple fans who prefer to buy their devices in-store. Although shipping delays have been reported, the tablet's popularity is sure to remain high, given its impressive features and competitive pricing.
