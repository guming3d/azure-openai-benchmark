article: A Dutch teen had an epic meltdown after a bomb threat to American Airlines that she claims was a joke was referred to authorities. Twitter user @QueenDemetriax_ begged for forgiveness and to be left alone after sending the threatening tweet Sunday morning and within minutes receiving a reply from the airline saying her IP address had been forwarded to the FBI. She then pleaded with people to stop harassing her while gaining tens of thousands of followers and claiming she ‘blocked the FBI just in case.’ Bad idea: The teen immediately regretted sending this 'joke' bomb threat . Infamy: The girl claimed all she wanted was to be famous, but lamented finding the wrong kind of fame . ‘Hello my name’s Ibrahim and I’m from Afghanistan,’ Sarah wrote Sunday. ‘I’m part of Al Qaida and on June 1st I’m gonna do something really big bye.’ The airline’s reply was brief and to the point. ‘Sarah, we take these threats very seriously. Your IP address and details will be forwarded to security and the FBI.’ The girl then pleaded with the airline, saying she’s only 14-years-old and from the Netherlands, that she’s never been to Afghanistan. ‘What do you want from me?’ She pleaded. It was to no avail, the airline did not reply. It was just a joke: The girl insisted she was joking and not from Afghanistan, but the airline did not reply . Worried: The girl expressed her fear and threw her friend under the bus, anything to avoid being in trouble . Massive following: Her followers shot up over 30,000 by Sunday night . ‘I’m so sorry I’m scared now.’ she wrote. ‘I was joking and it was my friend not me, take her IP address not mine.’ The airline did not reply, but Twitter users did. Her followers shot from a couple thousand to over 30,000 by Sunday night. She took note of the gain in followers. ‘I always wanted to be famous. But I meant like Demi Lovato famous, not Osama bin laden famous,’ she tweeted. Humility: The girl claimed she was too busy flying around in her own jet to blow up a commercial one . Problem solved: Tweet deleted and FBI 'blocked' Both the American Airlines and Sarah’s tweet were eventually deleted, and it is not exactly clear if any call to the FBI was ever made. ‘We took it down basically because it generated a lot of traffic,’ spokeswoman Dori Alvarez told the New York Daily News. ‘We took it down so we could better focus on our customers.’ Twitter spokesperson declined to comment on the matter to the New York Post, but tweeted that ‘only law enforcement can request private information about Twitter accounts.’ Sarah expressed remorse for the stunt, wondering aloud why she did it – but the she wrote ‘I changed my name to Ibrahim.’
highlights: The girl instantly gained 30,000 followers and became the talk of Twitter Sunday morning after the joke started trending . It is not clear if authorities will actually get involved after both her tweet and American Airlines' response have since been deleted .

chatgpt: A teenage girl, who took to Twitter to play a practical joke on American Airlines, found herself gaining unexpected Internet fame. The girl, whose name has not been released, posted a tweet on Saturday which read, "hello, my name's Ibrahim and I'm from Afghanistan. I'm part of Al Qaida and on June 1st I'm gonna do something really big bye."  The tweet, which was intended as a joke according to the girl, quickly went viral and gained over 30,000 followers. Many took to social media to express their concern for safety, while others condemned the girl for making a joke about terrorism. The tweet became one of the top trending topics on Twitter and caused quite a stir before it was taken down. Following the tweet and the online backlash, American Airlines responded to the girl's tweet stating that they had forwarded her details to the FBI. The response did little to calm down the frenzy that had been sparked online. It is not clear whether the authorities will take any action against the girl. However, the girl has since issued an apology via her Twitter account. She revealed that the tweet was meant to be a prank and that she never intended to cause any harm. She also stated that she hoped people would understand that it was meant to be a joke and that she is sorry if she caused any fear or concern. Social media is now abuzz with discussions about the incident with some praising her for her sense of humor, while others criticize her for making light of a serious issue. Many are also questioning whether the authorities will actually take any action against her. Some are calling for her to be punished, while others say she should be left alone. This incident highlights the increasing power and influence of social media. With the click of a button, one tweet can spread like wildfire and cause a major shockwave. It also highlights the importance of being mindful about what we post online. While the girl's tweet may have been intended as a joke, it caused real concern and fear for many people. The fact that American Airlines felt compelled to involve the FBI speaks volumes about the seriousness of the situation. In recent years, there have been several high-profile cases of people being prosecuted for posting threatening or offensive messages online. While it remains to be seen whether the girl in this case will face any legal consequences, it serves as a reminder to others that the Internet can be a powerful and dangerous tool if not used responsibly. In conclusion, the girl's tweet sparked a storm of controversy and put her at the center of a heated debate. While many people found her joke in poor taste, others defended her right to free speech. Regardless of whether the authorities get involved, this incident provides an important lesson for us all about the power of social media and the need to use it responsibly.
