chatgpt: Ronnie 'Jay' Adrian Towns, 28, has handed himself in after the disappearance of Bud and June Runion, a couple in their late 60s, who were last seen on Thursday evening. The Runions had driven to McRae, Georgia to meet someone who had responded to Bud's ad seeking a 1966 Mustang. However, they never made it back home and their daughters became concerned when they didn't show up to babysit and didn't answer their cell phones. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation has been working on the case since the disappearance of the couple. They released a statement saying, "We are aware that Mr. Towns has turned himself in to the authorities. We will continue our investigation to determine the circumstances surrounding the Runions' disappearance." It's worth noting that Towns had not been accused of harming the Runions before his surrender.
