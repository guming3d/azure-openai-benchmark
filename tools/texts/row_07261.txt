chatgpt: Real Madrid’s newest midfielder, Toni Kroos, has stated that winning trophies is his main objective in joining the club. The World Cup winner was unveiled yesterday at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium, where he expressed his enthusiasm for joining one of the biggest clubs in world football. Kroos, 24, has come from Bayern Munich, the team he helped to win the domestic league and cup double last season, as well as the 2013 Champions League title. Despite his success at Bayern, Kroos acknowledges the step up he has taken by joining Real Madrid. "I had three wonderful years with Bayern," Kroos told reporters. "But I think this is a good step for me, because Real Madrid is one of the best clubs in the world, if not the best. I want to be part of this success story and help the team win more trophies." Kroos’ move to Real Madrid has been rumoured for several months, with the Spanish club reportedly paying €25m for the German midfielder’s services. His signing is seen as a coup for Real, who are looking to strengthen their midfield following the departure of Xabi Alonso to Bayern Munich earlier this week. "I'm really looking forward to playing with the players here," said Kroos. "This club has a lot of quality and a lot of really good people. I think I can learn a lot from them and they can learn a lot from me as well." Kroos’ arrival at Real Madrid caps off a memorable summer for the midfielder, who helped Germany to their fourth World Cup title in Brazil. He impressed throughout the tournament, scoring two goals and recording four assists, and was named in the team of the tournament by FIFA. Real Madrid president Florentino Perez was also present at the unveiling, and expressed his delight at securing the services of one of the most sought-after midfielders in Europe. "Toni Kroos is one of the best midfielders in the world," said Perez. "He's a World Cup winner, a Champions League winner, and he has a lot of experience at the highest level. We are very happy to welcome him to Real Madrid and we believe he will be a great addition to our team." Kroos’ signing is the latest in a string of high-profile moves by Real Madrid this summer, including the signature of Colombian superstar James Rodriguez from Monaco for €80m. The club already boasts some of the best players in the world, including Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Sergio Ramos, and will be looking to add to their trophy cabinet in the upcoming season. Real Madrid will face Atletico Madrid this week in the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup, and Kroos may be part of the squad for the match. Despite his exciting new challenge, he is keen to focus on the task at hand. "For me, it's important to integrate into the team as quickly as possible and play my part," said Kroos. "I want to help the team in whatever way I can and win as many trophies as possible. That's what it's all about at Real Madrid."
