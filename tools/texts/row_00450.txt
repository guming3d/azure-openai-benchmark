article: The FBI has warned U.S. businesses to be on the alert for a sophisticated Iranian hacking operation whose targets include defense contractors, energy firms and educational institutions, a confidential agency document reveals. The operation is the same as one flagged last week by cyber security firm Cylance Inc as targeting critical infrastructure organizations worldwide, cyber security experts said. Cylance has said it uncovered more than 50 victims from what it dubbed Operation Cleaver, in 16 countries, including the United States. Warning: The FBI has compiled a confidential report on the IP addresses in Iran that could attack the U.S. The FBI's confidential 'Flash' report, seen by Reuters on Friday, provides technical details about malicious software and techniques used in the attacks, along with advice on thwarting the hackers. It asked businesses to contact the FBI if they believed they were victims. Cylance Chief Executive Stuart McClure said the FBI warning suggested that the Iranian hacking campaign may have been larger than its own research revealed. 'It underscores Iran's determination and fixation on large-scale compromise of critical infrastructure,' he said. The FBI's technical document said the hackers typically launch their attacks from two IP addresses that are in Iran, but did not attribute the attacks to the Tehran government. Cylance has said it believes Iran's government is behind the campaign, a claim Iran has vehemently denied. An FBI official did not provide further details, but said the agency routinely provides private industry with advisories to help it fend off cyber threats. The Pentagon and National Security Agency had no immediate comment. Tehran has been substantially increasing investment in its cyber capabilities since 2010, when its nuclear program was hit by the Stuxnet computer virus, widely believed to have been launched by the United States and Israel. Building evidence: It comes after a report found the same Iranian addresses have attacked 50 countries . Cyber security professionals who investigate cyber attacks said that they are seeing evidence that Iran's investment is paying off. 'They are good and have a lot of talent in the country,' said Dave Kennedy, CEO of TrustedSEC LLC. 'They are definitely a serious threat, no question.' Iranian hackers are increasingly being blamed for sophisticated cyberattacks. Bloomberg Businessweek on Thursday reported that Iranian hacker activists were responsible for a devastating February 2014 attack on casino operator Las Vegas Sands Corp, which crippled thousands of servers by wiping them with destructive malware. It said the hackers sought to punish Sands CEO Sheldon Adelson for comments he made about detonating a nuclear bomb in Iran.

chatgpt: According to a confidential safety document seen by our reporters, businesses have been warned to be on the lookout for a potential hack that could originate from Iran. The report, which was issued by the FBI, identifies two IP addresses in the country that the attack is likely to come from. The report comes after last week's revelation that the same IP addresses had targeted 50 countries. The report suggests that the situation is more widespread than previously thought, and that businesses in all sectors could be at risk. The FBI has urged businesses to be vigilant and to take all necessary precautions to safeguard their data and networks. Although the FBI has not provided details about the nature of the attack, it is believed that it could be a sophisticated cyber attack that targets critical infrastructure, such as banking and healthcare systems. The FBI has warned that the attack could have serious consequences for businesses and the wider economy. The report is the latest indication that cyber threats are becoming more frequent and sophisticated, and that businesses need to take proactive steps to defend themselves. Cybersecurity experts have advised businesses to implement strong security protocols, such as multi-factor authentication and encryption, to protect their networks and data. The FBI has also advised businesses to be on the lookout for suspicious activity on their networks, such as unusual login attempts or unusual outbound traffic. Businesses should also ensure that they have up-to-date anti-virus software and firewalls in place. The report comes at a time when cyber-attacks are on the rise, with businesses of all sizes and sectors being targeted by cyber criminals. In recent years we have seen a rise in ransomware attacks, where businesses are locked out of their systems until they pay a ransom, as well as data breaches where sensitive information is stolen. The FBI and other government agencies around the world are taking steps to combat cyber threats, including increasing funding for cybersecurity research and legislation to improve cybersecurity standards. However, businesses also have a role to play in defending themselves against cyber threats. The FBI has urged businesses to report any suspicious activity to their local authorities, so that they can take appropriate action. Businesses should also take the time to educate their employees about cyber threats, and provide them with training on cybersecurity best practices. In conclusion, the FBI's warning about a potential hack originating from Iran is a reminder that businesses need to take cyber threats seriously and take all necessary precautions to safeguard their data and networks. Businesses that fail to take these steps are putting themselves at risk of serious consequences.
