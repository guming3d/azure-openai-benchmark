article: (EW.com) -- Man, you give the guy a seat on the "America's Got Talent" judging panel and suddenly, he thinks he should take over everything. On his radio show this morning on Sirius XM, Stern casually mentioned how he's going to "take over The Tonight Show" when addressing the public drubbing that Matt Lauer has received over Ann Curry's departure last summer. Stern also refers to how Bob Greenblatt â€” NBC's Entertainment Chairman â€” told him how he's "got to take over the show." (To hear the exchange, click here). An insider told EW that no such talks are happening â€” which makes sense, considering how Leno continues to dominate at 11:30 p.m. During the February sweeps, The Tonight Show beat Jimmy Kimmel Live and The Late Show with David Letterman among adults 18-49 (1.003 million versus Letterman's 920,000 and Kimmel's 898,000) and attracted a bigger audience (3.5 million viewers versus Letterman's 3.2 million and Kimmel's 2.5 million). Still, rumors persist about a possible succession plan in 2014 that would involve Jimmy Fallon assuming the 11:30 p.m. time slot. 'Enlightened' canceled by HBO . Stern likes to talk trash about Leno. Last August, Stern claimed that reports about Leno taking a pay cut to limit staff reductions was not the entire truth. "Jay wanted to cut staff. He's embarrassed to do it. He didn't want to come off as a bad guy. NBC took the hit for him, because they're a corporation...My bullsh-t meter is going off all over the place," he said. Stern also said he's been "feuding" with Leno for years. See the original article at EW.com. CLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly . © 2011 Entertainment Weekly and Time Inc.
