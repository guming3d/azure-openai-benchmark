article: The Ice Challenge, played properly, involves no alcohol and proceeds are donated to charities . A man has died of a heart attack after consuming a 1-litre bottle of bourbon and having his head drenched in ice cold water as part of a social media drinking game in New Zealand. Willis Tepania, a 40-year-old father from Kaitaia, took part inÂ the game called the 'ice challenge' on Saturday night, downing a 1-litre of Jim Beam bourbon minutes after having a bucket of ice cold water thrown over her head. The New Zealand Herald has reported he suffered a cardiac arrest five hours after taking part in the now viral drinking phenomenon, which involves participants submerging themselves in ice water or having a bucket poured over their head. They then nominate others to take the challenge and make a donation to charity. But in countless online videos, the exercise is conducted hand-in-hand with alcohol. It is believed Mr Tepania fell asleep soon after his challenge and emergency services were called to to his Kaitaia home to treat him for a heart attack when he woke. Willis Tepania fell asleep for five hours before he woke and died of a heart attack as a result of the Ice Challenge game . A St John spokesman said Mr Tepania was successfully resuscitated by emergency services shortly after 3am on Sunday, and he was rushed to Kaitaia Hospital. 'He was flown to Whangarei Hospital some time later,' the spokesman told the New Zealand Herald. It is understood Mr Tepania died on Monday night. A grieving family member has warned others choosing to take part in the ice challenge to eliminate alcohol from the charitable activity. The family member, not named, said those should do it for the 'right reasons.' 'Alcohol has nothing to do with the ice challenge.' Footage of the event was taken but has since been destroyed. It is expected the man's death will be referred to the coroner. Vicki Moses, who started an ice challenge to fundraise for her five-year-old son Austin, also in Kaitaia, said drinking was not necessary. The ice challenge helped raise about $9000 for her son, who was diagnosed with leukemia in February. What started as a nomination for just three people, went viral overnight, she said. She said in the case of Mr Tepania's death, it appeared the challenge had gone too far and that was not what the game was initially intended to achieve. The Cancer Society, which benefits from the ice challenge donations, has also warned against drinking. 'Cancer Society cares about your health and well being and so does not support the consumption of alcohol as part of this challenge,' it says on one of its websites .

chatgpt: A New Zealand man has died after participating in a charity game that had gone viral on social media. The game, called the "Ice Bucket Challenge," involves participants nominating someone to have their head dunked in ice water while donations go to certain charities. Willis Tepania, a 40-year-old man from New Zealand, decided to take part in the Ice Bucket Challenge. However, he made a fatal mistake by drinking excessive amounts of alcohol after completing the challenge. The aftermath of the drinking binge landed him in the hospital the following day, but unfortunately, Tepania died of a heart attack while in the care of the hospital. The social media game has seen widespread participation globally and is designed to bring awareness and funds to certain charities. Participants are encouraged to nominate others to take on the challenge within a set period and, in turn, donate to a charity of their choice. It is unclear what charity Tepania had donated to, but his death has put a damper on the charity challenge, with warnings being issued to participants about the potential dangers of alcohol after completing the challenge. Social media has played a big part in the popularity of the charity game, with participants documenting their experiences through video and pictures online, all in the name of raising awareness for the cause. The Ice Bucket Challenge has been a source of fundraising for various charities, with beneficiaries spanning across the globe. The challenge, which began in the US, has seen the ALS Association receive an influx of donations, which have helped fund research for the treatment of ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) disease. Despite its good intentions, the charity game has seen some criticism for its lack of transparency on where donations go, with some participants suggesting that the initiative endorses a self-serving ideal rather than genuine charitable causes. The death of Tepania, however, has brought to light the dangers of combining alcohol with the challenge. Nominating someone to take on the challenge has been encouraged to prioritize safety, and participants are being advised to keep hydrated and avoid alcohol consumption during and after taking part. The Ice Bucket Challenge has since seen a decrease in popularity since its emergence in 2014, but it is still an online craze that appears on timelines from time to time. Unfortunately, in Tepania's case, the fun and games ended in tragedy. The family and loved ones of the deceased are heartbroken by the loss of their loved one. The charity game-initiative brings awareness to good causes, but participants must be mindful of the risks associated with it. The Ice Bucket Challenge is undoubtedly unique, but safety and responsibility should take precedence to turn it into a full-fledged campaign.
