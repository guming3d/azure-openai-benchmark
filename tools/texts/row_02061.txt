article: (CNN) -- Japan was hit by record snowfall again this weekend as several prefectures in the eastern part of the country reported deaths as well as severe transport delays and disruptions. The Japan Fire and Disaster Management Agency has confirmed at least 19 deaths caused by the snowstorm across northeast Japan. At least 365 are reported to be injured from incidents caused directly by the heavy snow. Elderly residents in Oyama in Shizuoka Prefecture were stranded in their homes following a snow dump of more than three feet (1 meter) on Friday. Other isolated communities were also cut off, with more than 5,000 households inaccessible due to blocked roads in some mountainous areas of Yamanashi, Nagano, Saitama and Gunma prefectures as well as western Tokyo, according to the Cabinet Office. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe set up emergency disaster task force to deal with the damage caused by the snow fall, according to his office. On Tuesday morning he ordered the relevant government departments to take all possible measures to avoid "anybody freez[ing] to the death due to the isolation" and to make the utmost effort "to restore lifelines and clear the roads" in those areas which are cut off. Tokyo experienced just under a foot (27cm) of snow over the weekend, days after the capital had experienced its heaviest snowfall in decades. A highway connecting Gunma and Nagano prefectures was closed, stranding hundreds of drivers, and the national broadcaster NHK said over 600 flights, mostly domestic, across the country were also canceled. Police said building collapses accounted for several fatalities, while in Yamanashi prefecture two men froze to death in separate incidents while trying to walk home from stranded cars. A commuter train collision at a station on the outskirts of Tokyo was also attributed to the snow by railway operator Tokyu Corp. Around 20 passengers were left with minor injuries in the incident. The Japan Meteorological Agency has raised advisories for much of the country, and with the storm heading northwards, sections of northern island of Hokkaido have been placed under warning of heavy snowfall and avalanches.

chatgpt: The death toll from the recent snowstorm in Japan has reached 19, as the country struggles to cope with the aftermath of one of the heaviest snowfalls in decades. Heavy snowfall caused major transport disruptions in several parts of the country, adding to the misery of millions of people already struggling to deal with the effects of the pandemic. According to local authorities, at least 19 people have lost their lives due to the severe weather conditions. The latest snowstorm arrived just days after a previous one, which brought the heaviest snowfall in decades to parts of Japan. The continuous snowfall has caused widespread damage and disruption, with many roads and railways blocked by heavy snow and ice. The government and emergency services have been working hard to clear the snow, but many areas remain cut off from the rest of the country. Airports have been closed, and train services have been severely impacted, with many cancellations and delays. The Japanese Self-Defense Forces have also been deployed for relief operations in some of the worst-affected areas. While the transport disruptions continue to be a major issue, the snow also poses a significant risk to public safety, with hundreds of people injured due to slip-and-fall accidents. According to reports, around 365 people have been injured across the country due to the heavy snowfall. The snow has also caused damage to buildings and infrastructure, with several homes, shops, and public buildings collapsing under the weight of the snow. The government has urged residents and businesses to take all necessary measures to safeguard their properties and ensure their safety. The snowfall has caused a lot of stress and anxiety among the Japanese people, who are already grappling with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many residents are struggling with power outages, food shortages, and other issues, and the snowstorm has only added to their difficulties. The government has announced a relief package to help those affected by the snowstorm, including cash handouts and other forms of assistance. However, many people are still struggling to cope with the aftermath of the disaster, and the government and emergency services are doing all they can to support them. In conclusion, the severe snowstorm in Japan has had a devastating impact on the country, with many lives lost and widespread damage to infrastructure and property. The ongoing transport disruptions and slip-and-fall accidents continue to pose a grave risk to public safety, and the government and emergency services are working hard to minimize the damage caused by the disaster. The people of Japan are facing a challenging time, and the government's relief efforts are crucial in helping them overcome this crisis.
