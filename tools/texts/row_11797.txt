He is scheduled to appear in U.S. District Court in Boston on Friday afternoon. Matanov knew Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, and in the days after the April 2013 bombings that killed three people and injured more than 260, Matanov realized the FBI would want to talk with him because he shared their 'philosophical justification for violence,' prosecutors said. He talked to the brothers on numerous occasions after the bombings, and even took them out to dinner the day of the explosions, they said. 'In the days following the bombings, Matanov continued to express support for the bombings, although later that week he said that maybe the bombings were wrong,' the indictment said.

chatgpt: A 23-year-old man from Quincy, Massachusetts, has been accused of tampering with evidence and lying to federal investigators regarding his relationship with the Tsarnaev brothers. Khairullozhon Matanov now faces several charges, including destroying, altering and falsifying documents that could have aided in the investigation of the Boston Marathon bombing in April 2013. Prosecutors allege that Matanov had shared the "philosophical justification for violence" held by Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who were responsible for the bombing that killed three people and injured hundreds. The indictment also stated that Matanov had taken the brothers out for dinner the day after the attack. In addition to these charges, Matanov has been accused of deleting information from his computer that could have been used in the investigation. This includes internet searches, as well as emails and other forms of correspondence. Moreover, prosecutors claim that Matanov repeatedly lied about the extent of his relationship with the Tsarnaev brothers. They argue that he misled investigators for months, denying that he knew anything about the bombing or about the Tsarnaev brothers' involvement. According to court documents, Matanov had called Tamerlan Tsarnaev several times in the aftermath of the bombing. He also admitted to driving the brothers to a train station just days before the bombing. But when confronted by investigators, Matanov downplayed the significance of these interactions, claiming that he was only a casual acquaintance of the brothers. This is not the first time that Matanov has been in trouble with the law. In 2014, he was arrested and charged with one count of lying in a terrorism investigation. After his arrest, he was released on bail and placed under house arrest. Now, with these additional charges, Matanov could face up to 20 years in prison, if convicted. However, his defense attorneys have already identified several weaknesses in the case against him. For example, they argue that the government has no solid evidence to support their claim that Matanov shared the Tsarnaev brothers' views on violence. They also point out that Matanov had no direct involvement in the bombings and did not know about the attack beforehand. Nevertheless, the case against Matanov will likely be closely watched, both for its potential implications for national security and for what it could reveal about the relationship between the Tsarnaev brothers and their acquaintances in the Boston area.
