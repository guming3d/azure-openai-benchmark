Sri Lankan officials claimed both planes were shot down by the Sri Lankan Air Force, SLAF, refuting the Tiger's claim they were conducting suicide missions in the country's capital. A spokesperson for the Sri Lankan Military said the body of a Tamil Tiger guerrilla was found by the plane's wreckage after it was shot down near the Colombo International Airport.

In a report released on Thursday, Human Rights Watch criticized the Sri Lankan government for its "indiscriminate" killings of civilian as it attempts to fight the rebel movement. As the rebel stronghold continues to shrink, civilians are trapped in the cross-fire, HRW said. "Sri Lankan forces are shelling hospitals and so-called safe zones and slaughtering the civilians there," James Ross, legal and policy director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. HRW also condemned the Tamil Tigers for its treatment of civilians. The organization's 45-page study said 2,000 civilians have been killed and another 5,000 have been wounded. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) -- commonly known as the Tamil Tigers -- have fought for an independent homeland for the country's ethnic Tamil minority since 1983. The civil war has left more than 70,000 people dead.

chatgpt: In a new development in the ongoing conflict in Sri Lanka, officials have announced that the country's air force has shot down multiple rebel planes. The news comes as violence continues to escalate in the capital, Colombo, with reports indicating that two people have been killed and 50 more have been wounded. According to officials, the air force targeted the rebel planes as they attempted to carry out attacks on government targets. It is unclear who the rebels were and what their objectives were, but the incident marks a significant escalation in the conflict. Meanwhile, human rights groups are raising concerns about the rise in civilian casualties as a result of the ongoing clashes. In a statement, Human Rights Watch noted that both sides are to blame for the increase in civilian deaths and injuries, and called on both parties to take steps to protect innocent bystanders. Aid groups are also sounding the alarm over the desperate situation faced by civilians caught up in the conflict. Estimates indicate that up to 250,000 people are trapped in the conflict zone, with many lacking access to food, water, and medical supplies. Aid workers are calling for urgent action to ensure that these civilians receive the support they need. The latest incident involving the air force comes amid heightened tension and violence across the country. Despite calls for calm and negotiations to end the conflict, it appears that both sides are digging in and preparing for more fighting. The situation is particularly concerning given that Sri Lanka has a troubled history of conflict and violence. The Tamil Tigers, a rebel group seeking independence for the country's Tamil minority, waged a brutal insurgency against the government for over two decades before being defeated in 2009. Since then, sporadic violence has continued, with both sides accusing the other of human rights abuses. The international community has expressed concern over the escalation in violence and the impact it is having on civilians. Numerous countries have called for an immediate ceasefire and for all parties to engage in meaningful dialogue to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict. As the situation in Sri Lanka continues to deteriorate, it is clear that urgent action is needed to protect civilians and bring an end to the violence. The international community must step up its efforts to support peacebuilding initiatives and help ensure that all parties to the conflict respect human rights and protect innocent civilians.
