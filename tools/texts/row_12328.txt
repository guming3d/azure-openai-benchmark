article: PUBLISHED: 24 May 2012 . This is the shopaholic model who spends £1,000 a week on clothes - and says she cannot stop. Star Thompson, 19, has filled four wardrobes at her home in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, with clothes she has never worn. The teenager hates wearing the same outfit twice - to the point that she will bin socks after wearing them just once. Miss Thompson has a wardrobe stuffed with tops, leggings and shoes. She frequently buys underwear and has amassed more than 200 bras and 15 pairs of £250 Ugg boots. 'A lot of the clothes I do buy, I buy because I like them although I know that I won’t ever wear them,' she said. 'I’ve got to the point where I haven’t got anywhere to put it all and I’m doing three loads of washing each day just to keep it all clean.' Miss Thompson was given £6,000 on her birthday by her family, but she blew £4,000 in just hours, according to the Daily Star. She waded through the rest of her family's money in just days. She added: 'Sometimes I feel guilty because I could be saving or spending on something I actually need, but you only live once.' Retail therapy: Star Thompson is so addicted to buying clothes that she spent £4,000 in just a few hours on her birthday . Compulsive shopping (known as a shopping addiction), is a psychiatric disorder like all other behavioural addictions. Shopping addictions are socially reinforced, however, because consumerism is boosted by advertising, peer pressure and political encouragement to feed the economy. It has become more common in recent years, but was recognised as far back as the early nineteenth century. As with all addictions, shopping becomes the person’s main way of coping with stress, to the point where they continue to shop excessively even when it is clearly having a negative impact on other areas of their life. Finances and relationships are damaged, yet the shopping addict feels unable to stop or even control their spending. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.
