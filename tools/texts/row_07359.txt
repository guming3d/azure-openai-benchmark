article: PUERTO MONTT, Chile (CNN) -- Nearly a week after a volcano erupted in Chaiten, Chile, disgorging its contents across a wide area of the Andes Mountains, authorities finished evacuating the area most affected. Though the eruption has been continuous, it increased at midnight Wednesday, powered by a massive explosion, then returned to its steady discharge of ash, officials said. Overnight, authorities armed with a court order evacuated the last of the holdouts -- many of whom had sought to remain to care for their cattle -- among the approximately 5,000 residents inside the 30-kilometer (18-mile) exclusion zone, said Carmen Fernandez, director of Chile's Office of Emergency. By Thursday morning, about 100 people -- primarily police, military and journalists -- remained in the immediate vicinity of the volcano, she said. In Bariloche, 300 kilometers (186 miles) from the volcano, Chilean Minister of Defense Jose Goni met Thursday with Argentine Vice President Julio Cobos to coordinate the transfer of the cows in the affected zone to Argentine territory, 60 kilometers (37 miles) away. Many of Bariloche's residents clutched handkerchiefs to their faces or wore cloth masks -- handed out by the government -- as they went about their business. Even with the masks, breathing could be difficult. Thick layers of ash covered everything like freshly fallen snow. Bariloche's airport and other regional airports were shut Thursday after satellite photos revealed that the air over the provinces of Buenos Aires, La Pampa, Rio Negro, Neuquen and Chubut was filled with ash. The most dense clouds of the material were seen over Chubut and Rio Negro, with lesser amounts in the other provinces. In all, clouds of ash covered nearly a third of Argentina, the country's meteorological service said. As of noon Thursday, ash could be seen in the sky above Buenos Aires and its suburbs, it said. "The sky appears gray, products of the presence of ashes that are moving from west to east at an altitude of about 3,500 meters," the service said.  Watch volcano eruption » . "Fortunately, the composition of the ash, air and smoke that is coming out of the volcano isn't highly toxic," said Mirta Roses, director of the Pan American Health Organization. But, she said, children, older people and people with allergies or asthma are at highest risk and should make extra efforts to avoid it. Many of the evacuees were taken to Puerto Montt, a port city in southern Chile about 200 kilometers (124 miles) north of Chaiten. The volcano, which is about 1210 kilometers (752 miles) south of the Chilean capital, Santiago, began erupting early Friday, raining gray ash onto Chaiten. The small city is on the Corcovado Gulf, in southern Chile. The volcano last erupted around 7,420 B.C., according to the Smithsonian's Global Volcanism Project. Chile contains a large number of active volcanoes, including Llaima, which erupted in January, sending lava and smoke down a snow-covered mountain.

chatgpt: Approximately 5,000 residents in Argentina have been evacuated from their homes due to a thick cloud of ash covering almost a third of the country. According to officials, some residents were forced to leave due to court orders as the ash has made it impossible for them to stay in their homes safely. The ash is the result of a volcanic eruption from the Puyehue-Cordón Caulle volcanic complex in neighboring Chile. Since the eruption on June 4, 2011, the ash has spread across large parts of Argentina, causing disruptions to regional airports and other transport services. On Thursday, authorities shut down the regional airports after satellite photos showed the air filled with ash. The closure of the airports was a precautionary measure to prevent any accidents due to poor visibility caused by the ash. In addition to the evacuation of residents, authorities have also coordinated the transfer of cows out of the affected zone. Around 60 kilometers of transfer has been arranged to move the cows to safer locations away from the ash. The Argentine meteorological service has stated that the cloud of ash has covered almost a third of the country, and there are concerns that the ash could cause long-term damage to crops and other vegetation in the region. Officials are working to clear the ash from the affected areas, but it is a challenging task due to the sheer amount of ashy material. The ash contains fine particles that can cause respiratory problems and other health issues if inhaled. Therefore, officials are urging people in the affected areas to stay indoors and limit their exposure to the ash. The situation has caused significant disruptions to the daily life of people in the affected areas. Schools and businesses have been forced to close, and roads have become difficult to navigate as the ash has made it challenging to drive safely. The eruption of the Puyehue-Cordón Caulle volcanic complex has reminded people of the dangers of living close to active volcanoes. While volcanic eruptions are relatively rare, they can cause significant damage to the environment and disrupt people's lives. The Argentine government has urged people living in the affected areas to remain vigilant and follow the guidelines provided by officials. In the meantime, officials are continuing their efforts to clear the ash and alleviate the situation for the affected residents. In conclusion, the ash cloud caused by the Puyehue-Cordón Caulle volcanic complex has caused significant disruptions to the daily lives of people in Argentina. Around 5,000 residents have been evacuated from their homes, and regional airports have been shut down. The situation has also caused concerns about the long-term damage to crops and other vegetation in the region. Officials are urging people to remain vigilant and follow the guidelines provided by authorities.
