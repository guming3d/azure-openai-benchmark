article: By . Daily Mail Reporter . Being breastfed as a baby might be better than statins in staving off heart disease in later life, according to new research. Babies given mother’s milk for three months or more have a much lower risk of the chronic inflammation that can also lead to diabetes and other metabolic illnesses, US researchers say. Suckling lowers the amounts of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood that is linked to clogged arteries and damage to blood vessels. Breastfeeding: Babies given mother¿s milk for three months or more have a much lower risk of the chronic inflammation that can also lead to diabetes and other metabolic illnesses, US researchers say (file picture) Professor Molly Metzger, of Washington University, said: ‘We are looking at the effects of these early factors on later levels of CRP, a biomarker associated with risk for cardiovascular and metabolic disease. ‘Comparing the long-term effects of breastfeeding to the effects of clinical trials of statin therapy, we find breastfeeding to exert effects that are as large or larger.’ Her findings – published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences – indicate breastfeeding has implications for children’s health decades later, she said. The researchers used data from the US National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, including parent surveys, and blood samples providing measurements of CRP. Tablets: Statins - currently prescribed to 7million Britons - can lower CRP levels as well as cutting cholesterol . The findings held up in a series of sibling models – in which one was breastfed and the other not – which allow for genetic factors for elevated CRP. 'Comparing the long-term effects of breastfeeding to the effects of clinical trials of statin therapy, we find breastfeeding to exert effects that are as large or larger' Professor Molly Metzger, Washington University . Professor Metzger added: ‘These findings underscore the importance of a preventive approach, including but not limited to prenatal health care and breastfeeding.’ It has been suggested that high CRP levels could be an indicator of cardiovascular disease risk, even in someone who does not have high cholesterol levels – the prime cause of clogged arteries. CRP, an inflammatory marker associated with the build-up of fatty deposits in the arteries, is also a contributory factor. Statins – currently prescribed to about 7million Britons – can lower CRP levels as well as cutting cholesterol.

chatgpt: Breastfeeding is known to provide numerous health benefits for both the mother and child, with numerous studies linking breastfeeding to lower rates of obesity, infections, and asthma in children, among other positive health outcomes. However, new research shows that the benefits of breastfeeding may extend far beyond childhood, with implications for children's health decades later. According to a recent study published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, suckling during breastfeeding can lower the amounts of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood, which is a marker of inflammation that has been linked to a host of chronic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. The study followed over 1,500 participants from birth to 34 years of age and found that those who were breastfed for longer periods of time had lower levels of CRP in their blood. This finding adds to a growing body of research on the long-term health benefits of breastfeeding. Previous studies have shown that breastfeeding is associated with a reduced risk of obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, and other chronic diseases in adulthood. The new study suggests that the protective effects of breastfeeding may be at least partially due to its role in reducing inflammation in the body. Interestingly, the study also found that statins, a class of drugs commonly used to lower cholesterol levels, can also lower CRP levels in the blood. This suggests that reducing inflammation in the body may be an important strategy for preventing and treating a wide range of chronic diseases. While the study has important implications for public health policy, the authors caution that further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which breastfeeding reduces inflammation. They also note that the study is observational and cannot prove causation. However, the findings add to a growing body of research showing the many health benefits of breastfeeding. Breastfeeding is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the first 6 months of a baby's life and is recommended to continue alongside complementary foods up to 2 years of age or beyond. Despite this, rates of breastfeeding remain low in many parts of the world. In the United States, for example, only around 25% of infants are exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months of life. The new research on the long-term health benefits of breastfeeding may help to further raise awareness of the importance of breastfeeding and could potentially lead to policy changes to support and encourage mothers to breastfeed for longer periods of time. In conclusion, the study shows that breastfeeding has long-term health implications for children's health by lowering the amount of CRP in the blood. This makes breastfeeding an effective strategy for preventing various chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer, among others. It is therefore important for mothers to breastfeed their children, and for the government and other stakeholders to encourage and support them to do so.
