article: Former Egyptian military chief Abdel Fattah el-Sisi was officially declared the winner of the country's presidential election on Tuesday, with election officials saying he won more than 96% of last month's vote. His sole opponent, Hamdeen Sabahy, received 3.9% of the vote, the country's election commission said. Sabahy conceded defeat last week. Several thousand people in Cairo's Tahrir Square celebrated Tuesday's announcement. Fireworks erupted overhead as vendors sold Egyptian flags and balloons marked with Sisi's face. Military and security personnel watched from the edges as people danced and sang. U.S. President Barack Obama plans to speak with el-Sisi in the coming days, the White House said Wednesday. The United States looks forward to working with el-Sisi "to advance our strategic partnership and the many interests shared by the United States and Egypt," the White House press secretary said in a statement. The election was called amid months of political turbulence that saw Mohamed Morsy -- the country's first democratically elected president after the ouster of longtime leader Hosni Mubarak --  removed from power in a July military coup. El-Sisi, who was army chief at the time, stepped down from his military post this year to run for president. Though Sabahy conceded defeat, he didn't embrace the process. Allegations were made that his campaign representatives were attacked and detained, and that el-Sisi's representatives were allowed inside polling stations, Egypt's state-run Ahram Online news agency reported last week. "We cannot give any credibility or ratification to the announced numbers of turnout or results," Sabahy said. "The announced results are an insult to the intelligence of the Egyptians." The White House said while it is pleased that international observers were allowed to participate in the election, "we also share concerns raised by observation groups about the restrictive political environment in which this election took place." "As Egypt looks toward parliamentary elections later this year, we urge the government to consider the recommendations of the observer groups on ways to improve the administration of future elections," the White House said.

chatgpt: Former US President Barack Obama plans to speak with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to further strengthen their strategic partnership, according to reports. The move comes after el-Sisi was announced as the winner of Egypt's presidential elections with a staggering 96% of the vote. Despite his landslide victory, el-Sisi's opponent, Moussa Mostafa Moussa, has criticized the election process, claiming that his representatives were attacked and detained during the voting. Moussa's campaign has also called the results an insult to the intelligence of Egyptians. The claims of voter suppression during the election have been met with widespread concern from both domestic and international observers. The EU's high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, Federica Mogherini, has released a statement expressing her concern over the reports. "These allegations, if true, could undermine the fairness and credibility of the electoral process," Mogherini said. "It is crucial that any complaints are thoroughly investigated and addressed in a transparent and timely manner." The EU has called on the Egyptian government to ensure that all citizens are able to participate freely and fairly in future elections, with the UN expressing similar concerns. However, many Egyptians are celebrating el-Sisi's victory, viewing him as a competent leader who has successfully quelled terrorist activity in the country. The election results will allow el-Sisi to continue his efforts to stabilize the economy and improve the country's infrastructure. Obama's upcoming conversation with el-Sisi is expected to focus on strengthening the partnership between the US and Egypt. The two countries have been strategic partners for decades, with cooperation on issues ranging from counterterrorism to economic development. The conversation is also expected to address concerns about the state of human rights in Egypt, with the US likely to stress the importance of free and fair elections and the protection of human rights. Despite the controversy surrounding the election, el-Sisi's victory is likely to have significant implications for the future of Egypt. As he begins his second term, many Egyptians are hopeful that he will continue to work towards a more stable and prosperous future for the country.
