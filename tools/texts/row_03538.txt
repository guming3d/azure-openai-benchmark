article: A Saudi blogger will be publicly flogged tomorrow as part of his 10-year jail term for 'ridiculing Islamic religious figures'. Raif Badawi, who co-founded the Free Saudi Liberals website, was arrested in 2012 and sentenced to 1,000 lashes and a decade in prison for insulting Islam on his online forum. His corporal punishment will be carried out after Friday prayers, outside the Al-Juffali mosque in Jiddah, which has earned the grisly nickname 'Chop Chop Square' as the site of executions. Raif Badawi, who co-founded the Free Saudi Liberals website, was arrested in 2012 and sentenced to 1,000 lashes and a decade in prison for insulting Islam on his online forum . The online activist was found guilty of cyber-crime in May last year and ordered by the Jiddah Criminal Court to pay a fine of 1 million Saudi riyals, or about £175,900. He was also charged with apostasy, which carries the death penalty in the Saudi Kingdom, but he was cleared of this crime in 2013. Badawi called his family from prison and informed them of the flogging, according to the Associated Press. Amnesty International said Badawi would receive 50 lashes on Friday and the rest of the sentence would be carried out over a period of 50 weeks. A whip, a leather strap or a long cane may be used to carry out floggings in Saudi Arabia (pictured) 'It is horrifying to think that such a vicious and cruel punishment should be imposed on someone who is guilty of nothing more than daring to create a public forum for discussion and peacefully exercising the right to freedom of expression,' said Philip Luther, Amnesty's Middle East and North Africa director. He will be publicly flogged tomorrow as part of his 10-year jail term for 'ridiculing Islamic religious figures' A whip, a leather strap or a long cane may be used to carry out floggings in Saudi Arabia, according to corpun.com, a website dedicated to the study of corporal punishment. 'Sometimes the lashes are confined to the buttocks, more often it seems they are spread out from the neck to the ankles, and usually with the prisoner simply lying face down on the ground. 'In one or two reports the offender was said to be tied upright to a post,' said corpun.com. Badawi was originally sentenced in 2013 to seven years in prison and 600 lashes, but after an appeal, the judge stiffened the punishment. Following his arrest, his wife and children left the kingdom for Canada. Badawi's lawyer Waleed Abul-Khair was sentenced in July to 15 years imprisonment and barred from traveling for another 15 years after being found guilty by an anti-terrorism court of 'undermining the regime and officials,' ''inciting public opinion' and 'insulting the judiciary.' Saudi Arabia's legal code follows Sharia Muslim law. Judges are trained as religious scholars and have broad scope to base verdicts and sentences on their own interpretation of religious texts.

chatgpt: Online activist Raif Badawi is set to be publicly flogged at the Jiddah mosque after he was handed a sentence of 1,000 lashes and ten years in prison last year for his online activism. The Saudi Arabian blogger has been convicted of cybercrime and for ridiculing Islamic figures, which prompted the authorities to shut down his online forum, Free Saudi Liberals. The flogging of Raif Badawi has drawn international attention and condemnation from rights groups. Numerous campaigns have been launched to free Badawi from prison where he is being held in harsh conditions, and the decision to flog him has brought a new wave of concern and frustration. The flogging was initially scheduled to happen last week, but it has since been postponed for unknown reasons. This decision has been welcomed by international human rights groups who have been arguing for the complete release of Badawi from prison. Raif Badawi started the Free Saudi Liberals website in 2008, which was an online platform for open discussion on religious and political issues. This move landed him in trouble with the authorities who were quick to shut down the site and arrest him. 
 
While Badawi's flogging is a controversial move, it is not the first time that Saudi Arabia has faced criticism for its treatment of activists and for its extreme punishment of crimes. Raif Badawi's case has raised questions about the country's commitment to freedom of speech and highlighted the need for more reforms. Human rights groups have urged the Saudi government to release Badawi and end its crackdown on free speech. This follows the release of some other activists by the Saudi government, including some women that were earlier jailed. In recent years, the Saudi government has made progress in some areas, including the introduction of some reforms, however, there are still concerns over the government's approach towards online activists, political dissidents, and women's rights. The controversy surrounding Raif Badawi's case has also divided the international community, with some countries criticizing Saudi Arabia's human rights record, while others have remained silent. The United Nations has expressed concern over the case, and multiple countries have called for the release of the imprisoned activist. The fate of Raif Badawi remains uncertain, along with other victims of the government's moves against free speech. As more people and organizations come out to support his cause, it is hoped that progress will continue to be made towards greater respect for human rights and civil liberties in Saudi Arabia.
