article: A Utah man whose dog was killed by police officers this summer plans to sue Salt Lake City for at least $1.5 million. Sean Kendall's 2-year-old Weimaraner, Geist, was shot on June 18 while cops were looking for a 3-year-old non-verbal boy who had been reported missing. While looking for the boy, Officer Brett Olsen entered Kendall's backyard and — feeling 'threatened' by the dog — shot him dead. The boy was found less than an hour later, sleeping in his own basement.

Geist confronted cops when they entered his human's backyard in June. Officer Brett Olsen said he felt 'threatened' by Geist and shot him dead. The missing child was found sleeping in his own home minutes later . Kendall, 27, on Wednesday filed the initial paperwork necessary to sue Salt Lake City. 'Geist was robbed of the vast majority of his life, and Kendall was robbed of Geist’s continued life with him, which cannot be replaced any more than a child or other family member can be replaced,' Kendall wrote in his notice of claim, filed by attorney Ross Anderson, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. 'Also, Kendall has suffered, and continues to suffer, severe and intense emotional pain, anguish, grief and trauma.' Hundreds of people have rallied outside Salt Lake City police headquarters to protest Geist's shooting. Many took their pets to the demonstrations as they demanded for Officer Olsen to be fired. Kendall, 27, says Geist was robbed of his life and that he has suffered intense anguish after his dog was killed . Happier times: Kendall says his dog had been his best friend for years and has struggled with his death . Geist had been with his human from the time he was a puppy, a couple years before he was shot dead . An internal investigation found that Olsen, a 10-year veteran at the police department, violated no policies. City officials offered Kendall $10,000 as a settlement, but he turned it down. He said he wants for officers to be properly trained on how to handle animals. He also wants Salt Lake City PD to change its policies on using force against animals. 'I understand the concern for a missing child,' Kendall has said. 'But that doesn't negate my rights as a property owner — and it doesn't replace my dog.' Geist's death has inspired hundreds of people in Salt Lake City to demand better training for cops on how to handle domestic animals and when to use force against them .

chatgpt: Salt Lake City resident Sean Kendall has filed a lawsuit against the city after his beloved Weimaraner, Geist, was shot by a police officer during a search for a missing child. On July 9th, police were called to the area after reports of a missing 3-year-old child who was non-verbal. The search led officers to Kendall's backyard, where Geist was playing. According to Officer Brett Olsen, he felt threatened by the dog and fired his weapon, fatally injuring Geist. The missing child was eventually found less than an hour later, sleeping in his own home. But the tragic events that unfolded in Kendall's backyard that day have left him devastated and seeking justice. Kendall's lawsuit, which is seeking $1.5 million in damages, alleges that the city and its police department violated his Fourth Amendment rights by unlawfully entering his private property and using excessive force against his dog. Geist was more than just a pet to Kendall; he was a beloved member of the family, often accompanying the family on outings and even serving as a ring bearer at Kendall's wedding. The loss of Geist has caused immense emotional distress for Kendall and his wife.  The lawsuit also argues that Officer Olsen, who has since left the police department, was not properly trained to handle dog encounters and should have used non-lethal methods to handle the situation. The lawsuit states, "Officer Olsen lacked the proper training to understand how to approach a household with a dog, did not use proper protocol and escalated the situation resulting in the unnecessary killing of a family pet." This case is not the first of its kind, with numerous cases of police brutality against dogs making headlines in recent years. Many animal welfare advocates have called for better training of police officers on how to handle dogs in potentially volatile situations. The city of Salt Lake City has yet to comment on the pending lawsuit, but Kendall is determined to seek justice for the loss of his beloved Geist. "No one should have to go through this," he stated. "We just want some accountability and change, so this doesn't happen to another family." The tragic shooting of Geist has shone a spotlight on the need for better training and protocols for police officers in handling dog encounters, and for greater respect for the rights of pet owners and their animals.
