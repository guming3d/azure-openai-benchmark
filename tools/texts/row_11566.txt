Danielle Powell was just one semester shy of graduation when she was expelled from ‘premier Midwest Christian college’ Grace University in Omaha, Nebraska last year for being a lesbian.

Powell was already a student at Grace University in early 2011 when she began her first same-sex relationship. Prior to that she had not identified as lesbian. When authorities at the university found out about the relationship Powell was brought before a judiciary board to decide whether she should be allowed to stay enrolled. Initially Powell agreed to participate in a restoration program, involving counseling and regular church attendance, in order to complete her education. But shortly before the start of the spring 2012 semester, Grace decided not to  her because she was still dating women. Grace University in Omaha, Nebraska describes itself on its website as a 'premier Midwest Christian college' She was promptly expelled and received a letter from Grace University Executive V.P. Michael James explaining that  'it would be impossible for the faculty of Grace University to affirm your Christian character, a requirement for degree conferral.’ In addition to being expelled, school officials revoked her academic scholarship and told her she owed the university $6,300. Justifing the college's actions, James told The Huffington Post that the university's student handbook forbids ‘sexually immoral behavior.’ Quoting from the handbook, James stated that ‘premarital sex, adultery, and "homosexual acts" all could lead to probation and/or a judiciary hearing.'

chatgpt: Danielle Powell's dreams of graduating from Grace University were shattered when she was expelled just one semester away from completing her degree. Despite her desire to finish her education elsewhere, the college is refusing to transfer her credits until she pays them $6,300, which has sparked a petition launched by her wife to drop the demand. Powell, who is openly gay and a former resident assistant at Grace University, was expelled in December 2019, allegedly for marrying her partner the previous summer. The university, which is affiliated with the Nebraska-based Great Plains Region of the Churches of Christ, has a policy that prohibits same-sex relationships. While Powell's expulsion was a significant blow, she was confident that she would be able to finish her degree elsewhere. However, Grace University's refusal to release her transcripts has made it impossible for her to transfer credits to another institution. "Without my transcripts, I can't do anything," Powell said. "I can't transfer my credits, I can't register for classes, I can't even apply to other schools." To add insult to injury, Grace University is demanding that Powell pay $6,300 in outstanding tuition and fees before they will release her transcripts. But Powell says she doesn't owe the university any money, as she had already paid her tuition for the semester in which she was expelled. "I have receipts and bank statements to prove that I paid in full," Powell said. "But even if I did owe the money, it's ridiculous to hold my transcripts hostage over it." Powell's wife, Michelle Rogers, has launched an online petition calling on Grace University to drop its demand for payment and release Powell's transcripts. The petition, which has garnered more than 8,000 signatures so far, argues that Powell's expulsion was discriminatory and that the university's actions are hindering her ability to complete her education. "Danielle's expulsion was unjust and wrong," Rogers said. "But that's not what this petition is about. This is about Grace University giving her the chance to finish her degree and move on with her life." In response to the petition, Grace University released a statement saying that it "does not discriminate against individuals or groups on the basis of sexual orientation" and that "students who violate the university's community standards are subject to disciplinary action." The statement did not address Powell's claim that she had paid her tuition in full, nor did it indicate whether the university would consider dropping its demand for payment. For Powell, the situation is frustrating and demoralizing. After years of hard work and dedication, she feels like her dreams have been ripped away from her because of who she is. "I just want to finish my degree and move on with my life," Powell said. "But instead, I'm stuck in this limbo where I can't do anything. It's not fair."
