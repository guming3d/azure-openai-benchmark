article: (CNN) -- Former rugby superstar Jonah Lomu has revealed that he is poised to make a shock playing comeback at the age of 34 with French third-division club Marseille Vitrolles. Jonah Lomu pictured in action for New Zealand's All Blacks during the 1999 World Cup in France. The giant New Zealander, who became a global name after an electrifying series of performances on the wing for the All Blacks at the 1995 World Cup, retired in 2007 after a succession of injuries hampered his attempt to return following a kidney transplant. He played 63 internationals, the last of them in 2002, but was never able to regain his previous dominance even after regaining full health. "Marseille Vitrolles is on the point of finalizing the transfer of the greatest legend in world rugby," said statement on the club's Web site. Lomu, who is featuring in a new worldwide advertising campaign for sportswear manufacturer adidas called "Nothing Is Impossible", was also quoted as confirming his desire to return to the playing field. "I took a sabbatical year to be at my pregnant partner's side and to fully enjoy this important moment in any man's life," he said on the Web site. "Everyone thought I had ended my playing career, but that was wrong. I still feel the desire to play and it will be me alone who decides when to call it a day. "My ambition is to help a club like Marseille join the group of top clubs in France." Lomu was first diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome, a rare and serious kidney disorder, at the end of 1996. He successfully returned to the game after treatment, but in May 2003 he was put on dialysis three times a week due to deterioration in his kidney function, with the treatment's side effects leaving him with severe nerve damage in his feet and legs. Lomu faced life in a wheelchair if a kidney transplant was not performed, so underwent the operation. He signed a two-year contract with New Zealand province North Harbour in 2005, and also played for Welsh club Cardiff Blues during the southern hemisphere's off-season. However, he was unable to achieve his goal of being selected in the All Blacks squad for the 2007 World Cup in France, having suffered a shoulder injury. Lomu agreed to play in a charity match in England last year, but withdrew after injuring his ankle in training.

chatgpt: Former All Blacks winger Jonah Lomu is returning to rugby after supposedly retiring in 2007. The 34-year-old will play for Marseille Vitrolles, a French third-division club.  Lomu is considered rugby's first global superstar after his breakout performance in the 1995 World Cup. He scored seven tries in the tournament and became a household name across the world. Lomu went on to score 37 tries in 63 appearances for the All Blacks before his career was derailed by health issues. In 1996, Lomu was diagnosed with a rare kidney disease and had to undergo dialysis three times a week. After receiving a kidney transplant from friend and New Zealand radio host Grant Kereama in 2004, Lomu returned to rugby in 2005 for the Cardiff Blues in Wales. He later joined the Marseille Vitrolles in 2006 but retired due to ongoing health concerns.  However, Lomu is now ready to return to rugby once again. "I'm thrilled to be joining Marseille Vitrolles and can't wait to get back on the field," Lomu said in a statement. "It's been a tough road for me, but I'm feeling fit and ready to contribute to the team." Lomu's return to rugby is a welcome sight for fans of the sport. His combination of speed, power, and size made him an unstoppable force on the field, and his presence on the Marseille Vitrolles team is sure to bring excitement to their games. While Marseille Vitrolles is only a third-division club, Lomu's addition to the team could help boost their profile and attract new fans to the sport. The club is located in the south of France and has a rich history, having been founded in 1932. Lomu's return to rugby is a testament to his love for the sport and his determination to keep playing despite his health setbacks. His fans are eager to see him back in action, and it will be exciting to see what he can bring to Marseille Vitrolles this season.
