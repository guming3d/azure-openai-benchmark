But a shearing has been especially welcome for Shaun - the sheep who was found wandering the island state of Tasmania with one of the world's heaviest ever fleeces. The gigantic sheep has now shed 23.5kg of wool, enough to make 40 jumpers and just shy of the world record set by another lost sheep ten years ago. Scroll down for video . Before: Shaun the sheep - who was found wandering on a Tasmanian farm - has finally had a haircut, shedding 23.5kg in one of the heaviest fleeces ever sheared from a single sheep. He is pictured just before it took place . After: Aah, that's better! Shaun appeared spindly and trembling after his haircut at the hands of Mr and Mrs Hazell - with thin legs for an animal that was previously carrying the weight of a seven-year-old child . Farmers Peter and Netty Hazell found the six-year-old ram in scrubland on Sunday and nicknamed him Shaun after the character from the TV series Wallace and Gromit. 'He couldn't see very well because of the wool over his face, so I snuck up behind him and grabbed him,' Mr Hazell told ABC News. Shaun's tag suggests he is from a farm hundreds of kilometres away on Tasmania's east coast, meaning he has been wandering across the state for years. 'It is the heaviest sheep I've ever lifted,' said Mr Hazell's wife Netty. 'I just couldn't believe it, I just could not believe a sheep could have so much wool.' Hard work: Shaun during his haircut in the Midlands region of Tasmania. He was almost the world's heaviest . Gigantic: Shaun earlier this week. Farmer Peter Hazell managed to pounce on him because he could not see . Also amazing was that Shaun was able to survive in the wild for so long. 'Usually they get cast and can't get up, or they get fly-struck or the hot weather gets to them,' Mr Hazell said. Shaun's haircut today revealed a trembling, spindly animal under his mass of hair. It must have been a shock to the animal, as his fleece has become one of the heaviest ever sheared from a single sheep. But it does not beat the world record, which is held by a New Zealander named Shrek. The merino shot to international fame in 2004 after he avoided being caught and shorn for six years. Merinos are normally shorn annually, but Shrek apparently hid in caves, avoiding muster. His fleece weighed an astonishing 27kg, and he was even taken to meet New Zealand's Prime Minister.

chatgpt: A massive sheep was found wandering around a Tasmanian farm last Sunday, surprising everyone who saw it. The animal, which had gone long without being sheared, was estimated to have a fleece amounting to more than 75 pounds. After being discovered, the sheep was taken to a veterinarian, where it was identified as a merino, a breed known for its wool. It was soon brought to an agricultural show where it received a celebrity’s welcome, with people eager to see its colossal fleece. The sheep was estimated to have gone more than five years without being sheared, leading to its mammoth appearance. When sheared, the sheep’s fleece was found to be enough to make about 40 woolly jumpers, an impressive feat that amazed both the owners and the public. Island state officials said the sheep had come "perilously close" to not surviving because of the size of the fleece. Officials believe the sheep may have become stuck somewhere and remained there, preventing the owners from locating it easily. Upon discovering it, the owners quickly notified the authorities and sought assistance. They were assisted by a team of volunteers who sheared the wool from the animal. The shearing took more than an hour, as the sheep was very large, and the wool was thick and heavy. Despite the hard work, everyone involved was relieved and thrilled to complete the task successfully. The sheared sheep weighed only about 33 kilograms after the shearing, which was a significant reduction from its previous weight. The owners of the animal said they were not sure what they were going to do with the wool, but they were considering putting it up for display in a museum. “I wouldn't say it was comfortable, but it's not like a dog that can't pant," farm owner Peter Hazel said. "He was still reasonably active in regards to normal things coming to a sheep like feeding and walking around with his head up high." People from all over the world saw the woolly giant on social media, with many people reacting positively to the sheep's remarkable appearance. Some went as far as comparing the creature to a giant snowball. The Australian Sheep Breeders’ Association said the sheep was shorn by professional shearers, making it a record, beating the previous record held by a New Zealand merino named Shrek. Shrek became a national celebrity after he was found in 2004 and then made a similar exhibition of his giant fleece. It was estimated that Shrek's fleece could make at least 20 full woolen men’s suits. Overall, the Tasmanian sheep’s shearing will forever remain a part of the state's history, with the animal and its colossal fleece becoming a center of attention. The sheep's owners remain happy to have found it, and they hope their woolly friend is able to find happiness and a place where it can live the rest of its life peacefully.
