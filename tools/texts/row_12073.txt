The concept of logos on buns isn't new, Umami Burger brands their burger buns . The college football stamps will add upwards of a dime to the price of each burger because Sonic has to pay both licensing and royalty fees to the universities. The burgers will retail between $3.99 - $4.99 at Sonics local to the teams featured. Consumers who don't like food coloring can request the burgers without the logos - but will still have to pay the same price. The concept was tested just in Louisiana last year and proved a hit with customers. If this expanded rollout program catches on, then O'Reilly expects that the company will consider expanding to include pro sports logos too. College football fans will soon be able to chow down on Sonic burgers emblazoned with their team's logo on it .

chatgpt: Sonic, the popular drive-in chain, is testing out a unique marketing strategy to attract more customers to its restaurants. The brand has partnered with universities in Oklahoma, Texas, and Louisiana to introduce its logo on the buns of their burgers and sandwiches. The company is optimistic that this regional approach will help it stand out in a highly competitive marketplace. The iconic Sonic logo, with its bright blue and red colors, will now be imprinted on the top buns of several of the chain's signature sandwiches. These include the Sonic Cheeseburger, SuperSonic Double Cheeseburger, Classic Crispy Chicken Sandwich, and others. Although this may seem like a minor change, it is expected to add approximately ten cents to the price of each meal, even if the bun is not logoed. According to Sonic's spokesperson, the company believes that this partnership with universities will help it gain more brand recognition and loyalty among younger demographics. "Our research shows that our customers, particularly those in college towns, are highly invested in their local teams and schools," the spokesperson said. "By aligning ourselves with these institutions, we hope to create a sense of community and pride around our brand." This strategy is not entirely new to the fast-food industry. Several major restaurant chains, including McDonald's and Dunkin', have partnered with professional sports teams and events to get their brand names in front of more consumers. However, Sonic's approach is unique in that it is targeting specific regions and demographics. The drive-in chain has been facing increased competition in recent years, with the rise of fast-casual restaurants and online food delivery services. Sonic's same-store sales have been declining for the past few quarters, and the company has been looking for new ways to attract customers. In addition to its university partnerships, the chain has also been experimenting with digital ordering systems and mobile app promotions. So far, the response to Sonic's logoed buns has been mixed. Some customers have expressed enthusiasm for the new look, likening it to the "local pride" displayed on license plates and sports jerseys. However, others have criticized the added cost and the potential for the logo to affect the taste and texture of the bun. Despite the mixed reactions, Sonic plans to continue its university partnerships and regional marketing efforts. The company says that it is committed to staying ahead of the curve in the fast-food industry and finding new ways to innovate and connect with its customers. Only time will tell if this strategy pays off in the long run, but for now, Sonic fans can enjoy a new twist on their classic favorites.
