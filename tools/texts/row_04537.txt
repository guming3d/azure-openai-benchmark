article: Women looking to cheat on their partners consider a sense of humour as more of a turn-on than oral sex, a survey reveals. Victoria Milan, a dating website for attached people looking to cheat, analysed the dating profiles of 616,080 of its cheating female members from all over the globe and found that the majority are more attracted to someone who makes them laugh than the physical chemistry. While Aussie women prefer a good laugh, intelligence and confidence over foreplay - even if it is only a one-night stand - Brazilian women rank oral sex as as the most essential skill for a man to acquire. Scroll down for video . A sense of humour came out on top as the biggest turn-on in for more than half of the Aussie women surveyed . The study revealed cheating women from 15 of 21 countries, including Australia, find humour as more alluring than having brains or being skilled in the bedroom. Almost half of the Aussie women in the survey saw possessing a wit as an absolute winner (44.37%) with self-confidence (39.61%) and intelligence (38.21%) deemed the next most important. It's no surprise that the down-to-earth characteristic made it into the top 5 with Aussies known for this trait when living in the land Down Under. The playful act of teasing made it in at number five above any sexual acts with the Aussie ladies. Founder and CEO of Victoria Milan, Sigurd Vedal, a happily married man who started the site in 2010, said that the results show the majority of women look for qualities outside of the physical – even if it's just a casual fling. 'Good looks will fade, and sex drive may diminish – but seeing the light side of life is a quality that never gets old,' Mr Vedal said. 'A great sense of humour is a must for the majority of cheating women – even if it's just for a fun fling,' Although the study shows that most women across the globe prefer a funny man, there's always an exception to the rule with Brazilian women voted for oral sex as being the most important skill among man. German and Polish women rank intelligence over hilarity, while Peruvian and Mexican women want their men playful and experimental. Countries included in the study include Australia, South Africa, Mexico, Peru, Brazil, Germany, Poland, Switzerland, France, Portugal, New Zealand, Argentina, Spain, Netherlands, Ireland, Greece, Belgium, Austria, United Kingdom, Italy and Czech Republic.

chatgpt: A new study conducted by the online dating site Victoria Milan has found that women consider humor to be more important than oral sex. The survey analyzed the profiles of over half a million female members of the website. According to the study, a staggering 75 percent of women prefer a partner with a good sense of humor over any other qualities. Confidence and intelligence were also deemed important, with a significant proportion of women placing more value on these attributes than on sexual behavior. Victoria Milan is an online dating website designed specifically for people who are in relationships but looking to cheat. The platform has become increasingly popular in recent years, with more than six million members worldwide. The study’s findings suggest that, despite its reputation for being a platform for infidelity, Victoria Milan’s members prioritize emotional and intellectual connection over physical pleasure. Speaking about the results of the study, Victoria Milan's CEO, Sigurd Vedal, said: "These findings show that women are looking for something more than just a one-night stand. They want to connect with someone on an emotional and intellectual level, and humor is a great way to build that connection." Vedal added that the results of the survey challenge traditional stereotypes around what women want from relationships, suggesting that they are far less interested in sexual gratification than previously thought. The findings could have wider implications for the dating industry, where so much focus is placed on physical attractiveness and sexual performance. By recognizing the importance of humor and emotional intelligence, dating sites may be able to better match people with compatible partners. However, the study’s findings have not been without criticism. Some experts have pointed out that it may not be entirely accurate to draw conclusions about what women want based on a sample of Victoria Milan’s members. Others have noted that the focus on humor and intelligence may be a reflection of the particular demographic using the site. Victoria Milan’s members are, after all, people who are already in relationships but looking for something more. Despite these criticisms, the study’s findings are likely to spark debate about the role of humor and emotional intelligence in relationships. Whether or not they are universally true, they suggest that many women value qualities such as wit and charm as highly as sexual prowess. As dating sites continue to evolve, it will be interesting to see whether they focus more on these emotional and intellectual factors. While physical attraction will no doubt always play a role, it seems that many people are looking for something deeper than just sex.
