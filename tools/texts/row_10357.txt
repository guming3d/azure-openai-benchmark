That is the question that officials in New Jersey were trying to answer after a dead 15-foot-whale that washed up in Atlantic City was found Thursday morning spray-painted purple. Police say the markings are not gang-related and appear to be Greek letters. The symbols were Tau Epsilon Phi - the name of a fraternity that has chapters at several area schools - followed by what looked like '94.'

chatgpt: A 15-foot-long minke whale has washed up under Central Pier, leaving experts and onlookers stunned. The whale, which is believed to weigh up to two tons, was reportedly tagged with Greek letters Tau Epsilon Phi, sparking concern among marine biologists and conservationists. Tau Epsilon Phi is a national fraternity with chapters at three local universities, according to sources. This has caused confusion among officials, who are unsure how the whale came to be tagged with the letters and what the significance of the letters may be. Despite the mystery surrounding the tagging of the whale, experts are now working to determine the cause of its death. Marine biologists on the scene have already begun to examine the whale, taking measurements and conducting tests to see if any underlying health conditions may have contributed to its death. The whale's discovery has also sparked concern among environmentalists, who fear that it may be a sign of the damage being done to our oceans. "It's heartbreaking to see a beautiful creature like this wash up on our shores," said one activist. "We need to do everything we can to protect our marine life and ensure that they can thrive for generations to come." The local community has also been transfixed by the discovery of the whale. Hundreds of people have turned out to see the creature, taking photos and sharing their thoughts on social media. Many are expressing their sadness at the loss of such a magnificent animal, while others are sharing their hopes that it will serve as a wake-up call to those who may not understand the impact of their actions on the environment. While the tagging of the whale with the letters Tau Epsilon Phi remains a mystery, experts are urging people not to jump to conclusions. "We need to wait for the results of the tests before we can say anything for certain," said a marine biologist. "There could be any number of reasons why this whale ended up on our shores, and until we have all the information, we can't make any assumptions." For now, the whale's body will remain under Central Pier as experts work to determine its cause of death. It will then be carefully removed, with plans already underway to ensure that it is disposed of in an environmentally responsible manner. This discovery of this minke whale has served as a sobering reminder of the impact that humans are having on our oceans, and the need for us to take immediate action to protect our marine life. It is our responsibility to ensure that these magnificent creatures, and the environments they live in, are protected for future generations.
