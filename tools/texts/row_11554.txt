article: (CNN) -- A Dutch Court will decide the fate Friday of 13-year-old Laura Dekker, either making her a potential world-record-breaking sailor, or returning her to school. Laura Dekker will find out on Friday whether the Dutch Court will back her record attempt. Welfare services in the Netherlands have taken legal action to try to stop the teen from attempting to become the youngest person to sail solo around the world because they believe the voyage will be too dangerous. The Dutch Council for Child Protection has applied to the District Court in the city of Utrecht for Dekker to be made a ward of court so that her parents, who support her plans, temporarily lose the right to make decisions about her. Laura's father, Dick Dekker, has already had a request for her to miss two years of school turned down. However, CNN affiliate TVNZ reported that Laura, who was born off the coast of New Zealand and began sailing solo when she was 10, may attempt to obtain a Kiwi passport which would allow her to start her round the world trip from New Zealand shores instead. Laura's court battle comes as a 17-year-old English teen sailed into the record books Thursday as the youngest person to circumnavigate the globe to date. Mike Perham sailed into Lizard Point in Cornwall, the southernmost point in Britain, at 9:47 a.m. (4:47 a.m. ET) to mark the end of his 48,280-kilometer (30,000-mile), 282-day ocean journey. Perham set off on his round-the-world trip on November 18. He has been sailing his yacht, TotallyMoney.com, single-handedly, though a support team has been sailing next to him along the way. Perham told CNN how he battled 50-foot waves and 57 mph winds in the Southern Ocean between Australia and Antarctica. He said at one point, a "freak wave" picked up the boat and turned it on its side.

chatgpt: Laura Dekker, a 13-year-old Dutch girl, has a bold ambition: to become the youngest person ever to sail solo around the world. However, her plans have hit a snag as Dutch social workers have prevented her from pursuing her endeavor citing itâ€™s too dangerous. Dekker has now come up with a plan to overcome this obstacle by applying for a New Zealand passport instead of Dutch to start her bid from there. Speaking to reporters, she said, "I'm going to sail around the world before I'm 16 years old, and I'm going to do it alone." She sees nothing wrong with her ambition and believes in her capabilities. This news comes at a time when a 17-year-old English boy recently broke the current record for being the youngest person to sail around the world solo. However, Dekker is unfazed by histories and is on a quest to achieve something remarkable. The case of Laura Dekker has divided opinions in the Netherlands, with some supporting her dream while others believe it's too risky. The court has sided with the latter, stating that her desire was laudable but that her ambition would put her in danger. Consequently, social workers have not allowed her to sail alone and might continue to do so, even with a New Zealand passport. Dekker, who was born on a boat and has been sailing since she was six years old, believes that her experience makes her well-equipped to undertake the venture safely. She wants to prove that age is just a number and she has the courage, skill, and determination to see it through.  Time will tell whether Laura Dekker will succeed in her quest. However, her spirit and resilience prove that nothing is impossible if one sets their mind to it. The challenges she faces as a 13-year-old budding sailor have sparked a conversation worldwide concerning how young sailors can pursue their dreams safely.
