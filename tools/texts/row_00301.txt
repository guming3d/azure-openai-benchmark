article: Peekaboo: Researchers found that young children believe they are invisible if people can't see their eyes . It's an adorable game parents have played with their young children for generations. But now researchers are looking for a scientific answer to explain why children think they actually disappear when they cover their eyes while playing peekaboo. Researchers led by James Russell at the University of Cambridge have carried out the first study into this bizarre trait with groups of three and four-year-old children. The children's eyes were covered with masks and they were then asked whether they could be seen by the researchers - with most saying no. Many also believed that the researchers could not see adults who were wearing eye masks - leading to the conclusion most young children believe that anyone who covers their eyes is obscured from other people's view. The researchers then attempted to distinguish what exactly creates the feeling of invisibility - whether it was not being able to see at all or just because the other person couldn't see their eyes. The children were given a pair of mirrored goggles so that while they could see through the glasses, no one could see their eyes. Unfortunately, only 7 of the 37 participating children were able to get to grips with the idea that while they could still see, no one could see their eyes. But of those who did understand the concept, six believed they were invisible if the researchers couldn't see their eyes, even if they could still see them. Although when the children were asked to . explain how they were made invisible by simply hiding their eyes, many . knew that their bodies remained visible, suggesting a childhood . distinction between their physical bodies and the 'self' they connect to . their eyes. Hide and seek: The children in the survey also believed that other people become invisible if they cover their eyes even though their bodies are still visible . To test this theory that children believe they can be seen only through their eyes, the researchers looked directly at each of the children while asking them to avert their gaze. They then did the same process in reverse, with the children looking at the researchers while they diverted their eyes. In each instance, the majority of children felt they were not being seen so long as their eyes didn't meet the other person's, giving some support to the ideology of eyes being the the window to the soul.

chatgpt: Recent research from the University of Cambridge has uncovered a fascinating insight into the way children perceive the world. According to the study, children believe that if other people can't see their eyes, they become invisible to those around them. Additionally, toddlers also believe that if an adult's eyes are hidden, even if their body is visible, they cannot be seen by others. This research indicates a link between the 'sense of self' and the eyes. The idea that one's eyes are essential to their sense of self has long been recognized in literature and film. Think, for instance, about characters such as the Phantom of the Opera, whose deformity covers his eyes or Marvel's Daredevil - whose blindness heightens the sensitivity of his other senses. The idea is not new, but the research published by the University of Cambridge has now provided scientific evidence for it. The study's lead author, Dr. Vanessa LoBue, explains: "Children's understanding of self is still in the early stages of development, and one of the ways that they come to know themselves is through their perception of what their own bodies can do." She continues, "The findings of our research suggest that the sense of self is linked to the eyes, and that the eyes play an important role in how children perceive themselves in relation to others." To conduct the study, researchers presented a group of children with a puppet show in which one character was "invisible" to others. The results showed that children as young as four years old believed that if they couldn't see the puppet's eyes, they couldn't see them either. The study also found that the belief was strongest when the eyes were hidden by an object, such as a hat or a mask. Dr. LoBue and her team believe that this finding has practical implications for parents, caregivers, and educators. They suggest that adults can use this knowledge to help children develop a stronger sense of self-awareness. For example, parents can encourage young children to look into a mirror and identify body parts to promote self-recognition. The study is also valuable for its implications in the cognitive sciences. Previous research has shown that a child's sense of self is closely tied to their interaction with others, especially peers. The University of Cambridge's research indicates that the eyes play a critical role in that interactive process. Dr LoBue says: "We believe that this study can help us better understand how children develop social and cognitive skills, and how to support them at different stages of development." In conclusion, the University of Cambridge's recent research suggests that children believe they become invisible if other people can't see their eyes, which sheds light on a child's early sense of self. The study indicates the importance of the eyes in how children perceive themselves in relation to others, highlighting the critical role they play in social and cognitive skill development. With this knowledge, caregivers and parents alike can help children develop a stronger sense of self-awareness and promote their cognitive and social growth.
