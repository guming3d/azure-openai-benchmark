Everyone can walk at whatever speed they want.' Meadowhall Centre Director Darren Pearce believed it was a great idea and responded to the letter, before meeting with Chloe to discuss her suggestion. 'I want to thank Chloe for taking the time to write in and share her views with us – we love to hear feedback from our younger shoppers,' said Mr Pearce.

Chloe said: 'When my teacher, Mr Lawson, asked me to write a letter about something I’d like to change, I never thought it would actually happen.

'It’s great that they’re taking her idea further and putting it forward into the shopping centre. 'She loves to have a moan, I think she’s a bit of a grumpy old woman at heart'
