School truants are being hauled out of bed by police and escorted to classes in a patrol car. Officers are clamping down on truants by calling at the homes of any pupils who fail to turn up to school without a reason. If they are still in bed, police get the parents to wake them up before driving them to lessons. Clampdown: School truants are being hauled out of bed by police and escorted to classes in a patrol car (file picture) The crackdown is the first of its kind and was launched last week in Amesbury, Wiltshire. Inspector Christian Lange, the town’s police chief, said it is already producing results. He said: 'So far, one early morning visit from the police has been enough. 'It’s not good for the parents when their neighbours see us knocking on their doors and taking their kids off to school.' Each morning, police officers are provided with a list of children who have failed to turn up at school without a reasonable explanation. Insp Lange said: 'Of course, if they are off sick or there is a good reason then we don’t intervene. 'If they are still in bed, we get their parents to wake them up, we put them in the car and deliver them straight to school.' Officers are accompanied by an education welfare officer and are working closely in partnership with Wiltshire Council and local schools. Targeting truants: Inspector Christian Lange, the town's police chief, said the scheme is already producing results . It is hoped the crackdown will help reduce antisocial behaviour in the town and ensure that children are getting their education. Insp Lange said: 'The correct place for a child of that age to be is in school. 'If they are not in school they are more likely to get into trouble - it’s not good for anyone to be hanging around, doing nothing all day. 'Truancy is a recurring problem for a small number of children. They are missing out on their education, and if us waking them up and taking them to school is what is needed, then that is what we will do. 'So far we have been very pleased with the results, it is early days but we are taking truancy very seriously. 'It is a real example of a partnership working and getting things done.' Parents have a legal responsibility to ensure their children attend school until they are 16. From next year the school leaving age is due to rise to 17, and to 18 in 2015. Fixed penalty notices and fines can be issued if parents fail to make sure their children go to school along with parenting contracts and parenting orders designed to enforce attendance.

chatgpt: In a bid to reduce the number of truants within Amesbury, Wiltshire, officers have implemented a new scheme. This pioneering approach involves officers visiting the homes of pupils who have failed to attend school without a valid reason. This move comes after a spike in truancy rates which saw many children skipping school without any explanation. The scheme has been implemented with the hope of ensuring that all pupils within Amesbury attend school regularly and receive the education they deserve. The officers involved in the scheme will visit the homes of pupils who have not turned up to school without a valid explanation. They will question the children's parents or guardians as to why their child did not attend and ask them to provide a valid reason. If a valid reason is not provided, then the officers will take the necessary steps to ensure the child attends school. These steps may include issuing fines or taking legal action against the parents or guardians. Although this is the first scheme of its kind in Amesbury, similar initiatives have been implemented across the country. Many have touted these types of schemes as a successful way of ensuring children attend school regularly. A spokesperson for the local council said, "We are committed to ensuring that every child within Amesbury receives a good education. By implementing this scheme, we hope to reduce the number of truants and increase attendance rates across the town." Many parents and teachers have welcomed the initiative. They believe that regular attendance is essential for children to achieve their full potential and succeed academically. They are delighted with the officers' work and the efforts being made to improve attendance rates within Amesbury. However, some have raised concerns about the impact this scheme may have on the children involved. Some have said that it could create an atmosphere of fear and tension within the pupils' homes, which could harm their relationships with their parents or guardians. Others argue that it could be an invasion of privacy. Despite these concerns, it is clear that the initiative has been implemented with the best interests of the children in mind. The officers involved have been trained to handle the situation sensitively and with compassion, ensuring that the children's safety and wellbeing are not compromised. In conclusion, the implementation of this scheme in Amesbury, Wiltshire, is a bold and innovative move to reduce truancy rates and improve attendance rates within the town. Although concerns have been raised, it is clear that this initiative has been implemented with the best interests of the children in mind. We can only hope that the scheme proves successful and leads to an increase in attendance rates across Amesbury, ensuring that all children have the opportunity to achieve their full potential.
