When Radwanska had break points, two of them, both in the second set, she failed to convert. Makarova had eight and took five — decisive and devastating. Winner: Makarova celebrates her straight sets win on Monday evening .

Makarova, 26, is paired with Lucie Safarova, the 23rd seed from the Czech Republic, who made light work of qualifier Tereza Smitkova. She said: ‘I am very comfortable this year. My parents are over here with me and we are all staying in the same house. It is like I am at home, eating Russian food that my mum cooks. I feel very good.’ Day to remember: Makarova hit 24 winners and only made six unforced errors .

chatgpt: In a stunning upset, fourth seed Agnieszka Radwanska suffered a tough defeat at the hands of Ekaterina Makarova during their third-round match at Wimbledon. Makarova emerged victorious in straight sets, defeating Radwanska in less than an hour. The match got off to a quick start, with both players showing their strengths early. However, it was Makarova who was able to capitalize on the opportunities presented to her, breaking Radwanska's serve twice in the opening set. Unable to keep up with Makarova's aggressive play, Radwanska struggled to find her rhythm, eventually losing the first set 6-3. The second set was no different, as Makarova continued to dominate with her massive forehand and consistent ball striking. Radwanska had no answers to Makarova's array of shots and found herself trailing by a break once again. Despite her best efforts, the Polish player could not muster up enough resistance to fight back, and Makarova sealed the victory in straight sets, winning 6-3, 6-2. The defeat comes as a major shock, as Radwanska was touted as one of the favorites to win the tournament. However, Makarova's win should not come as a surprise, given her impressive form leading up to the match. Makarova had already dispatched a couple of tough opponents en route to the third round and looked confident and focused against Radwanska. As the fourth seed, Radwanska will be bitterly disappointed with her performance, and her exit will leave the tournament wide open for other contenders. Meanwhile, Makarova will look ahead to her next match, feeling confident and ready to keep progressing through the draw. Despite the disappointing result for Radwanska, she can be proud of her overall performance at this year's championships. She had a solid run and will look to use the experience gained to improve and come back stronger next year.
