Price hikes: Property rent in Oakland, California city shot up by a staggering 20.6per cent last year, reflecting a trend across the country . Lakewood in Colorado is another city where residents have felt the hike, with monthly rentals jumping 15per cent to an average of $1,770. Experts say that because fewer Americans can afford to buy a home, demand for apartments and rental houses has pushed up prices. The share of Americans who own their homes has slipped to 64.4 percent from a peak of 69.2 percent in 2004. This is attributed to the housing market crash that triggered the Great Recession in late 2007 . 'We do not have the affordable rental housing resources to meet the demand,' said Barry Zigas, director of housing policy at the Consumer Federation of America, at an industry conference this week. Rental prices have risen 52per cent since 2000, while incomes for renters have only increased 25 percent, said Stan Humphries, chief economist at Zillow. The higher costs make it difficult for renters to save for a down payment, which then causes them to rent for a longer period of time and delay any potential home purchases. 'You don’t have to be a housing economist to see that there is a problem there,' Humphries said.

Additional construction has yet to significantly limit price growth nationwide. Builders broke ground on 376,000 apartment complexes last year, a 10.2per cent increase from 2013, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday. By contrast, single-family house construction rose just 1.4per cent last year. Rents jumped 15.4per cent in the San Francisco area to a median monthly cost of $3,031, an increased mirrored by San Jose where prices were up 14.5per cent to $3,187 a month. Rents climbed 10.5per cent in Denver to $1,817 a month. Kansas City also notched a substantial 8.5per cent gain to $1,204 a month. Still, tenants are catching a break elsewhere. In Chicago, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, DC, rents rose by less than 2.2per cent. Rents in Minnesota’s Twin Cities area ticked up a mere 0.1per cent this past year to $1,501.

chatgpt: According to new data released by rental platform Zumper, the average monthly rental fee for a home in tech-centric Oakland has surged to $2,369, marking a 3.3 per cent increase over the previous year. Oakland has rapidly become a popular destination for tech professionals, thanks to its close proximity to Silicon Valley and San Francisco. As a result, rental prices have skyrocketed, causing concern among residents. The data shows that the average cost of renting a one-bedroom apartment in Oakland is now $2,120 per month, while a two-bedroom apartment will set tenants back an average of $2,589 per month. The surge in rental prices in Oakland is not an isolated incident, with analysts finding that U.S. rental prices rose by 3.3 per cent in December compared to the same time the previous year. Experts attribute this increase to the continued growth of tech hubs across the country. Lakewood in Colorado is another city where residents have felt the sting of rental price hikes. Monthly rental charges have jumped by a staggering 15 per cent to $1,770, making it increasingly challenging for many residents to keep up with the rising costs. Despite the steep increase in rental prices in some cities, experts predict that the rental market will continue to grow in popularity in 2020. This is due in part to changes in the U.S. housing market, as more renters forego the idea of home ownership in favor of the flexibility and convenience offered by a rental property. Zumper's data highlights the growing divide between rental costs in urban and suburban areas, as well as the impact of the tech industry on local economies. In many cities, residents are being driven out of expensive urban areas and into more affordable suburban locations. While the rental market continues to grow and evolve, many experts urge caution when signing a lease agreement. Prospective tenants are advised to thoroughly research the rental market in their area, negotiate rental terms whenever possible, and carefully review all lease agreements. Overall, the 3.3 per cent increase in rental prices seen in 2019 is indicative of the broader trends affecting the U.S. economy. As the tech industry continues to grow and evolve, rental markets in urban areas will likely remain competitive and expensive for the foreseeable future.
