article: By . Glen Owen . Norman Baker, pictured last year, is rebelling against civil servants' order that he must be chauffeur-driven between his office and the House of Commons . When politicians are embroiled in rows over Government chauffeurs, it is usually because they have abused the privilege. But not so colourful Home Office Minister Norman Baker, who is rebelling against an order to use a driver by demanding that officials provide him with a ‘ministerial bike’ instead. The Liberal Democrat, whose appointment to Theresa May’s team was the biggest shock of the autumn reshuffle, says civil servants have told him he must be chauffeured the quarter-mile between his desk at the Home Office and the Commons. When he told them that he would rather pedal and asked them to provide a bicycle, they refused – on the grounds that it would be an ‘unacceptable burden’ on the taxpayer. Last night, Mr Baker hit out at what he described as a ‘ridiculous, Yes Ministerish jobsworth’ attitude. ‘I object to the fact that they are trying to put me into a car with a chauffeur against my will,’ he said. ‘I pointed out that it would be much quicker and cheaper for me to cycle. But they said that while the car was already paid for, providing a bike would be an additional cost to the taxpayer. It’s nonsense. ‘It would be cheaper and also better for the environment.’ Mr Baker, 56, added: ‘I could provide my own bike, but I regard it is a matter of principle.’ It is understood that the row has gone all the way to Sue Gray, the  Cabinet Office’s Director General of Propriety and Ethics, who has backed the officials. And last night the Home Office, which spends £136,000 a year on chauffeuring its Ministers around, was sticking to its guns. One of Mr Baker’s own spokesmen said: ‘Ministerial travel is governed  by the Ministerial Code, which states that arrangements must be efficient and cost-effective. The Minister said he would rather cycle the quarter-mile distance between his desk at the Home Office and the House of Commons (pictured) ‘Providing bicycles would mean additional and unnecessary cost to the department when arrangements are already in place. For short journeys, and where practicable, Ministers can walk or use public transport.’ Mr Baker’s appointment was surprising because he once wrote a book claiming British spies covered up the death of Dr David Kelly, who exposed Tony Blair’s ‘dodgy dossier’ on Iraq. However, sources say relations between Mr Baker and Mrs May are ‘surprisingly cordial and pragmatic’.

chatgpt: The former Liberal Democrat MP and Minister, Norman Baker, has made headlines after requesting a bicycle instead of being chauffeur-driven to government meetings. Baker, who resigned from his position as Home Office Minister, has been critical of the government’s expenditure on transportation. He argued that cycling would not only be healthier and more environmentally friendly, but it would also save the taxpayer’s money. However, his request was denied on the grounds that a bike would be an “unacceptable burden” on the taxpayer. The Home Office spends a whopping £136,000 a year on chauffeuring ministers to meetings, conferences, and events. This cost includes the salaries of the drivers, fuel costs, and vehicle maintenance expenses. Baker called this expense “ridiculous” and accused civil servants of having a “Ministerish jobsworth” attitude. The former MP believes that ministers, just like everyday citizens, should consider alternative modes of transport such as cycling. He argued that cycling is a much cheaper and greener option, and it can also help with keeping fit and healthy. In an interview, Baker stated that he used to cycle everywhere, and he had even cycled to the House of Commons during his time as an MP. However, civil servants at the Home Office rejected Baker’s request for a bike. They stated that providing bikes for ministers would be too expensive, and the cost of maintaining them would be burdening the taxpayer in the long run. A spokesperson for the Home Office argued that ministers had to travel to various locations and attend important meetings, and providing them with cars was necessary for their safety and convenience. Despite this, Baker’s stance on alternative transportation continues to gain attention. Cycling advocacy groups have shown their support for Baker’s stance, highlighting the benefits of cycling for both individuals and the environment. They argue that ministers should lead by example and promote cycling as a viable mode of transport in the UK. Baker’s request for a bike has not only sparked a conversation about government expenditure on transportation, but it has also highlighted issues around the prioritization of cars in the UK. The number of cars on UK roads continues to contribute to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Cycling advocacy groups assert that prioritizing cycling over cars would result in a healthier, more sustainable future for the UK. In conclusion, Norman Baker’s request for a bike may have been denied, but it has gained attention for highlighting the potential benefits of cycling as a mode of transport for UK ministers. Despite the opposition from civil servants, cycling advocacy groups continue to push for an increased focus on alternative transportation options that are both environmentally friendly and cost-effective. As the UK looks to a greener future, it remains to be seen whether cycling will become a more accepted and widespread mode of government transportation.
