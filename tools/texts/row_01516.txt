article: Washington (CNN)A key staffer for former Rep. Michele Bachmann's ill-fated 2012 presidential campaign in Iowa has signed on to retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson's developing shadow campaign. Ryan Rhodes, who served as Bachmann's tea party outreach director in the state, told CNN in an interview he's joining the American Legacy Center, a conservative policy group that would likely form the basis for a Carson campaign if he decides to run. "Iowa's obviously very important as it goes on the national stage and as it relates to the presidential. That's where the action is," Rhodes said. Rhodes said in his new role for the group he would be connecting Carson with activists when the retired neurosurgeon visits the key early-caucus state, and spreading Carson's message to potential supporters there. "As [Carson's] preparing to make his decision, we're going to be out here advocating for the issues that are important to him," he said. "Everybody is looking for the candidates to come through. A lot of people don't really make their decision until after they've gotten to talk to the candidates." Rhodes told Real Clear Politics, which first reported the news of his hiring, that he was contacted by multiple potential presidential contenders and chose to go with Carson because "he is the embodiment of the American dream and there's no better person to advocate restoring the American dream than Ben." The tea party activist endorsed Bachmann shortly before her unexpected win of the Ames Straw Poll in 2011, and later joined her campaign. Bachmann, however, ultimately came in sixth in the 2012 Iowa caucuses, a finish that doomed her candidacy early on. But Rhodes remains a prominent figure in conservative circles in the state, and his hiring by a group linked to Carson suggests the rising conservative star is getting serious about a potential run. Carson makes case for White House bid . A strong finish in this year's Ames Straw Poll could put Carson on the map in the race, much as it did for Bachmann. And his growing following has forced establishment Republicans to get serious about him. Carson polled third in a CNN/ORC survey of the potential presidential field conducted late last month, and was invited to speak at the Republican National Committee's winter meeting this week. While there, however, he displayed the very penchant for off-the-cuff controversial remarks that has establishment Republicans still wary of him, suggesting ISIS offers an example of an admirable commitment to principles that the U.S. lacks.

chatgpt: Former Michele Bachmann staffer, Ryan Rhodes, has joined a pro-Ben Carson group in Iowa as the 2016 GOP primary heats up. Rhodes, who previously served as Bachmann's tea party outreach director, informed CNN that his primary goal will be introducing Carson to potential supporters in the state, which is expected to play a crucial role in the Republican nomination. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, has gained a substantial amount of traction in the past few months, emerging as one of the leading Republican candidates. However, given the crowded field of contenders and the unpredictability of primaries, Carson would need a strong finish in Iowa to maintain his momentum in the race. Meanwhile, Rhodes' decision to join Carson's team could potentially cause a rift between him and his previous employer. Bachmann, who has also made appearances in Iowa and enjoyed support from the tea party movement, has been a vocal critic of Carson in the past. In response to Carson's remarks about the possibility of a Muslim president, Bachmann stated that "the American people are looking for solutions, not the kind of rhetoric that's going to divide us." Despite the possibility of a clash, Rhodes insists that his decision to back Carson stems from his belief that the retired surgeon is the "most authentic candidate in the race" who can unite the country. Rhodes' addition to Carson's team comes at a time when the latter is grappling with declining poll numbers. While Carson has received high marks for his personal story, his lack of foreign policy experience and tendency to make controversial statements have raised some concerns among voters. Carson has acknowledged these weaknesses and vowed to improve on them. He has also intensified his campaign efforts in Iowa, holding several town hall meetings and events in the state. According to recent polls, Carson and Republican frontrunner Donald Trump are neck and neck in Iowa, with Trump leading by a slim margin. Given the importance of Iowa in the nomination process, both candidates are expected to ramp up their efforts to secure the state's support. For his part, Rhodes noted that he is committed to helping Carson spread his message and garner support. In a statement, Rhodes said that "Ben Carson's message resonates with Iowans who are looking for a candidate with a positive vision for America's future. I'm excited to join his team and help him share that vision with the people of Iowa." As the primary date draws closer, the battle for Iowa is set to become increasingly intense, with Carson, Trump, and other candidates vying for a chance to emerge as the GOP nominee. With the addition of Ryan Rhodes to the mix, the stakes have just gotten higher.
