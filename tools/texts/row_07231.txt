article: Bruce Batten was surprised to see an unseasonable visitor on the second-floor deck of his Eagle River home. The former U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service employee from Anchorage heard his dogs barking at about 1:30am Friday. He looked out of the French doors off his bedroom, flipped on a light and saw what was upsetting the dogs: a black bear feeding on a bird feeder. The audience didn't bother the bear. Unwelcome guest: In this November 7, 2014 photo provided by Bruce Batten, a black bear eats seeds inside a bird feeder on a second-floor porch after walking up a flight of stairs in Eagle River, Alaska . 'He's like, "Excuse me, I'm having a little snack here,'" Batten told the Alaska Dispatch News. The incident and others prompted the Alaska Department of Fish and Game to warn residents that southcentral Alaska bears have not taken to winter dens and may be attracted to birdfeeders and cans of trash. Mild temperatures and little snow have led to bears hanging around, said Dave Battle, an assistant area wildlife biologist with the Department of Fish and Game. Bears want to load up on calories before denning, and bird seed and trash are a strong temptation, Battle said. 'It's most likely to stay out a bit longer, packing in the last calories that it can,' Battle said. Bird feeders should remain inside for a few more weeks, he said. Batten retired from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1998 and knows bear habits. 'As we used to say in the Fish and Wildlife Service, "Wait until Thanksgiving and then when you eat a bird you can feed a bird,"' he said. The Department of Fish and Game recommends southcentral Alaska residents keep bird feeders inside between April and November 1. Batten over the summer obtained a 'particularly nice' bird feeder and was anxious to hang it when November arrived. The state agency received other bear reports from Eagle River and even from the Government Hill neighborhood north of downtown Anchorage. 'Just because someone doesn't live in one of the areas mentioned doesn't mean it's safe for them to leave their trash unsecured or put out bird feeders,' Battle said.

chatgpt: Residents of Eagle River, Anchorage, were recently warned by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game not to let their guard down when it comes to staying safe around bears. The warning came after a resident named Bruce Batten captured a disturbing photograph of a bear right outside his home, eating from his birdfeeder. The incident occurred late last week, but it was just the latest in an alarming trend of bears not descending to their winter dens yet. With winter fast approaching, there are fears that this could lead to increased interactions between bears and humans. According to experts, bears usually enter their dens around October or November, hibernating throughout the winter months. However, this year has been different, with an unusually warm spell causing many bears to stay active and search for food. This has led to a number of dangerous encounters already, with residents across Anchorage reporting seeing bears around their homes and neighborhoods. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game is urging residents to stay vigilant and take precautions to avoid coming into contact with bears. This includes securing all food sources - including birdfeeders, garbage cans, and pet food - that may be attracting bears. They also recommend using bear-resistant trash cans if possible, and making sure any outdoor cooking or grilling is done well away from residential areas. In addition, residents are advised to carry bear spray whenever they leave their homes, especially when hiking or camping in bear territory. While the idea of living alongside bears may seem intimidating, it's important to remember that these animals are an important part of Alaska's ecosystem. However, to ensure the safety of both humans and bears, it's crucial to take these warnings seriously and do what we can to avoid dangerous interactions. As we move deeper into winter, experts will be closely monitoring the situation to ensure that bear activity remains within manageable levels. For now, however, it's clear that residents of Eagle River and beyond must remain cautious and prepared to protect themselves from these majestic yet potentially dangerous animals.
