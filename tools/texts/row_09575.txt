article: When filling in a form, most of us are happy to be either a Mr, Mrs or a Miss. But for those planning a visit to Lord’s, the choice is rather grander. Officials at the cricket ground have introduced an astonishing 52 titles for those registering online for tickets – including Viscount, Baron and Sheikh. Not to mention Queen, for the most important guest of all. Royally approved: Lord's cricket ground has a long list of titles among its fans, including Queen, seen here on first day of the second test between England and Australia in 2013 . They say they want to make all members of society feel welcome – though the majority of the list comprises aristocratic and religious titles and military ranks. The registration form for the 200-year-old ground offers an extensive list of salutations to make sure all fans can select the appropriate title for their tickets to this summer’s Ashes test matches. Other titles on offer include: Brigadier, Brother, Captain, Commander, Princess, Don, Father, Judge, Lord, Mademoiselle, Reverend, and Wing Commander. However, the list is by no means comprehensive, including earls and viscounts but not dukes. The military ranks also exclude admirals or generals. A spokesman for Lord’s said yesterday: ‘We have within our membership a complete cross-section of society, including the Queen who is a patron. Firm fan: The Queen watches the start of the second test of the Ashes between England and Australia in 2013 from the Pavilion at Lord's . Others who find the long list of titles useful are former cricketer Baroness Heyhoe Flint, and former Prime Minister Sir John Major, a well-known fan of the sport . ‘The membership committee took the decision that they wanted all members to be able to title themselves correctly.’ Usually ticket applications for sports events and concerts allow buyers to choose from just three titles – Mr, Mrs or Ms. But cricket fans entering the ballot to see the England internationals against Australia and also Test matches against New Zealand are free to select any title they wish...which is expected to encourage a few of the more mischievous members of the public to adopt titles that don’t belong to them. On the rare occasions that royalty attend Test matches – the Queen visited the Lord’s match against Australia in 2013 – it is unlikely they would opt to sit among the masses. The Queen, and other VIPs, would be seated in the pavilion and would not, of course, be required to buy tickets. The ballot for the Ashes Test with Australia, which starts on July 16, and a Test against New Zealand in May closed at one minute to midnight last night. The cricket ground, in North London, uses the ballot system as a fair way of allocating tickets for matches which are often oversubscribed, because it gives all applicants an equal opportunity. Lord’s was established in 1814 and is widely regarded as the Home of Cricket.
