article: The descendants of a Jewish family who owned a chain of department stores in Germany that were seized by the Nazis have been awarded £40 million in compensation. A Berlin court ordered that the payment should be made to the Schocken family, whose shops were lost during the so-called 'Aryanisation' of businesses in 1938. The family was already paid almost £12 million in compensation in the 1990s for one of the buildings that was seized, but say other property their family owned was undervalued. A former Schocken family department store in the city of Chemnitz, which was seized by the Nazis in 1938 . And the court ordered that the heirs to the business, who live in Israel and the United States should receive the additional cash. The Schocken chain of department stores were founded by brothers Simon and Salman Schocken in the early 1900s with their first outlet in Leipzig. Their business then went on to open 20 stores, mainly in the Saxony area of Germany. Salman Schocken became the sole owner of the family firm when his brother Simon died in a car crash in 1929. During the rise of the Nazis, Mr Schocken was politically forced to sell his department stores during the Aryanisation of German business. At this time, the Nazis forced non-Aryans, which were mainly Jews to surrender or sell their interests in Nazi Germany business life in a bid to deprive them of their wealth. One of the buildings which house a Schocken department store was recently transformed into the State Museum for Archaeology in Chemnizt, Germany . Schocken's best known building in the eastern city of Chemnitz was designed by the architect Erich Mendelsohn and now houses the State Museum of Archaeology. The family started to pursue their claim for compensation in 1994, meaning it took 20 years for them to be awarded full compensation. Family lawyer Bernd Wilhelm Schmitz told Bloomberg his clients were delighted with the ruling. He said: 'You find us very happy to finally have the Jewish victims compensated after almost a quarter of a century of legal battles. 'This hasn’t been a case like any other, moving us very much on a personal level as well.' A spokeswoman for the German Finance Ministry said they would be reviewing the written judgement on the case when it is released before deciding whether they should appeal.

chatgpt: The Schocken family, which owned a chain of department stores in Germany, has won a court order for £40 million in compensation after their shops were seized by the Nazis during the so-called 'Aryanisation' of businesses in 1938. The Schocken department store chain had been highly successful in Germany, but the family were forced to flee the country in 1939 when the Nazis came to power. During their exile, the Nazis seized their stores and stripped the family of their assets. Now, more than 80 years later, a court has ruled that the Schockens are entitled to £40 million in compensation from the German government. The decision was welcomed by the family, who said it was a "small amount of justice" for the losses they had suffered. However, the German Finance Ministry is reportedly considering whether to appeal the ruling. The ministry has argued that the compensation claim is statute-barred, as it was made more than 70 years after the stores were seized. The court ruling is significant, as it marks one of the largest compensation settlements for victims of Nazi persecution. While compensation payments have been made in the past, they have often been much smaller and have involved individual cases rather than entire families. The Schocken family's history is a testament to the devastating impact of Nazi persecution on Jewish-owned businesses in Germany. Many Jewish-owned stores were seized during the 'Aryanisation' of businesses in the late 1930s, which aimed to remove Jewish influence from the German economy. The move was part of a broader campaign of discrimination that saw Jews stripped of their rights and eventually deported to concentration camps. Many businesses were subsequently owned by non-Jewish Germans, who profited from the seizure of Jewish property. The fight for compensation for victims of Nazi persecution continues to this day. While the Schocken family's victory is a step forward, it highlights the ongoing struggle for recognition and restitution for those whose lives were destroyed by the horrors of the Holocaust.
