City watchdogs are probing allegations that foreign exchange rates are being rigged by traders. The investigation centres on claims that bank staff are making trades before processing customer orders, and also timing them to influence the setting of benchmark rates, according to a report by Bloomberg News. The accusations are a fresh blow to financial markets already embroiled in the Libor rate-fixing scandal - which has seen Barclays and RBS handed heavy fines. City watchdogs are probing allegations that foreign exchange rates are being rigged by traders. The accusations are a fresh blow to financial markets already embroiled in the Libor rate-fixing scandal - which has seen Barclays and RBS handed heavy fines . The market in natural gas faces a probe into manipulation of prices, and questions have been raised over oil and petrol prices. The £3trillion a day foreign exchange rate market is not regulated but the big players like banks are supervised by the Financial Conduct Authority. A spokesman for the watchdog said: 'We are looking into this but we can't comment any further at this moment'. The Bloomberg story reports claims that bank employees have been 'front-running' client orders and rigging WM/Reuters foreign exchange rates by pushing through trades before and during 60-second windows when benchmarks are set. Whistleblowing traders say that the alleged practices have been occurring on a daily basis for at least a decade, and have affected the value of funds and the complex financial instruments known as derivatives, according to Bloomberg. It also quotes an industry insider who likens the foreign exchange market to 'the Wild West'. RBS also had to stump up £390million for its part in the Libor scandal . While rates are not followed by ordinary investors directly, they are used by fund managers to calculate their holdings and index providers like FTSE Group and MSCI to track stocks and bonds. This means their movements can affect the value of pension and savings accounts. Barclays was hit with a £290million fine for manipulating the Libor interest rate last summer, when lurid emails were released showing how its traders boasted about their activities. RBS also had to stump up £390million for its part in the scandal. Meanwhile, BP and Royal Dutch Shell saw their offices raided last month as the European Commission launched an investigation into oil price fixing. The Commission said it was concerned there has been collusion aimed at manipulating the prices of not only oil, but also petrol and biofuels. Energy companies are also being investigated after accusations by a whistleblower that traders manipulated the wholesale gas price to boost profits, potentially pushing household bills higher.

chatgpt: Several bank staff members are being accused of making trades before processing customer orders, according to whistleblowing traders. This practice is occurring on a daily basis, with the foreign exchange market being likened to the Wild West by an industry insider. The allegations are centered around the idea that bank traders are using their insider knowledge to trade before client orders are processed, ultimately leading to a financial profit for the bank but potentially harming the customer. While this practice is not outright illegal, it is considered to be unethical and can be viewed as a conflict of interest. A whistleblower who spoke to the press about these accusations claimed that the practice was widespread and routine, stating that "it's just like they're placing bets on what the customer is going to do." This practice is also referred to as "front-running", and it allows the bank traders to take advantage of information that is not available to their clients. The foreign exchange market has long been considered a fast-paced and volatile industry by insiders, leading to comparisons with the Wild West. However, the recent allegations of unethical practices only serve to highlight the lack of regulation and oversight in the industry. While banks have denied engaging in this practice, investigations by regulatory authorities are likely to follow. The potential consequences could be significant, as banks could face large fines or legal action. In response to the allegations, some customers have voiced concern over the lack of transparency in the foreign exchange market. They worry that they may not be receiving the best possible deal from their bank, and that their orders could be influenced by the bank's own self-interest. This scandal highlights the need for increased regulation and oversight in the foreign exchange market. Without exposure and transparency, unethical practices could become more prevalent and potentially harm customers. It also underscores the importance of whistleblowers in exposing such practices and holding banks accountable for their actions. As investigations into these allegations continue, the foreign exchange industry may need to undergo significant changes in order to regain trust from both customers and regulatory bodies. For now, customers are advised to be cautious and to do their own research before engaging in trading activities with their banks.
