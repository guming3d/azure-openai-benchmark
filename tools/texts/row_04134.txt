article: New York (CNN)Around 100 potential jurors made their way into a Manhattan courtroom Monday morning, as Pedro Hernandez, alleged killer of 6-year-old Etan Patz, looked on. Hernandez, joined by his attorneys, Harvey Fishbein and Alice Fontier, sat in court opposite prosecutors from the Manhattan District Attorney's Office as jury selection for the criminal case began. In May 2012, Hernandez confessed to choking the boy to death in New York City in 1979, according to police. The potential jurors were asked to review a list of 131 names of potential witnesses and disclose whether they knew anyone on the list. "The publicity surrounding this case is ... unprecedented," said presiding Judge Maxwell Wiley, urging the possible jurors not to read any media reports on the case. You must "base your decision on what you hear in this courtroom and nothing else," Wiley instructed. Jury selection is expected to continue at least until the end of the week, with an additional 100 people expected to arrive Tuesday.  Ultimately, 12 people will be chosen to serve on the jury. The trial is expected to last approximately two to three months, Wiley said. Hernandez admitted to luring Etan, who was en route to a school bus stop, into the basement of a bodega where Hernandez worked as a stock clerk and killing him, according to police. The boy's body was put in a garbage bag and thrown away, Hernandez allegedly told authorities. The remains were never found. Fishbein previously argued that his client falsely confessed and the statements were not reliable because Hernandez has an "IQ in the borderline-to-mild mental retardation range," and had been repeatedly diagnosed with schizophrenia. But a judge ruled in November that Hernandez's confession would be admissible in court. The Patz case garnered national attention after the boy went missing, and his picture was plastered on thousands of milk cartons around the country. In November 2012, a grand jury indicted Hernandez on second-degree murder and kidnapping charges. He pleaded not guilty in court the following month.

chatgpt: In a case that has gripped the nation for decades, Pedro Hernandez is now standing trial for the alleged murder of 6-year-old Etan Patz back in 1979 in New York City. Hernandez confessed to the crime in 2012, but his lawyers are arguing that his low IQ and mental health issues render his confession inadmissible. After years of investigations and false leads, Hernandez, a former bodega worker, was arrested in 2012 for the murder of Patz. Hernandez told authorities that he lured the child into the basement of the bodega where he worked and strangled him. He then disposed of the boy's body in the trash like it was garbage. The confession stunned the city, bringing the decades-long searches for the missing boy to a close. However, questions about Hernandez's mental health have arisen since the initial confession. His lawyers say that he has an IQ of around 70, which puts him in the range of intellectual disability, and that he has a history of mental illness, including hallucinations and delusions. They argue that Hernandez's low IQ and mental health issues make his confession unreliable and that it should not be taken into account during the trial. Despite these claims, a judge ruled in November that Hernandez's confession was admissible in court. The judge noted that Hernandez had no prior criminal record and that his confession was made voluntarily after being read his Miranda rights. The trial began early this week, and prosecutors are expected to present the confession as evidence of Hernandez's guilt. The defense, on the other hand, says that it will present evidence showing that Hernandez's confession was false and coerced. The case has been closely watched not only because of the heinous nature of the crime but also because it is among the first high-profile child abduction cases in the United States. Etan Patz disappeared while walking to school in New York's SoHo neighborhood, starting a national campaign to find him that lasted for years. In the end, it was Hernandez's own admission that brought the case to a conclusion after more than three decades. As the trial unfolds, many are watching to see whether justice will finally be served for Etan Patz, and whether Hernandez will truly be held accountable for his alleged actions.
