article: Ingenious: The iPhone Gramophone uses a simple horn attached to a hardwood base to amplify the phone's tinny speakers by three or four times . For the mobile gadget enthusiast who nonetheless loves to have that period look at home, one U.S. designer has come up with the ultimate iPhone dock. The iPhone Gramophone borrows the iconic analogue horn speaker from the earliest sound playback devices and uses it to amplify the sound from Apple gadgets' weedy speakers. Simply place your iPad or iPhone in the solid walnut base and the metal horn will boost the volume of the gadget's speakers by three or four times - with no need for electricity. The retro device is the brainchild of Matt Richmond, a San Francisco-based furniture designer who built the original prototype from a Twenties horn speaker bought from an East Bay antiques shop. 'I found this old Victrola horn that had a shape I really loved, and I thought, "How cool would it be if I could use this with my phone?",' he said. 'I held up my phone to the opening on the speaker, and I could immediately tell it was something that would work.' Taking a heavy piece of hardwood, Mr Richmond carved a hole for the horn, a slot for his phone, and a channel to connect the two. The result was a elegant but functional iPhone speaker dock, with no battery or plug required. The nascent product needed little in the way of marketing: everyone who saw Mr Richmond's original device wanted one of their own and soon, after word reached the internet, he had more orders than he could hope to fill. So Mr Richmond refined his designs and teamed up with luxury brand Restoration Hardware to bring his product to a wider audience. Compatibility: With a base hand-crafted from solid walnut, the Gramophone accepts all iPhone models - the new connector on the iPhone 5 poses no technical problems for its iron and brass horn .

Like Mr Richmond's original prototype it needs no electricity or batteries, and so can be used wherever its owner bothers to heft it. However, its old-school amplification technology means its not for head bangers. 'It’s not overpowering, so it’s great in the background,' Mr Richmond said. 'And it’s directional – you can point the horn where you want the sound. If you put it in a corner it’ll really fill a room.' The iPhone Gramophone is available online from Restoration Hardware for $249 (£155)

chatgpt: Attention music lovers! A new gadget has hit the shelves that might take you back to the old-school days of audio enjoyment. In a world where sleek, portable wireless speakers are all the rage, the horn speaker has made a big comeback. Made popular in the early 1900s, horn speakers were the primary means of amplifying sound before the advent of electric microphones and amplifiers. Nowadays, we have smartphones with built-in speakers that we love to carry around and stream music from. But what if you could enhance the audio output of your phone without sacrificing convenience and portability? That's where the horn speaker comes in. This device works by acoustically amplifying the sound produced by the iPhone speakers, resulting in a richer and louder audio experience. Unlike traditional speakers that use electronic amplification, horn speakers use a physical amplification method. The sound waves produced by your iPhone are funneled through the horn-shaped device, which increases their volume and projects them outward. The result is a natural and organic sound that's reminiscent of vinyl records and vintage radios. One of the major advantages of using a horn speaker is its portability. This device is small enough to fit in your bag or even your pocket, making it ideal for music on the go. You don't have to worry about cumbersome cables or charging pads; all you need is your iPhone and the horn speaker. It's perfect for travelers, hikers, and anyone who wants to enjoy high-quality music without the need for bulky equipment. Another benefit of the horn speaker is its energy efficiency. Since it doesn't require any batteries, electricity, or other sources of power, you won't have to worry about replacing or recharging anything. It also means that you can use it anywhere, anytime, without being tethered to a wall socket or USB port. Whether you're at a picnic, a beach party, or a camping trip, your horn speaker will keep your music flowing all night long. While the horn speaker may not be the latest and greatest gadget on the market, it certainly has its charms. It's a throwback to a simpler time when music was more analog and less digital. It's also a testament to the ingenuity of inventors and engineers who found creative ways to amplify sound in the early days of audio technology. And for anyone who values quality over quantity, the horn speaker is a must-have accessory. So if you're looking for a new way to enjoy your music without sacrificing mobility or convenience, consider getting a horn speaker for your iPhone. It may not be the most high-tech gadget out there, but it certainly has a lot of old-school charm. Who knows, maybe you'll discover a newfound appreciation for the warm, rich tones of acoustic amplification.
