chatgpt: A Scottish prankster has left social media users baffled after his latest video appears to show him flying alongside a car like a superhero. Kevin Hannaway, a 24-year-old from Glasgow, posted the video online, which shows him outside the vehicle seemingly floating along a country lane. According to Hannaway, he was on his bike when he decided to film the stunt. In the video, he can be seen holding onto the side door of the van as it drives alongside him. He then lifts himself up and floats alongside the vehicle, with his arms spread out like wings. Hannaway is no stranger to creating funny videos online. He says that he loves coming up with new ideas for films that will make people laugh. However, this latest stunt has drawn criticism from motoring group the AA, who have warned others not to try and copy the dangerous stunt. A spokesperson for the AA said: "We would advise people not to imitate this stunt, which could easily result in serious injury or worse. We cannot stress enough the importance of staying safe on the roads, and we would urge anyone who witnesses dangerous driving or stunts to report it to the authorities." Despite the warning, Hannaway's video has garnered thousands of views on social media, with many users praising his creativity and sense of humour. Some have even suggested that he should consider a career in stunts or special effects. Hannaway says that he never intended to cause any harm or put himself in danger, and that he only did it for the sake of comedy. He claims that he took all necessary precautions, and that he had practiced the stunt several times before filming it. However, the AA has warned that even the slightest mistake could lead to serious injury, and that anyone attempting a similar stunt could face criminal charges. This is not the first time that Hannaway has created buzz online. He has previously posted videos of himself taking part in various pranks and stunts, including jumping into a shopping trolley and pretending to be a superhero fighting crime on the streets of Glasgow. Despite the warning from the AA, Hannaway says that he has no plans to stop creating fun and entertaining videos for his fans. He says that he enjoys making people laugh, and that he will continue to come up with new and creative ideas for his followers to enjoy. In the end, Hannaway's video serves as a reminder that, while it may be fun to experiment with stunts and special effects, it's important to always put safety first. As the AA warns, even the slightest mistake could lead to serious injury or worse, and it's not worth risking your life for the sake of a few laughs.
