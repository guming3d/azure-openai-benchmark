article: E-readers may be a relatively new phenomenon but historians claim a Spanish teacher first came up with the idea more than 60 years ago. Forward-thinking Ángela Ruiz Robles invented her Mechanical Encyclopedia in 1949 - more than half a century before the advent of Kindles, Kobos and Nooks. Her main goal was to reduce the weight of books in students' school bags, and she firmly believed the gadget would make reading more accessible to all. Pioneer: Ángela Ruiz Robles invented her Mechanical Encyclopedia in 1949 - some half a century before the Kindles, Kobos and Nooks literature lovers enjoy today . The device worked with pressurised air, allowing readers to add different spools containing the pre-loaded content. It may be well away from the current format of downloading books from the internet, but in a world without the web it was deemed revolutionary. Ruiz, who was at the time aged 54, applied for a patent. Her rather concise application said: 'It has some coils where you place the books that you want to learn in whatever language. 'By a movement of the same [the coils] it passes over all the topics, making it stop where you would like it to.' It also reportedly had a 'zoom' function where readers could focus in on a particular area of the text. María José Rodríguez Fortiz, language professor at the University of Granada, said she also had plans to add a reading light, sound and a hole to place a calculator. But none of these ideas made it to the first prototype. Ángela Ruiz Robles' technology was a million miles away from the e-readers we have today, such as the Kindle, but the core concept was the same . Sadly, the mother-of-three's invention never reached the market as she could not find the right level of funding for her project. Rodríguez told Spanish media: 'There were other priorities in the country and they went for other projects. 'Furthermore, the implementation of all the specifications of the invention was impractical. 'In her later years Ángela tried to resurrect the project, when everything was technologically viable. But she did not manage to secure public or private funding.' Ruiz, born in 1895 in Vallamanín, León, moved to the town of Ferrol in Galicia as a youngster where she spent most of her life. She died in her 80s. The prototype is now in the National Museum of Science and Technology in La Coruña, whose director Ramón Núñez said that Ruiz was 'unique, not only in Spain, but in the world.' He added: 'It is easy to see that there are very few women who have dared to enter their ideas for inventions and innovations. 'For her exceptional character, the fact that she is not well known is very serious.'

chatgpt: Ángela Ruiz Robles, a Spanish teacher and inventor, is credited with the creation of the "Mechanical Encyclopedia," an early prototype of what we know today as the e-reader. The device, invented in the late 1940s, was a handheld book-sized apparatus that used spools and pressurized air to turn its pages, and could display pictures and text in a "zoom" feature, allowing readers to magnify the printed text.  However, Ms. Ruiz Robles saw even greater potential for her innovative device. She had plans to add sound, a reading light, and even a calculator. Unfortunately, her efforts to secure financial backing for her invention were unsuccessful.  Despite the limitations of the time period, Ms. Ruiz Robles' invention represented a major step forward in the book industry. Prior to her innovation, books were printed on heavy paper and were often difficult to transport, especially for those who had to carry large numbers of them on a regular basis, such as students and professionals.  Ms. Ruiz Robles' device not only made reading more portable, but it also had implications for accessibility. The Mechanical Encyclopedia had the potential to make printed material accessible for people with visual impairments, a concept that was ahead of its time.  It's important to remember that Ms. Ruiz Robles was not working in a vacuum. In the mid-1940s, a number of researchers, including Vannevar Bush, were investigating ways to create a "memex," a device that would store and retrieve information electronically. This represented a significant shift in thinking, as it allowed for a single device to store vast amounts of information, making knowledge sharing more efficient than ever before. In this context, Ms. Ruiz Robles' invention represented a significant step forward. Not only did her "Mechanical Encyclopedia" offer portability, it was also a way to store and retrieve information in a more efficient manner. Unfortunately, despite her vision and innovation, Ms. Ruiz Robles was unable to secure the financial backing she needed to take her invention to the next level. As a result, the concept of the e-reader would not become a reality until several decades later, when the advent of digital technology allowed for a device that could store and display vast amounts of information. Today, Ms. Ruiz Robles' invention is celebrated as an early precursor to the modern e-reader. In 2013, Google even honored her with a Doodle that showcased her Mechanical Encyclopedia. It's a reminder that even when an idea is ahead of its time, it can inspire others to push the boundaries of what is possible.  In conclusion, Ángela Ruiz Robles' "Mechanical Encyclopedia" was a groundbreaking invention that paved the way for the development of the e-reader. Although she was not able to secure the financial backing she needed to take her invention to the next level, her vision and innovation are still celebrated by those who recognize the importance of portable, accessible information. Her legacy can be seen in the myriad digital devices that we take for granted today, but it's important to remember that someone had to take the first step. That someone was Ángela Ruiz Robles.
