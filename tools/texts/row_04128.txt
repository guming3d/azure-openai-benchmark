article: (CNN) -- The alleged victim in a 1977 sexual assault case against director Roman Polanski has filed court papers seeking dismissal of the charges against him. Oscar-winning director Roman Polanski has lived in exile in France since fleeing the United States in 1978. The woman's declaration seeking dismissal was filed Monday in Los Angeles, California, in connection with Polanski's efforts to have the 31-year-old case dismissed. Polanski, 75, has lived in exile in France since fleeing the United States in 1978 after pleading guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse. Polanski admitted to having sex with a 13-year-old girl, and an arrest warrant against him remains in effect. In her declaration, Samantha Geimer said, "I am no longer a 13-year-old child. I have dealt with the difficulties of being a victim, have surmounted and surpassed them with one exception. "Every time this case is brought to the attention of the Court, great focus is made of me, my family, my mother and others. That attention is not pleasant to experience and is not worth maintaining over some irrelevant legal nicety, the continuation of the case." Geimer, who has spoken publicly about the case before, including a 2003 appearance on CNN's "Larry King Live," added, "I have survived, indeed prevailed, against whatever harm Mr. Polanski may have caused me as a child." She chided the district attorney's office for not dismissing the case earlier and for "yet once again (giving) great publicity to the lurid details of those events, for all to read again. True as they may be, the continued publication of those details cause harm to me ... I have become a victim of the actions of the District Attorney." The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office had no immediate response to Geimer's declaration. Lawyers for the Oscar-winning film director filed a motion for dismissal of the sex offense case against him in December, citing what the defense called "extraordinary new evidence" of "repeated, unlawful and unethical misconduct" by the Los Angeles district attorney's office and the judge in Polanski's case. The December motion also argued that Polanski should not be required to return to the United States to appear in court for the dismissal motion to be considered. In her declaration, Geimer said if Polanski cannot appear in court, she will do so to seek dismissal. "My position is absolutely clear," she said. Polanski's motion for dismissal is scheduled for a hearing on January 21. Polanski, a native of Poland, won the Academy Award in 2003 for his Holocaust drama, "The Pianist." Among his other films from earlier in his career are "Rosemary's Baby" and "Chinatown." His first wife, actress Sharon Tate, was murdered by the Charles Manson family in 1969.

chatgpt: A motion has been filed to dismiss a 31-year-old sex offense case against the acclaimed director Roman Polanski, who has been living in exile in France since fleeing the United States in the late 70s. Polanski was accused of having unlawful intercourse with a 13-year-old girl in 1977, and the case has been ongoing ever since. He pleaded guilty to the offense in 1978 but fled the country before sentencing, fearing a harsh penalty. Despite being absent from the US for over three decades, Polanski continued to face extradition efforts, with the case dragging on over the years. However, the latest bid to dismiss the case cites recent legal developments, including a ruling from a California appeals court that said Polanski had already served his time in custody and on house arrest for the offense. The legal team representing the director argues that, given these developments, there is no justification for continuing the case. They believe that Polanski has effectively resolved the charges against him and should not be subject to any further legal action. While some have spoken out in support of Polanski, others have criticized the move to dismiss the case. Those who oppose the director argue that dismissing the charge would send a message that the wealthy and powerful can avoid justice by exploiting legal loopholes and fleeing the country. This case has been a highly controversial issue for many years, with Polanski's supporters arguing that he has already suffered enough for his offense and that he should be allowed to return to the US without facing further legal action. However, critics believe that his avoidance of justice for so long is unacceptable, regardless of the time that has passed since the offense occurred. Polanski has long been one of the most highly-regarded directors in the film industry, his work spanning decades and encompassing a wide range of critically acclaimed films. However, this controversy has followed him throughout his career, and there are some who believe that his legacy will forever be tainted by his past actions. As of now, it remains to be seen whether the motion to dismiss the case against Polanski will be successful, or whether the director will one day face justice for his offense. For now, the debate over his past actions, as well as the larger issue of justice and accountability, continues to rage on.
