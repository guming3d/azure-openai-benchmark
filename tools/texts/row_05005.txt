chatgpt: Manchester United's pre-season tour of the USA has been full of excitement on and off the pitch, and the latest incident involves defender Phil Jones forgetting his wallet during a free afternoon. Thankfully, his fitness coach, Tony Strudwick, kindly paid for two cab journeys and a coffee for the forgetful player.  Strudwick took to Twitter to poke fun at Jones' forgetful nature, tweeting: "Just lent Phil Jones money for a taxi...he's probably lost his wallet again #muppet." The fitness coach's joke didn't stop there as Ashley Young, the United winger, also joined in on the fun, jokingly tweeting that it was "no shock" that the Red Devils had won the International Champions Cup against Liverpool in the USA. Jones is known for being forgetful, having previously misplaced his passport before a Champions League match against Valencia. His forgetfulness has also been a topic of discussion amongst his teammates, with former United player Rio Ferdinand previously revealing that Jones once asked if they played in red or blue after a match. Despite Jones' forgetful nature, he remains an important player for Manchester United. The 26-year-old has made over 200 appearances for the club since joining in 2011 and was a key player in the team's Europa League triumph in 2017. The incident has brought a light-hearted moment to what has been a grueling pre-season tour for United. The team played six matches across America, with their final match against Liverpool being the highlight of the tour, as they won the International Champions Cup in style, defeating their arch-rivals 2-1. Manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has been impressed with his team's performances during the tour, with the Premier League season set to start on August 9th. United will be hoping to build on their strong form in the USA, and with the likes of Jones in their squad, they certainly have a chance of success. In conclusion, Jones' forgetfulness has once again been the topic of discussion amongst his teammates, with Strudwick and Young having a light-hearted joke at his expense. However, the incident has brought some light-hearted fun to what has been a successful pre-season tour for Manchester United, who will be hoping to bring that success into the upcoming Premier League season.
