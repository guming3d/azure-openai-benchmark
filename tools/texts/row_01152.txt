article: Baghdad (CNN) -- Iraq may reactivate long-idle pipelines to get its oil to world markets if tensions over neighboring Iran result in the closure of the Strait of Hormuz, a government spokesman said Sunday. The plans include shipping more oil to Turkey's port of Ceyhan and reopening pipelines that could deliver Iraqi crude to ports in Syria, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia, government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh said in a statement released from his office. Iran is resisting international calls to suspend its uranium enrichment work and demonstrate that its nuclear program remains solely peaceful. The Islamic republic has warned that it will close the Strait of Hormuz if threatened, shutting down access to the Gulf. Oil is the source of more than 90% of Iraq's budget. About 80% of the 2.2 million barrels of oil Iraq exports daily flows through the strait, along with about 20% of world oil production. Iraq's Cabinet approved several recommendations for finding alternatives to shipping oil out of the southern port of Basra through the Persian Gulf, al-Dabbagh said. If the sea route were cut off, Iraq could increase production through its pipeline from Kirkuk to Ceyhan and ship more oil aboard tanker trucks in the short term, he said.

But in the long run, a government committee recommended reopening a pipeline into Syria and Lebanon that was shut down by the insurgency that followed the U.S. invasion in 2003 and another pipeline to Saudi Arabia's Red Sea port of Yanbu that has been idled since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990. But Iraqi infrastructure deteriorated during the sanctions that followed the invasion of Kuwait, and putting those back into service could take years, Iraq's oil ministry has said. The Yanbu pipeline was built during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, when both countries targeted tankers coming in and out of each other's ports. The committee also recommended building a new pipeline that would connect Iraqi oil fields to Jordan's port of Aqaba, also on the Red Sea, al-Dabbah said.

chatgpt: As tensions between the United States and Iran continue to escalate in the Persian Gulf, Iraq is considering its options in the event that the Strait of Hormuz is closed to oil tankers. Oil provides more than 90% of Iraq's budget, with about four-fifths of its exports flowing through the strait. The potential closure of the important waterway could spell disaster for the country's economy. In the face of such a possibility, Iraqi officials are exploring alternative routes for their oil exports. One option being considered is the use of old pipelines that run from Kirkuk to the Turkish port of Ceyhan. These pipelines were previously used to transport oil during the Saddam Hussein era but fell out of use after the US-led invasion in 2003. Restoring these pipelines could provide a vital alternative route for Iraq's oil exports, allowing the country to bypass the Strait of Hormuz entirely. However, significant investment would be required to repair the infrastructure and bring it up to modern standards. Iraq is also exploring the possibility of new pipeline projects that would allow it to transport oil to other ports in the Gulf, such as Oman and Kuwait. These projects would require significant investment and would take years to complete. Despite the challenges, Iraqi officials are keen to explore all options to ensure the continued flow of oil exports from the country. The closure of the Strait of Hormuz would not only affect Iraq's economy but would also have wider ramifications on the global oil market. Already, tensions in the region have pushed up oil prices, with Brent crude rising above $74 a barrel in recent weeks. If the strait were to be closed, it is likely that prices would rise further, potentially causing significant economic disruption. As such, Iraq's exploration of alternative routes for its oil exports is not only crucial for the country itself but also for the stability of the global oil market. With tensions in the region showing no signs of abating, it is likely that Iraq's efforts to secure alternative routes will continue in the coming months.
