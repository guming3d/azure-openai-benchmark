article: By . Lauren Paxman . UPDATED: . 08:30 EST, 7 March 2012 . A cheap antibiotic usually used to treat acne could alleviate the symptoms of schizophrenia, international studies have found. The National Institute for Health . Research will start 175 recruiting patients for a £1.9m UK trial of the drug, minocycline, next month. The study comes after a chance observation in Japan caused researchers to test the drug in patients with schizophrenia first in Japan itself, and then all over the world. Trials have already been held in Israel, Pakistan and Brazil where schizophrenic patients treated with the drug showed significant improvement.

Minocycline has anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects which could account for the positive findings. The first account of the antibiotic's positive effects appeared in 2007, when a 23-year-old Japanese man was admitted to hospital suffering from persecutory delusions and paranoid ideas. The subject had no psychiatric history and blood tests and brain scans showed nothing unusual. He was started on halperidol a powerful anti-psychotic drug, but it had no effect. However when he developed severe pneumonia a week later and was prescribed the antibiotic the infection was cleared and the psychosis resolved within two months. However, minocycline does not work as a cure. Effective treatment? Minocycline has anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects . When the patient stopped taking the drug, his psychiatric symptoms got worse again. But another treatment with minocyline made him better again. The UK trial will recruit patients recently diagnosed with schizophrenia, Jeremy Laurance, a member of the Schizophrenia Commission, told The Independent. Half the patients will take minocycline with their standard anti-psychotic treatment, the other half will take a placebo. Brain scans will be carried out at the beginnning and end of the year-long trial to compare loss of grey matter which is an effect of schizophrenia. Tests will also measure inflammatory markers in the blood. Paul Jenkins, CEO of the charity Rethink Mental Illness told MailOnline:  'We welcome the early promise shown by minocycline in treating psychosis in people with schizophrenia. 'Nowhere near enough time or money currently goes into to researching treatments for schizophrenia or other serious mental illnesses, which cause pain and suffering for many thousands of families across the UK.'

chatgpt: A new lead has been discovered in the fight against one of the most debilitating diseases in the world. This comes after a man suffering from paranoia was treated with antibiotics for pneumonia and a link was discovered. The treatment seemed to not only cure the pneumonia but also alleviate his paranoia.  This breakthrough has led the National Institute for Health Research to start a £1.9m study next month with the hopes of uncovering more about this link. Currently, millions of people around the world suffer from a range of mental illnesses, including anxiety, depression, and paranoia. While treatment options are available, such as medication and therapy, these often come with side effects or limited efficacy.  The new discovery has opened up a new pathway in the search for a cure. The man's treatment involved targeting the bacterial infection causing the pneumonia, which in turn seemed to have a beneficial effect on his mental health.  Experts speculate that the possibility of a connection between the gut and the brain is the reason behind the observed effects. Research has shown that there is a significant link between the two, with changes in the gut microbiome affecting brain function and behavior.  The study aims to investigate this link further by exploring the effects of different types of antibiotics on mental health. The researchers will be conducting a randomized controlled trial, involving patients with different mental illnesses. They will investigate the effects of antibiotics targeting specific bacteria on the gut microbiome and the resulting changes in mental health.  The study has the potential to revolutionize the treatment options available to patients with mental illnesses. By understanding the link between the gut and the brain, it may be possible to develop targeted treatments that alleviate symptoms while minimizing side effects.  This has been a welcome development in the fight against mental illness, which has long been stigmatized and misunderstood. It is hoped that this study will contribute to a greater understanding of the causes of mental illness and lead to more effective treatments.  The study is set to begin next month, and researchers are optimistic about what they may uncover. While there is still much to be learned about the connection between the gut and the brain, this breakthrough represents an important step forward in the search for a cure.  In conclusion, the discovery of a link between antibiotic treatment and mental illness marks a new beginning in the search for more effective treatments. The upcoming study by the National Institute for Health Research will investigate this link further, potentially leading to better targeted treatments that alleviate symptoms while minimizing side effects. With millions of people around the world suffering from mental illnesses, this research is much-needed and will hopefully go some way in improving the quality of life of those affected.
