article: Menacing storm clouds gather over green fields and quiet roads, about to embark on a path of destruction. Like a spaceship hovering above the earth, the cylindrical formation spells trouble for anything in its wake. As it sinks closer to the earth, clouds of golden dust are kicked up beneath the gloom by the tornado's rotating force. It's called Tornado Alley for a reason: The car and trees in this photo are dwarfed by the gigantic cloud . Storm chaser Marko Korosec, 31, was on an expedition in the USA for 26 days when he came across these cloud formations. Marko, a system administrator for road weather information, snapped the shots of the three storms in Tornado Alley in Texas, Kansas and Colorado. From a distance of 1km, he observed the scene for at least an hour at a time, saying the tornados ripped up trees and telephone wires on their journeys. The alley's unique conditions mean tornados form frequently here. On Cloud Nine: Storm chaser Marko Korosec could not believe his luck when he saw these incredible cloud formations . Dust to dust: Huge dust clouds merge with this cloud as it moves across the valley . The sun appears to be consumed by the cloud, sucked up by a giant, spinning vortex . Warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico meets cold, dry air from the Rocky Mountains and Canada, creating intense, tornado-producing thunderstorms known as supercells. Supercell storms contain a rotating tower, called a mesocyclone, giving the clouds a circular spaceship look. Marko, from Sezana, Slovenia, said: 'Storm chasing is dangerous as intense lightning, large hail, strong winds and tornadoes could pose threats at any time. 'I usually observe storms in as safe a position as possible, to avoid any dangerous conditions which could cause us damage or to the vehicle. 'It usually takes no more than an hour to form a supercell storm which usually brings down trees amd telephone wires. 'Hail can also damage roads and buildings, so it's important to stay at least 1km away. 'Storm chasing usually means a lot of moving around, remaining in one position for some time and then moving when storm gets closer.' The fluffiest UFO in the universe! This cloud takes on a disc shape similar to classic flying saucers from 1950s sci-fi films . Sky's the limit: This startling cloud mass completely dominates the sky above the fields .

chatgpt: Scientists and weather experts have reported the sighting of a foreboding phenomena over three US states. Residents of Texas, Kansas, and Colorado were amongst the first to observe the atypical weather formation. According to eyewitnesses, the phenomena was visible from a safe distance, as the skies were illuminated by a series of unnatural colors. Despite the awe-inspiring sight, the experts warn that such occurrences could be harbingers of severe weather events. While the natural phenomenon demonstrated an array of colors, with a broad spectrum ranging from reds and oranges, to blues and greens, no actual cause has been pinpointed to explain its appearance. Scientists, however, believe that it was most likely a result of atmospheric interferences such as dust or atmospheric pollution. “The special conditions that produce such phenomena are still being studied, and the mechanisms behind them are still not fully understood. However, it is clear that weather patterns play a significant role in creating these phenomena,” said Brian Jackson, a Research Scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The strange phenomenon has sparked discussions among experts, many of whom suspect that something may be amiss with the planet’s climate patterns. Some are calling for increased measures to monitor the natural environment and keep a closer eye on these phenomena in order to better understand them. Several experts have also cautioned that the unusual weather patterns could have a serious impact on the regions where they appear. Such weather patterns are often associated with extreme changes in temperature, precipitation, and other environmental factors, which could lead to natural disasters such as floods, droughts, or even hurricanes and tornadoes. Despite the concerns, the sighting of the foreboding phenomena has been celebrated by many as a rare and beautiful sight. The natural display has captured the imagination of people across the globe and has led to calls for further research and scientific exploration. “We must continue to explore and study the intricate and complex workings of our planet’s climate systems in order to gain a better understanding of the natural world around us,” said Jackson. “Only then can we make informed decisions and take meaningful actions to address the challenges we face in the decades ahead.”
