article: Outgoing Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley took the state's last four inmates off death row Wednesday, commuting their sentences to life in prison without parole in one of his final acts in office. The move comes as the Democrat considers a run for president -- a long-shot bid that many Democrats only expect to gain steam if Hillary Clinton opts not to run. O'Malley's office announced the move in a release Wednesday morning, noting that the state's legislature had abolished the death penalty with a law that took effect in May 2013 and that the state's courts and attorney general have questioned whether the state has legal authority to carry out death sentences that were already imposed. "In the final analysis, there is one truth that stands between and before all of us," O'Malley said in a statement. "That truth is this -- few of us would ever wish for our children or grandchildren to kill another human being or to take part in the killing of another human being. The legislature has expressed this truth by abolishing the death penalty in Maryland." The four inmates whose sentences were commuted are Vernon Lee Evans Jr. and Anthony Grandison Sr., who were convicted of the 1983 contract killing of two witnesses scheduled to testify in a federal drug trial; Heath William Burch, convicted of killing an elderly neighbor couple in 1995; and Jody Lee Miles, convicted of robbing and shooting a theater manager in 1997. O'Malley said in the statement that he'd met with the families of the victims of the four convicted killers whose sentences he commuted, and said they would suffer through "the additional torment of an un-ending legal process." "In my judgment, leaving these death sentences in place does not serve the public good of the people of Maryland -- present or future," O'Malley said. "Gubernatorial inaction -- at this point in the legal process -- would, in my judgment, needlessly and callously subject survivors, and the people of Maryland, to the ordeal of an endless appeals process, with unpredictable twists and turns, and without any hope of finality or closure," he said.

chatgpt: Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley made his final act in office by commuting the state's only four remaining death sentences on Wednesday. The move comes just days before he is set to leave the office and as he is considered for a presidential bid in the 2016 Democratic primaries.  O'Malley's action is a result of the state legislature's decision in 2013 to abolish the death penalty. In a statement released on Wednesday, the governor stated that he believed the death penalty was a "flawed system that does not represent justice." He continued, "In my judgement, leaving these death sentences in place would result in the state's taking a fatally flawed legal approach to a moral question." The decision to commute the sentences was met with mixed reactions from Maryland residents. Some applauded the governor for taking a strong stance against the death penalty, while others expressed concern that those convicted of heinous crimes would now spend their lives in prison instead of facing the ultimate punishment.  Supporters of the death penalty argue that it serves as a deterrent to violent crime and provides justice for victims and their families. However, opponents of the death penalty argue that it is an ineffective and expensive system that does not always result in justice and can lead to a wrongful conviction.  Maryland's abolition of the death penalty was a long and contentious process. The state first abolished the death penalty in 1968, but then reinstated it in 1978. Since then, the state has only executed five people.  Governor O'Malley's action on Wednesday marks a significant step toward the phasing out of the death penalty in the United States. As of January 2021, 27 states have abolished the death penalty, and there are currently only 49 people on death row in Maryland, which now has a life without parole option for those convicted of first-degree murder.  With his term coming to an end and a potential presidential bid looming, O'Malley's decision to commute the state's remaining death sentences could have an impact on his political future. Some analysts believe that the move will be seen as a sign of his progressive values, while others argue that it could hurt him with more conservative voters. Only time will tell the full impact of this decision.
