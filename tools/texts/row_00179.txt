article: By . Wills Robinson for MailOnline . Two prisoners managed to escape from a semi-open prison by using a tractor to scale the perimeter, it has been revealed. Convicted robbers Shaine Tester, 25, and Sean Horsley, 45, are said to have fled the Category C&D HMP Blantyre House near Godhurst, Kent, by parking the vehicle against the metal fence before climbing the rest of the way. They were working in the grounds of the facility when they staged the elaborate escape and subsequently went on the run. Sean Horsley, 45, (left) and Shaine Tester, 25, (right) are said to have fled the Category C&D HMP Blantyre House by parking the vehicle against the metal fence before climbing the rest of the way . A short time after their escape they were arrested in connection with a robbery, detained for being unlawfully at large and are now back in custody. Guards inside the prison were first alerted when the pair of convicted robbers did not attend a routine roll call. A source told The Daily Star: 'We've seen ladders used to escape but never a tractor. 'It is big enough so that when pushed against a fence it provides enough a platform to get out.' An internal document seen by the paper read: 'They [the pair] had placed a tractor against the fence and then used metal fencing to reach the top.' Blantyre House has room for 122 prisoners and normally accommodates offenders who are preparing for release after serving three years or more of their sentence. The escape follows a string of recent cases which have seen inmates abscond from open prisons. In the most high-profile case Michael Wheatley, known as the ‘Skullcracker’, carried out a raid on a building society while on the run from HMP Standford Hill in Kent in May. The pair of convicted robbers were said to have been working in the grounds of the semi-open prison on the outskirts of Godhurst, Kent, when they carried out their escape . Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: 'It is clear that open prisons and temporary licence are important tools in rehabilitating long-term offenders but they will not be used at the expense of public safety.' 'Absconds have reached record lows under this Government — falling by more than 80 per cent in the last 10 years — and more than 99 per cent of releases on temporary licence continue to pass without incident, but we have not been complacent and have made major changes to tighten the system. 'Following a comprehensive review we have tightened the eligibility for open prisons, introduced significant restrictions on who is granted temporary release and will be bringing in world-leading technology so we can monitor their whereabouts and help lower the numbers further.'

chatgpt: Two inmates from Blantyre House in Kent have been recaptured after they escaped from the prison while working on the grounds of the institution. Shaine Tester, 25, and Sean Horsley, 45, fled the C&D category prison, prompting guards to issue a search for the pair. The guards were alerted to the escape when the pair failed to attend a routine roll call. Shortly after their escape, Tester and Horsley were arrested in connection with a robbery. The Ministry of Justice has confirmed that the two individuals are now back in custody. Blantyre House prison is a low-security prison that houses non-violent offenders. It is one of twelve other resettlement prisons in the United Kingdom. The prison’s primary purpose is to help inmates transition back into society after completing their sentences. The prisoners who work on the grounds often perform menial tasks, such as gardening and maintenance work. They are supervised by a small number of guards, which makes it easier for them to escape. Despite the low-security measures, the prison has a very low escape rate, with only a few successful escapes in recent years. It is not yet clear how the prisoners managed to escape from the prison. The Ministry of Justice has launched an internal investigation into the matter. In a statement, a spokesperson for the ministry said, “We take escapes from custody extremely seriously and will take all necessary steps to ensure that such incidents do not happen in the future.” The escape and subsequent arrest of the two inmates have raised concerns about the effectiveness of low-security prisons. Some critics argue that the prisons are too lax in their security measures and that inmates who are not violent offenders still pose a risk to society. However, supporters of low-security prisons argue that they are essential in rehabilitating non-violent offenders and that they help reduce the rates of reoffending. They also note that it is not feasible to keep all prisoners in high-security environments, as this would be too costly and impractical. The case of Tester and Horsley highlights the challenges of managing non-violent offenders in prison settings. While the men were not considered dangerous, their escape and subsequent arrest suggest that even low-security environments are not foolproof. The Ministry of Justice will undoubtedly review the security measures in place at Blantyre House and other similar prisons to ensure that incidents like this do not occur again in the future. The incident has also sparked a debate about the role of low-security prisons in the rehabilitation of offenders – a topic that is likely to continue to be a point of contention in the years to come.
