Adam Matos was located at a hotel in Tampa, where he was taken into custody with a SWAT team surrounding the building. The arrest came after detectives spent several days tracking Matos, who was reportedly on the run after allegedly killing his ex-girlfriend, her father, her new boyfriend, and their son. The deaths sent shock waves through the neighborhood, leaving residents on edge and authorities on high alert. After his arrest, police made a disturbing discovery at the hotel - Matos' four-year-old son, Ismael, who had been missing for over a week. The boy's whereabouts had been a source of concern, and authorities were desperate to locate him before it was too late. Thankfully, Ismael was found unharmed and has since been reunited with his maternal grandparents. The child's mother, Megan Brown, was one of the four victims Matos is accused of killing.
