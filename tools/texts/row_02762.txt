article: (CNN) -- Asiana Airlines Flight 214 passenger Ye Mengyuan was alive when flung from the plane during this month's crash landing but was killed moments later when run over by a rescue vehicle, a California coroner said Friday. Ye died as result of "multiple blunt injuries that are consistent with being run over by a motor vehicle," said San Mateo County Coroner Robert Foucrault. "Those injuries she received, she was alive at the time." Officials previously had said that was what they feared had happened after the crash on July 6 at San Francisco's airport. Ye, 16, of China was one of three people who died in the crash and its aftermath. Read more: Asiana crash probe moved on from SFO . San Francisco Fire Department Chief Joanne Hayes-White, attending a news conference with Foucrault, called the incident "a tragic accident" and apologized to Ye's family. One of the department's aircraft rescue and firefighting vehicles struck the girl while she was on the ground, possibly covered with firefighting foam being sprayed on and around the burning plane, the chief said. "I particularly want to express our condolences and apologies to the family of Ye Mengyuan in light of the coroners' findings (in) this tragic accident," the chief said. "Obviously this is very difficult news for us. We're heartbroken. We're in the business of saving lives," she added. "There's not a lot of words to describe how badly we feel about it." The fire department is reaching out to the family through the Chinese consulate's office. The investigation of what happened after the crash remains with the city's police department. Police are reconstructing the crash scene to ascertain what happened during the rescue, the chief said. She called the crash "a difficult, challenging scene." "We believe it was one of the specialized rigs at the airport, the ARFF rigs, aircraft rescue firefighting vehicles," Hayes-White said. San Francisco Mayor Edwin M. Lee said he was "profoundly saddened by the involvement of a responding emergency vehicle in the death of 16-year-old Ye Mengyuan." "On behalf of the people of San Francisco, I offer my deepest condolences and regret for her tragic death, and the deaths of her close friend, Wang Linjia, and 15-year-old Liu Yipeng," the mayor said in a statement. Ye and Wang, also 16, were part of a group of 35 teachers and students from a middle school in Jiangshan traveling to California for a summer camp program. Wang was found dead at the scene along with Ye. Liu died days later in a San Francisco hospital. Foucrault, the coroner, met with the three families Thursday to discuss his findings, the fire chief said. The mayor said firefighters and first responders helped save the lives of 304 of the 307 passengers and crew aboard the flight. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the crash landing, which also injured more than 180 people aboard the flight.

chatgpt: San Francisco was thrown into mourning as news filtered through that Ye Mengyuan, a 16-year-old girl from China, had been killed after a fire department vehicle struck her moments after Asiana Flight 214 crash-landed at the city's airport. Ye had been one of hundreds of passengers onboard the Korean passenger plane, which had flown from Seoul, South Korea. The incident occurred on July 6, 2013, as the plane made its final approach to San Francisco International Airport. According to reports, the aircraft's tail hit the seawall just before it landed, causing it to crash and catch fire. The impact was so severe that the plane's fuselage broke apart, and passengers had to escape through the emergency exits. Ye Mengyuan was among the last passengers to leave the plane, and she, along with her friend Wang Linjia, had been outside the aircraft when the fire department vehicle reportedly hit them. Linjia was also killed in the incident. It's unclear why the girls had gotten off the plane or whether they were trying to escape the fire. Following the tragedy, San Francisco's fire chief, Joanne Hayes-White, issued a statement expressing her regret and apologizing to Ye's family. "The San Francisco Fire Department extends our deepest condolences and sympathies to the family and friends of Ye Mengyuan during this difficult time," Hayes-White said. The city's Mayor, Edwin Lee, also expressed his "profound sadness" at the loss of the teenage girl. "This is a very difficult time for our city, and we extend our thoughts and prayers to the family and friends of Ye Mengyuan," Lee said. The incident sparked many questions over the policies and procedures in place at San Francisco's airport. Investigators launched an inquiry into the crash, and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) conducted an intensive investigation. The NTSB's findings revealed several factors that might have contributed to the tragedy, including pilot error, inadequate crew training and communication, and deficiencies in the aircraft's automated cockpit systems. The board also called for improved staff training, better emergency response planning, and stricter guidelines for locating and extinguishing fires. Asiana Airlines, the South Korean company that owned the aircraft, also faced criticism over its handling of the disaster. The airline was later fined $500,000 for failing to provide adequate information to the passengers' families and for responding too slowly to their needs. The deaths of Ye Mengyuan and Wang Linjia shocked many people across the world, who mourned the loss of the two promising young girls. Ye's family, in particular, was devastated by the tragic event, and they later filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the City of San Francisco. While nothing could ever replace the loss of Ye Mengyuan and Wang Linjia, the tragedy at San Francisco International Airport served as a reminder of the importance of robust safety protocols and effective emergency planning. Authorities continue to work tirelessly to ensure that tragedies like this don't happen again.
