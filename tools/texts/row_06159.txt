article: A school is having food delivered by taxi to comply with Nick Clegg's free meals policy. Under the £1billion Coalition scheme introduced last month, all pupils aged four to seven must be given lunch. Lacking adequate facilities, Sheepscombe Primary is paying a driver to bring in cold meals such as bagels from a nearby secondary. Sara Bennion, headmistress of the 33-pupil school near Stroud in Gloucestershire, said: 'We have tried lots and lots of ways to provide the hot meals. It has become quite problematic because obviously we want to be working towards hot food.' Pieter-Jon Alliss from Country Cabs pictured delivering the school meals to Sheepscombe Primary . Sheepscombe Primary (pictured), in Gloucestershire, is struggling to adhere to the free school meals policy . She said the meals policy was proving a strain on the school's finances. The Government provides £2.30 per child for a daily hot meal but Sheepscombe must pay £2.95 for the cold meal option – not including the £15 a day taxi charge. The school is making up the deficit with cash from the Small Schools Transitional Funding pot. Other schools have been reported ordering takeaway pizzas, giving pupils fruit and biscuits until late food arrives, shipping sandwiches in from pubs and seating children in classrooms and music rooms. Miss Bennion said: 'It is a great initiative but the kinks haven't been ironed out. We're hoping that negotiations with the local authority can help us find a solution.' The Liberal Democrat policy means 1.9million children can now access a free meal in reception, year one and year two. David Laws, who is the party's schools minister, has already declared the scheme a 'massive success'. Deputy Prime Minister Mr Clegg says giving children hot lunches can be better for their learning than extra English and maths lessons.

But critics dispute these benefits and say many schools are struggling to cope. In August, the Local Government Association revealed that councils are being forced to raid other funds because they have been left more than £25million out of pocket. Last month, it emerged that children aged four were served just one chicken nugget each at a school in Birmingham. They were rationed according to their age. The city council said it was investigating the incident at the unnamed school. The Government expects pupils to be routinely offered a hot meal option. Schools not in a position to do this straight away should be working towards it 'as soon as possible'. Mr Laws yesterday denied the policy had been implemented too quickly.

chatgpt: Sheepscombe Primary School, located in rural Gloucestershire, has been forced to pay a driver to bring in cold meals for its students in order to comply with the government's free school meal policy. According to the headmistress Sarah Bennion, this policy is straining the school's finances and is proving to be a tough challenge for them. The school has been paying for a cold meal option and an additional £15 for delivery. The decision to pay for a driver came after struggling to find a willing catering company to deliver fresh meals to the school every day. The headmistress stated that this policy has placed an extra burden on their tight budget, which has made it hard for them to manage other expenses. "It puts an extra strain on our finances, which means we have less money to invest in school equipment and resources," she said. Critics have also voiced their concerns about the practicality and feasibility of this policy. Many schools in rural areas are finding it hard to get catering companies to deliver fresh meals daily. As a result, schools are now resorting to buying premade cold meals, which are not as healthy or nutritious as a fresh hot meal. Moreover, the policy only covers one meal per day, meaning children are left to fend for themselves after school hours. This has resulted in many children returning home to empty cupboards or resorting to unhealthy snacks and alternative meals. The Liberal Democrats implemented the free school meal policy in 2014, and it has been a contentious issue ever since. Although the policy aims to provide children with healthier meal options, it has placed a heavy financial burden on many schools, some of which are already struggling to make ends meet. In conclusion, Sheepscombe Primary School's decision to pay a driver to deliver cold meals to students highlights the many challenges rural schools face to comply with the government's free school meal policy. While the policy may have had good intentions, it has placed additional financial burdens on schools, many of which are already struggling with tight budgets.
