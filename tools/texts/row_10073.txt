So far 10 lambs have been born and are being happily watched over by their South American guardians. Ms Spiller, a countryside service administrator, said: 'Foxes are a real danger to young lambs, snatching them away to eat. 'So when lambing was due we borrowed our friend's four alpacas to act as guards while the lambs are young. 'It's part of alpaca's herd instinct to protect youngsters.

'They instinctively chase off dogs and foxes and it has meant we have had one less thing to worry about.' She added the alpacas had been known to chase and trample foxes to death. Ms Hopkins, a Waitrose cheese and deli specialist, said the alpacas were perfect shepherds, protecting the young lambs as if part of their flock. She said: 'One of the alpacas called Cloud even pushed his nose under one lamb to help it stand up.' The herd will be returned to their owner Nikki Girdler, a teaching assistant, when the lambs are big enough to fend for themselves.

chatgpt: In a field in the heart of the Berkshire countryside, an unusual sight can be seen. Ten fluffy white lambs are playing and grazing while being watched over by a group of South American guardians, known as alpacas. The alpacas, standing at only 5ft tall, might not look like fierce protectors, but they are part of a herd instinct to lookout for younger animals and scare off potential predators. The owner of the farm, John Wilson, decided to introduce the alpacas to his herd of lambs after hearing about their exceptional guarding skills. He purchased the alpacas from a specialist farm that supplies them to farmers as an alternative to using guard dogs, which can sometimes be too aggressive and harm the animals they are meant to protect. Mr. Wilson explained that the alpacas have integrated well with the lambs, and the results have been superb. The alpacas have not only successfully deterred predators, but also offer a calm and peaceful presence that is soothing to lambs. On a sunny spring day, one could see the lambs and alpacas peacefully sharing their fields. The lambs frolic and playfully jump over their guardians while the alpacas roam their territory, keeping guard. Mr. Wilson hopes that his unique farming approach will inspire other breeders to adopt it, as it is an all-natural way to safeguard livestock without resorting to harmful or stressful methods. The use of alpacas for guarding is not a novel idea; in fact, it has been commonplace in South American countries for centuries. Alpacas are often used to protect smaller farm animals such as chickens or miniature pigs, as they are gentle, calm-natured, and good with children. This alternative farming method could revolutionize the way in which we protect our livestock in the future. It is cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and promotes a harmonious relationship between drastically different animals. In conclusion, the alpacas' presence on the farm in Berkshire has not just provided effective protection for the lambs, but has also introduced a unique and beautiful sight into the English countryside.
