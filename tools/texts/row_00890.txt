article: New York (CNN) -- A Wisconsin woman who said she agreed to cook and clean for a man she met on the internet in exchange for a free place to stay allegedly ended up as his sex slave, prosecutors said Wednesday. The 27-year-old woman met New York resident John Hopkins on the website Craigslist before spending nine days trapped in his apartment, where she claims she was repeatedly raped, according to a district attorney's statement. The woman -- whose name has not been released -- was treated for injuries at Woodhull Hospital in Brooklyn, New York. The details of her condition are not clear. Authorities charged Hopkins with rape, assault, forcible touching and unlawful imprisonment, arresting him at his Brooklyn apartment on Saturday. He is currently being held on $350,000 bail. The woman claims that she was looking for work in New York and found an advertisement that Hopkins posted on Craigslist, listing a room for rent, according to the complaint. The pair agreed that the woman could stay rent free if she cooked and cleaned for Hopkins, who then paid for her airfare to New York on February 4, 2011. Upon arriving at his apartment, Hopkins allegedly told the woman that she was going to be his slave, the complaint said. The woman claims she was repeatedly raped between February 4 and February 12, and was also tied with a rope, gagged and handcuffed to a radiator, it said. On the ninth day, she said she managed to call her mother and alert her of the alleged abuse. Police found the woman bruised and bound in Hopkins' apartment, according to the district attorney statement. Authorities said the victim was shaking and had marks on her body, according to the complaint. Hopkins is expected to appear in court Friday for a preliminary hearing. If convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison.

chatgpt: A woman who responded to a Craigslist ad seeking a live-in housekeeper in Long Beach, California, says she ended up being held captive and repeatedly raped. According to authorities, the woman agreed to work for John Hopkins, who promised her free rent in exchange for cleaning and cooking. However, as soon as she arrived at the apartment, Hopkins allegedly took her phone and ID, refusing to let her leave. The victim says she was forced to have sex with Hopkins multiple times a day over the course of a week. Hopkins reportedly threatened to kill her if she tried to escape or tell anyone. During the ordeal, she was not allowed to eat or drink without Hopkins' permission, and was forced to use a litter box as a bathroom. Hopkins was eventually arrested and is currently being held on $350,000 bail. He has been charged with multiple counts of rape, kidnapping, and false imprisonment. If convicted, he could face life in prison. According to the police, the victim was able to escape when Hopkins left the apartment to get groceries. She used his computer to contact her sister, who called the police. When officers arrived, they found Hopkins in the apartment with the victim's phone and ID.  The victim was taken to a hospital for treatment and is reportedly physically and emotionally traumatized by the experience. Authorities are urging people to be cautious when responding to Craigslist ads, and to thoroughly research prospective employers before accepting a job offer. This case highlights the dangers of online classified ads, and serves as a reminder that people must take precautions when meeting strangers. It is important to be aware of the risks associated with meeting someone online, especially when agreeing to work in a private residence. Anyone who feels threatened or unsafe should contact the police immediately.
