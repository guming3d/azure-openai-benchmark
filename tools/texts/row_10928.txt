article: TAIPEI, Taiwan (CNN) -- A Taiwan court early Tuesday ordered ex-President Chen Shui-bian, who is facing corruption charges, back to jail after deeming him a flight risk. Former Taiwan president Chen Shui-bian speaks to reporters on December 12 in Taipei. Chen had been free on bail, but prosecutors sought his return to state custody. After 12 hours of deliberation, a panel of three district court judges approved the request at 3 a.m. Taiwan time. Chen was immediately taken to jail. The island's first former president to ever face prosecution, Chen was freed earlier in December after spending a month in jail while prosecutors prepared his indictment on several corruption charges, including embezzlement and accepting bribes. Judges ordered Chen released after the indictment was formally presented, saying they did not believe he was a flight risk. However, Taiwan's high court was not satisfied with the decision and assigned a new judge to the case. Chen's attorney, Jen Wen Long, told reporters after the court order: "We question the work of the Taipei district court. Changing the judge is an interference with the justice system." Chen, whose term ended in May, is accused of embezzling about $18 million. A trial date has not been set in the case. Prosecutors allege he also took bribes, laundered money and illegally removed classified documents from the president's office. Chen, 58, has denied any wrongdoing and insists the charges are politically motivated. His party favors independence for Taiwan, while the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou favors closer ties with mainland China -- from which the island split amid civil war in 1949. If convicted, Chen faces 25 years or more in prison, although prosecutors did not seek any specific jail time in their indictment. Thirteen others, including Chen's wife, son, daughter-in-law and brother-in-law, also were indicted. Prosecutors have alleged that Chen's son has a Swiss bank account containing $22 million in what they believe is illegal proceeds. Journalist Andrew Lee contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Former President of Taiwan, Chen Shui-bian, who had been free on bail pending his trial on corruption charges, was ordered back to jail by a high court in Taipei. Chen's release in early December had been met with much controversy, with critics citing that the former president posed a flight risk and may tamper with witnesses if he was free while awaiting trial. The high court's decision came as a surprise to Chen's supporters who had been hopeful that he would remain free until his trial date is set. Chen is facing accusations of embezzling about $18 million during his two-term presidency, which ended in May. The former president had been free on bail since January, after spending eight years in prison on previous corruption charges. Chen's supporters had argued that he was in poor health and needed medical attention, but prosecutors believed that he may not appear in court if he was free, and that he may communicate with potential witnesses to influence their testimonies. Chen's lawyers had applied for bail last December, citing that he was not a flight risk and that he would not interfere with the ongoing investigation. The court freed Chen on bail, setting a $7.8 million bond, but the high court overturned the decision, mandating that Chen be returned to jail until his trial. Chen's latest imprisonment has sparked protests by his supporters, who believe that he is being unfairly targeted by the government. Chen is a controversial figure in Taiwan, with supporters hailing him as a champion of democracy, while his critics claim that he abused his position for personal gain. Chen's trial date has not been set, and it is not clear when he will appear in court again. The case against Chen is one of the biggest corruption scandals in Taiwan's history, and it has raised questions about the country's commitment to transparency and accountability. In conclusion, the decision to return Chen Shui-bian to jail pending trial on corruption charges has sent shock waves through Taiwan's political establishment. The former president is a divisive figure, with supporters and critics alike watching his case closely. Whether or not justice will be served in this complex case remains to be seen.
