article: Cairo (CNN) -- A pipeline that supplies gas from Egypt to Israel exploded Monday in the northern Sinai Peninsula near Bir el-Adb, an Egyptian security official said. The explosion appears to be an act of sabotage, said Gen. Saleh al-Masri, the head of security in Egypt's northern Sinai Peninsula. "It is an act of sabotage, but the army and members of Egyptian Natural Gas Company are on the scene trying to understand what happened," al-Masri said. The explosion has shut off the flow of gas to Israel and Jordan, said Ayman Jahin, a general manager at the gas company. It is the third such attack on Egyptian pipeline infrastructure since the toppling of Hosni Mubarak's government earlier in the year. The first two attacks resulted in a halt in the flow of gas to Israel, which receives about 40% of its natural gas from Egypt. The army cordoned off the area around the explosion, asking onlookers to return home," Mohamed Sabry, a freelance journalist at the scene, told CNN. He said flames could be seen shooting into the sky hours after the explosion. Firefighters were working to contain the fire, he said. Delivery of Egyptian gas to Israel came to a halt after an April attack on a pipeline in the Sinai Peninsula. The flow of gas through the pipeline to Israel was restored in early June. In February, a gas pipeline in El Arish that sent natural gas to Jordan was set on fire, shutting off the flow of gas to not only Israel but but Syria, Jordan and Lebanon as well. The issue of gas sales to Israel has become highly controversial in Egypt with various allegations circulating that Israel received below market prices for the gas and that Egyptian government officials enriched themselves on the deal. The Israeli government and Israeli investors in the pipeline have categorically denied below market pricing for the gas and last month one of the major investors released a statement expressing public frustration that the Egyptian government was not moving more quickly to get the gas flowing again and threatened to pursue legal action. The pipeline between Egypt and Israel became operational in 2008 and the arrangement represents one of the major economic agreements between the two countries. CNN's Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.

chatgpt: The flow of gas to Israel and Jordan from Egypt has been shut off again following an attack at the gas pipeline in Sinai yesterday. In light of the attack, the army has cordoned off the area and asked onlookers to leave. This is the third such attack since former President Mubarak's government was toppled, and the incident highlights the fragile state of affairs between Egypt and Israel, which have already been tense since the ousting of Mubarak. Israel receives approximately 40% of its natural gas from Egypt, which is a significant amount of its energy needs. Jordan also imports gas from Egypt, and its supply has also been cut off. Tensions in the region have been running high since the Arab Spring, and this attack on the gas pipeline underscores the security challenges that exist in Sinai. The Egyptian government has been struggling to maintain control over the vast and sparsely populated region, which has become a hotbed for militants and criminal gangs. Egypt has been working to diversify its energy sources and reduce its reliance on natural gas exports, but this attack could further complicate the country's efforts. The government has already ramped up security measures in and around the pipeline network, but it appears that these measures have not been enough to prevent attacks. The incident has also raised concerns in Israel, which has been closely watching developments in Sinai. Israeli officials have expressed their concerns over the increasing instability in Egypt, and the impact it could have on their own national security. The attack on the gas pipeline comes at a time when Egypt is facing a host of other challenges, including a struggling economy, high unemployment, and political instability. The government is embroiled in a fight against Islamic insurgency groups in Sinai, and it is also trying to tackle corruption and reform the economy. For now, the immediate concern will be restoring the supply of gas to Israel and Jordan, and ensuring that the pipeline network is secure. However, the underlying issue of insecurity in Sinai and the wider region will continue to be a major challenge for the Egyptian government, and for the wider Middle East.
