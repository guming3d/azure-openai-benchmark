Quick-fire: The infra-red finger will allow employers to test workers for alcohol in just eight seconds . Millions of workers could face a daily alcohol test using a fingerprint scanner before they start their jobs. The new device which uses near infra-red light to measure blood alcohol content in the skin will give employers a result in just eight seconds, making it possible to test 450 employees per hour. The AlcoSense TruTouch scanner will be ideal for companies to test if employees still have any alcohol in their system from the night before. Public sector staff in local government and the NHS and workers in the transport and security industries are likely to be the first to be targeted. But unions have slammed the tactic as draconian and said employers should be trying to help employees with drinking problems not catching them out. AlcoDigital, the company which distributes the device, says that daily alcohol testing is the 'only true way of eliminating on-duty alcohol impairment'. Drug and alcohol testing at work has . become a hot topic in recent years, with companies claiming heavy . drinkers cost them millions in loss of productivity every year. The new scanner raises the prospect of companies being able to test workers at any time of the day. AlcoDigital . told MailOnline the practice is already commonplace in many workplaces . in the U.S. with one of their clients including the Coca-Cola factory. But director Suzannah Robin said it is important for employees to be consulted before a regular testing system is brought in. Crackdown: The easy-to-use scanners could be used to target the 'liquid lunch' culture . She added: 'One of the things that companies say to us is that if they bring in random testing then individuals feel like they are being targeted. 'But this way it involves everyone from the managing director down. It's difficult to say anyone is being fingered or singled out. 'From our point of view it's important that any alcohol testing policy that is brought in has the full support of employees.' But Unison General secretary Dave Prentis condemned the move as using 'a sledgehammer to crack a nut'. He told Metro: 'If workers have a problem with alcohol, their employers should not be relying on a gadget to entrap them but should be providing them with proper support.' A statement on the AlcoDigital website reads: 'Random screening can deter the casual user, but those with a serious alcohol problem are far less likely to change their inherent behaviour patterns. 'For . this reason this form of occasional screening can fail to have the . impact the company is looking for and alcohol use can continue to cost . the company, and thousands of others, billions of dollars a year. 'Testing every person, every day changes the underlying behaviour itself.'

chatgpt: New technology is set to shake up workplace safety in the UK, with the introduction of the AlcoSense TruTouch device. The device, which promises to deliver accurate alcohol testing in just eight seconds, will be rolled out across a number of key industries, including public sector staff, transportation and security. Designed to combat the dangers of staff members still under the influence of alcohol from the night before, the TruTouch device represents a significant shift in the way in which employers monitor their employees' behavior. While traditional alcohol testing methods can take up to 20 minutes to deliver results, the TruTouch device is able to provide a pass or fail result in just a fraction of the time. The device works by measuring the alcohol content on the skin’s surface using Spectroscopy technology. When an employee places their hand on the device, the technology is able to deliver a reading within eight seconds, providing an instant assessment of whether the employee is fit to work. While the introduction of the device has been welcomed by many, including the Transport Security Administration in the US, it has not been without its criticisms. Some have accused employers of using a "sledgehammer to crack a nut", with the device seen as excessively draconian. In response, unions have spoken out against the use of the device, claiming that it will represent an infringement of their members’ rights. While the device will be used to test both public and private sector workers in the UK, unions have warned that the test should never become a “routine” part of any employment contract. Despite these reservations, many employers have confirmed their support for the introduction of the TruTouch device. Speaking to reporters, one industry representative highlighted the need for continued vigilance when it comes to workplace safety. With a growing number of high-profile accidents and fatalities occurring in recent years, the need to ensure that all employees are fully sober and alert has never been greater. As well as introducing the TruTouch device, many employers are also looking at alternative solutions to ensure that their workforce remains fully alert and ready to work. This has included the use of more traditional forms of alcohol testing, such as breathalyzers and blood tests. Despite the differing views on the TruTouch device, there is no doubt that it represents a significant development in the way in which employers maintain a safe and healthy workplace. As the need for greater awareness around alcohol and drug use in the workplace continues to grow, it is likely that more employers will look to implement similar devices and technologies in order to keep their employees safe and alert.
