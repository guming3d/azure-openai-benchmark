article: NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Eating a box of Girl Scout Cookies in one sitting will be a little bit easier this year: The Girl Scouts of the USA confirmed Wednesday that it has reduced the number of cookies per box to save money because of rising transportation and baking costs. People buying Girl Scout cookies like these on their Web site this year can expect fewer cookies in the packages. Michelle Tompkins, a national Girl Scout spokeswoman, said that "the cost of baking a cookie today is significantly higher than it was even a year ago, and our bakers cannot continue to absorb these rising costs." She also said transportation costs have increased 30 to 40 percent from a year ago. The combined cost increase prompted the organization to "lower the net weight of our cookie boxes slightly rather than ask our customers to pay a higher per-package price during these difficult times," Tompkins said in a written statement. There will be two to four fewer cookies in boxes of Thin Mints, Peanut Butter Sandwiches, Shortbread Cookies, DoSiDos and Trefoils, she said. The Girl Scouts also reduced the size of some cookies, but Thin Mint lovers shouldn't worry that their sweet snacks will get any slimmer: Only the Lemon Chalet Cremes will change shape. Tompkins said it is too early to tell how Girl Scout Cookie sales will fare for the year. She said the cookie-selling season ranges from October to May, with the bulk occurring between January and March. Each individual council determines when its scouts will sell, and many have just begun in the past few weeks. Tompkins said she's heard a range of comments on how sales are going: One council in Texas is having its best year ever, which attributes to new marketing, and other groups are reporting low numbers. Sales average $700 million a year, she said. "We hope Girl Scout Cookie lovers will understand the situation and continue to support our girls," she said. "As the premier leadership organization for girls, we also intend to use these circumstances as a business learning experience for the girls."

chatgpt: In an effort to save money on production costs, the Girl Scouts announced that they will be reducing the number of cookies per box. The organization declared that their bakers can no longer absorb the rising costs associated with cookie production. Starting this year, customers can expect to receive two to four fewer cookies in boxes of Thin Mints, Shortbread, and other cookie varieties. The organization assured customers that the price per box will remain the same, and the overall quality and taste of the cookies will not be impacted by the reduction in quantity. Furthermore, the Girl Scouts revealed that only one cookie variety will undergo a change in shape. The Lemon Chalet Cremes cookies will now have a rectangular shape rather than the traditional round shape. The organization stated that this change was also made to reduce production costs without compromising the quality of the product. The Girl Scouts cookie program is a beloved tradition that not only satisfies the sweet tooth of customers but also provides financial support for troops around the country. The cookie sales generate funds used to finance various activities and projects, such as camping trips, volunteering, and community service events. The organization emphasized that the reduction in cookies per box is a necessary step to ensure the sustainability and success of the program. "We understand that change can be difficult, but we assure you that our commitment to empowering young girls and providing them with life skills and experiences through the cookie program remains unchanged," stated a representative from the Girl Scouts. Despite some customer concerns about the reduction in the number of cookies per box, the Girl Scouts community has remained supportive of the organization's decision. Many have expressed appreciation for the Girl Scouts' efforts to be fiscally responsible while maintaining the quality of their cookies. In conclusion, the Girl Scouts have made a tough but necessary decision to reduce the number of cookies per box to save on production costs without compromising the quality and taste of their beloved cookies. While this change may take some getting used to, customers can take comfort in knowing that their purchase still supports a good cause and empowers young girls around the country.
