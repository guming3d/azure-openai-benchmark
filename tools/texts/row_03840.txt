article: Ramallah, West Bank (CNN) -- Work began Tuesday to exhume the body of Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat amid an investigation of his 2004 death. The exhumation process, which started with the removal of the mausoleum's glass and its marble tombstone, could take up to two weeks due to the delicate work that needs to be done by hand, a Palestinian source said. The exhumation comes after French authorities opened a murder inquiry into his death this year after high levels of a radioactive substance were found on some of his personal belongings.

Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas subsequently approved the exhumation of Arafat's body from his mausoleum, which is in the Palestinian presidential compound in the West Bank city of Ramallah.

Arafat died at age 75 at a Paris military hospital after he suffered a brain hemorrhage and slipped into a coma. In the days before his death, Palestinian officials said that he had a blood disorder -- though they ruled out leukemia -- and digestive problems. Rumors of poisoning circulated at the time, but Palestinian officials denied them, and then-Palestinian Foreign Minister Nabil Sha'ath said he "totally" ruled them out.

Francois Bochud, director of the Institut de Radiophysique in Lausanne, Switzerland, said his researchers had tested Arafat's toothbrush, clothing and keffiyeh, the distinctive black-and-white headscarf he often wore. A body fluid stain contained 180 megabecquerels per liter of the radioactive isotope, while a typical sample would contain 5 megabecquerels per liter, Bochud said. A becquerel is a unit of measurement of radioactivity. The fabric of Arafat's clothing, without body fluid, contained less than 10 megabecquerels per liter, Bochud said. Suha Arafat told CNN she wanted her husband's body exhumed so investigators could be "100% sure" of the presence of polonium. CNN's Sara Sidner contributed to this report.

chatgpt: The exhumation of the body of Yasser Arafat, the founder and the first chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, has begun in Ramallah, Palestine. The process, which could take up to two weeks, was launched after Arafat's widow, Suha Arafat, lodged a formal complaint alleging that her husband was poisoned. This comes after French authorities opened a murder inquiry into Arafat's death in 2012, following reports that he may have been poisoned with the radioactive substance polonium-210. Despite the suspicions, no formal charges have been brought in the case so far. The exhumation process involves removing Arafat's body from its mausoleum in the West Bank city of Ramallah and taking samples for forensic examination. The procedure is being carried out by a team of Palestinian, Swiss, and Russian experts, who are using specialized equipment and protective gear to prevent any contamination. The Palestinian Authority has said it hopes that the investigation will finally solve the mystery surrounding Arafat's death. Arafat, who died at the age of 75, was widely regarded as the face of the Palestinian cause and was instrumental in the ongoing struggle for a Palestinian state. Suha Arafat has accused Israel of being behind her husband's death, pointing to the fact that Arafat was besieged by Israeli forces in his Ramallah compound for more than two years before he fell ill and died in a French military hospital. Israel has denied any involvement in Arafat's death. However, Arafat's death remains a subject of much speculation and controversy, and his body has been the subject of several investigations over the years. In 2013, a report by a team of Swiss forensic experts said it had found evidence of polonium-210 in Arafat's belongings, including his toothbrush and clothing. The findings of the current investigation are expected to be released in the coming months. If evidence of foul play is found, it could open the door to further legal action and bring closure to Arafat's family and followers. The exhumation of Yasser Arafat's body is a reminder of the ongoing conflict in the region and the unresolved issues surrounding Palestinian statehood. With tensions between Israel and Palestine escalating in recent months, the investigation could have broader implications for the peace process and the relations between the two sides.
