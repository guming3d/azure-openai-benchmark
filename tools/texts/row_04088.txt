article: As professional athletes go, Vince Wilfork is pretty recognizable.Â At 6-foot-2 and 325lbs, the New England Patriots star couldn't even go incognito if we wanted. But when the two-time Super Bowl champion sidled up to a fan wearing his jersey in the Bahamas, the unobservant Patriots supporter was clueless. A video shot by Wilfork's wife Bianca and posted to her Instagram shows the massive NFL star leaning on a railing next to the fan in the No. 75 jersey. Clueless: This fan in a No. 75 Vince Wilfork jersey didn't recognize his favorite player when he introduced himself in the Bahamas . Wilfork's wife Bianca posted the video to her Instagram account on Sunday - proving that even her 6-foot-2, 325lb husband could go undercover if he wanted . 'You a Patriots fan?' Vince Wilfork asks. The fan nods. Mrs Wilfork asks: 'You know whose jersey who have on?' 'Yeah, Vince.' Mrs Wilfork responds: 'His. You've got his jersey on,' pointing to her massive husband. Big man: Head coach Bill Belichick (left) and defensive coordinator Matt Patricia are dwarfed by the massive Wilfork in this photo moment after the Patriots won Super Bowl XLIX on February 1 . Finally, it dawns on the fan that he's in the presence of his favorite NFL player. Wilfork, a 33-year-old defensive tackle, has played in four Super Bowls with the Patriots and just collected his second ring after the New England victory in Super Bowl XLIX on February 1. This isn't the first time a fan has failed to recognize his favorite player when confronted with him in real life. In 2013, Jimmy Fallon sent New York Mets pitcher Matt Harvey out on the streets of his city to interview Mets fans. Many of them told the ace that Harvey was their favorite player - without any realization that he was the one holding the microphone.
