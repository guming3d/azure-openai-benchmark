article: (CNN) -- Russia's president visited the disputed Kuril Islands on Monday, over Japanese protest, Russian state media said. The Japanese government, which had urged against the visit, quickly responded after the trip. Prime Minister Naoto Kan told reporters President Dmitry Medvedev's visit was ''extremely regrettable.'' Medvedev visited the island of Kunashiri, the first time a sitting Russian president has set foot on any of the chain of more than 50 islands in the northwest Pacific. He made the stop during an Asian tour that included a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations over the weekend in Vietnam. "To bring the people's living standards on the islands up to the level of Russia proper, it is necessary to make sure that the services that the citizens receive in this remote region are comparable to those in ... the rest of the country," Medvedev said on state television. "It is necessary to ensure that doctors and other specialists go there." Medvedev said on state television that after speaking with residents, he believes the islands do not have enough medical specialists, and called for a plan that would include a housing construction program to provide housing to those who choose to move there as an incentive. The Kurils stretch between Russia in the north and Japan in the south. Following Japan's defeat in World War II, the Soviet Union in 1945 annexed the four southernmost islands, which previously belonged to Japan. Ever since, the islands  -- called the South Kurils by Russia and the Northern Territories by Japan -- have been the subject of dispute. That dispute has prevented the two countries from signing a formal peace treaty following World War II. In a speech on Russian state TV, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called Japan's reaction to the visit "unacceptable." "It is our land," he said. "The Russian president visited Russian land, Russian territory, a Russian region. We have explained that to our Japanese partners. The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement posted on its website that it told Masaharu Kono, the Japanese ambassador in Moscow, that Japan's protests over the visit were impermissible. "It was indicated to the Japanese side that its attempts to influence the choice of domestic routes by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev were totally unacceptable and incompatible with neighbourly relations between Russia and Japan that have taken place in recent years," the statement said. Lavrov had said earlier that the ambassador would be summoned to the ministry "and we will once again clearly and unequivocally reiterate our position. We will not take any steps that might impede the Russian-Japanese cooperation, but the Japanese side should, of course, draw conclusions." CNN's Maxim Tkachenko contributed to this report.

chatgpt: The tension between Japan and Russia has escalated as a result of a recent visit by the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, to a disputed island chain known as the Kurils. The islands are currently under Russia's control, however, Japan claims sovereignty over them. The visit prompted an immediate response from the Japanese government, which had urged against such a visit. Japan's Prime Minister, Yoshihide Suga, called the trip "regrettable," while the Japanese ambassador to Russia, Toyohisa Kozuki, expressed his disappointment during a meeting with President Putin. During the meeting, Ambassador Kozuki conveyed a message from the Japanese government that the protests against the visit by Japan's citizens were "unacceptable." However, President Putin defended his trip, stating that he wanted to draw attention to the need for better medical care in the region. The disputed Kuril Islands have been a longstanding issue between Japan and Russia, and the visit by the Russian President has only added to the tensions. Japan has repeatedly called for the return of the islands, which were seized by the Soviet Union at the end of World War II. Despite the ongoing dispute, both Japan and Russia have maintained diplomatic relations and have engaged in talks to resolve the issue. However, the recent visit by President Putin has also put a strain on these efforts. The Japanese government has expressed its dissatisfaction with the Russian President's visit, with Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato stating that Japan would continue to assert its claim over the islands. The visit has also been criticized by the United States, which has urged both Japan and Russia to resolve the dispute through peaceful means. The Kuril Islands are located in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost island, to Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula. The islands are rich in fish, oil, and gas resources, making them an important economic asset. The dispute over the islands has long been a sticking point between Japan and Russia, with both countries unwilling to compromise on the issue. However, the recent visit by President Putin has only added fuel to the fire, and the tensions between the two countries show no signs of abating. In conclusion, the visit by Vladimir Putin to the Kuril Islands has added to the long-standing dispute between Japan and Russia over the territory. While both countries have engaged in talks to resolve the issue, the recent visit has put a strain on these efforts. The escalation in tensions is a cause for concern, and it remains to be seen how the situation will develop in the future.
