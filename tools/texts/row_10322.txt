article: (CNN)What is Africa's most competitive economy? Is it oil-rich Nigeria? No. Perhaps South Africa, the continent's mining powerhouse? Try again. Benefiting from a long history of political stability, a good governance record and an open and flexible regulatory system, Mauritius overtook South Africa last year to become the continent's most competitive economy. The tiny island country, located some 500 miles east of Madagascar in the middle of the Indian Ocean, is regularly hailed as one of Africa's success stories -- since it gained independence in 1968, Mauritius has had an excellent record of peaceful transition of power with free and fair elections taking place on a regular basis. Surrounded by stunning coral reefs, Mauritius spans less than 800 square miles and is home to over 1.3 million people -- mainly an ethnically and religiously diverse mix of people of Indian, African, French and Chinese heritage. The country, dotted with green sugar cane fields, sparkling lagoons and jagged volcanic mountains, is well known for its perfect palm-fringed beaches and cobalt blue seas, attracting nearly a million tourists annually. Despite the global slowdown in recent years, the Mauritian economy has consistently achieved annual growth rates of more than 3%, with estimations showing a rise to 3.5% in 2014 and 4.1% in 2015. The country enjoys the best business environment in Africa, according to the World Bank, which ranks it first in the continent for ease of doing business. Over 50% of the island country's land is arable, with sugarcane occupying about 90% of its total cultivation land. In fact, sugarcane is the country's major export crop -- in 2013, Mauritius produced an estimated 407,000 tonnes. Yet, despite sugar being a major export for decades, Mauritius has managed to successfully diversify its economy, mainly by investing in the manufacturing sector. Initially, the focus was placed on the production of textiles and clothing, but lately the country has begun setting its sights on exporting jewelry and watch components. Jewelry, watch and diamond production currently make up 10% of the Mauritian foreign exports, adding more than $150 million to the country's GDP. Overall, the manufacturing sector expanded by 3.0% in 2013, up from 2.2% the year before. Besides agriculture and manufacturing, other areas of rising economic activity include tourism and finance, especially banking and business outsourcing. The infamous flightless Dodo bird was a native here but unfortunately became extinct in the 1600s. Some 600 indigenous vegetation species grow on the volcanic island, which is also home to a wide variety of rare birds and insects. QUICK FACTS . Official name: Republic of Mauritius .

chatgpt: Mauritius, a tiny island country situated in the Indian Ocean, has been named as Africa's most competitive economy. The country has relied on its sugar exports for decades, but in recent years it has diversified its economy and has made significant progress in other sectors as well.  According to data from the World Economic Forum's (WEF) Global Competitiveness Index 2019, Mauritius ranked first in Africa and 52nd globally. The index measures a country's economic competitiveness based on various factors such as institutions, infrastructure, macroeconomic stability, health, education, and technology. Mauritius, with a population of over 1.3 million people, has been successful in creating a diversified economy that includes tourism, financial services, and manufacturing, among others. The country's strategic location and business-friendly policies have also been key factors in attracting foreign investments. The country's tourism industry has seen significant growth over the years, attracting millions of visitors to its beautiful beaches, crystal-clear waters, and diverse culture. The government has been proactive in developing infrastructure and promoting investment in the tourism sector, resulting in a surge of hotel and resort developments. Furthermore, Mauritius has been positioning itself as a hub for financial services, providing a gateway to African and Asian markets. The country's financial ecosystem provides a favorable regulatory and legal framework, as well as a skilled workforce in the financial sector. As a result, global businesses and investors have been flocking to Mauritius to take advantage of its favorable environment. The manufacturing sector in Mauritius has also made significant strides in recent years. The country has attracted multinational companies in the textile and apparel industry, as well as the electronic and IT sector. The government has implemented policies to encourage such investments, resulting in increased export earnings and job creation. Despite its success, the country still faces challenges in sustaining its economic growth. One of the major challenges is reducing its dependence on sugar exports, which account for a significant portion of its exports. The government has been investing in research and innovation to find alternatives and diversify its export base. In conclusion, Mauritius has emerged as a model for economic diversification in Africa. Its proactive and business-friendly policies have attracted foreign investors and propelled its economy to the top of the competitiveness index. Moreover, its success has provided a roadmap for other African countries looking to diversify their economies and reduce their dependence on traditional sectors.
