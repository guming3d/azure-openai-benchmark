article: (CNN) -- Using high-tech robotic cameras, a team of scientists is getting a rare first glimpse of marine life in the North Atlantic that could shed light on the ocean's ecosystem and climate to as far back as 1,000 years. Images of tulip-shaped sponges, brightly colored corals, delicate pink stars and feathery organisms were among the breathtaking marine life beamed up by a submersible robot that scoured the ocean bed at a depth of some 9,800 feet [3,000 meters] off the Atlantic coast of Newfoundland. The team, led by Fisheries and Oceans, Canada and including scientists from three Canadian universities and the Spanish Institute of Oceanography, is in the midst of a 20-day expedition to study 11 areas under the protection of the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization. Exploring these areas is important because they contain the "trees of the ocean," said Ellen Kenchington, research scientist with the Fisheries Department of Canada. She is among the lead scientists in the expedition. "It's been really spectacular," she told CNN affiliate CTV from her office at the institute as pictures from the robot streamed on her computer. "It's really changing our perception of the diversity that's out there. ... We're seeing new species in deeper waters." Kenchington told the Montreal Gazette that scientists potentially can look at the coral's chemical composition and determine the temperature of the water and other data from 1,000 years ago. "That's how we are able to say if there is warming or a change in climate direction," she said. "In order to understand the present, we need to put it into context." Corals have been a highly successful life form for 250 million years. They are tiny animals and polyps that exist as genetically identical individuals and can eat, defend themselves and kill plankton for food. In the process they also secrete calcium carbonate, which becomes the basis for an external skeleton on which they sit. These calcified deposits can grow to enormous sizes over a long period of time and form coral reefs. The reefs are among the world's most productive ecosystems and can harbor more than 4,000 species of fish and many other marine life forms. Some estimates have suggested 20 percent of the world's coral reefs are already dead and an additional 24 percent are gravely threatened. In the week they have left in the expedition, Kenchington and her team hope to collect samples and video from the depths of the ocean to gain a new understanding of these corals as well as other marine life. The underwater robot, operated by crew aboard the Canadian Coast Guard ship Hudson, is enabling the crew to go about 500 meters deeper than they have before. Kenchington told CTV the research will also help them evaluate areas that are still too deep for current fishing technologies but could be accessible in years to come. "This will enable us to give advice in the future about what types of organisms are in these areas before they're fished," she said.

chatgpt: In a groundbreaking discovery, scientists have uncovered deep-sea marine life that could shed new light on the ocean's climate. The research, conducted by a team of Canadian researchers, involved using robotic cameras to explore the ocean bed at an incredible depth of 9,800 feet. The discovery of these previously unknown species marks a significant milestone in our understanding of the ocean's ecology and geography. The study focused on the protected areas off the Canadian coast, where the researchers discovered a diverse range of deep-sea marine life. These included corals, sponges, and other species that play an important role in the ocean's ecosystem. The researchers have already begun analyzing the data and images collected during the study in order to better understand the biology and behavior of these creatures. However, the discovery of new marine life is just the beginning of the research's impact. The team hopes that the study will also help to evaluate whether these protected areas should be further conserved. Currently, only a small portion of the ocean is designated as protected, and many species are still at risk of extinction. The discovery of these new species and the potential for even more undiscovered life in the depths of the ocean underscores the urgent need for stronger conservation efforts. One of the most significant findings of the research is its potential to shed light on the ocean's climate. The ocean plays an essential role in regulating the earth's climate, and any changes to it can have far-reaching consequences. The scientists hope that by studying the marine life in these deep-sea areas, they can gain a better understanding of how the ocean's climate system operates. The study is also significant in its use of cutting-edge technology. The robotic cameras used to explore the ocean bed allowed the researchers to capture high-quality images and data of the marine life in its natural habitat. The technology also allowed the team to explore previously inaccessible areas, providing a more complete picture of the ecology of the ocean's depths. The study has already generated interest among marine biologists and conservationists around the world. The discovery of new life and the potential for improved conservation efforts is a major breakthrough in ocean research. The team's use of new technology is also an exciting development, showing that there is still much to learn about the ocean's depths. In conclusion, the discovery of deep-sea marine life off the Canadian coast is a significant development in our understanding of the ocean's biology, ecology, and climate. The study's potential to improve conservation efforts and expand our knowledge of the ocean's depths is truly exciting. With continued research and investment in technology, we can hope to uncover even more of the ocean's mysteries and protect this vital ecosystem for future generations.
