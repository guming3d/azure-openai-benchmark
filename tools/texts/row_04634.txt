Street-wise city birds are keeping their nests warm and pest-free by lining them with cigarette butts, research has shown. The nicotine and other chemicals in discarded filters act as a natural pesticide that repels parasitic mites. At the same time, the cellulose butts provide useful nest insulation. Researchers discovered that birds, including house sparrows, are lining their nests with discarded cigarette butts . Wild birds are known to protect their nests from mite invasion by importing certain chemical-emitting plants. The new evidence suggests some birds species in the urban jungle have adapted the same behaviour to harness the repellent properties of tobacco. Scientists in Mexico City studied nests of house sparrows and house finches that each contained, on average, about 10 used cigarette butts. The number of stubbed-out cigarettes incorporated into the nests ranged from none to as many as 48. In both species, nests with larger numbers of butts were significantly less infested by mites. To test the parasite-repelling effect, the researchers attached cellulose fibres from smoked and non-smoked filters to thermal traps placed in nests. The battery-operated traps attract mites by generating heat. Fewer parasites were drawn to traps laced with nicotine-laden smoked butts. Dr Constantino Macias Garcia, from the National Autonomous University of Mexico, and his team wrote in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters: 'We provide evidence that urban birds incorporate cellulose from smoked cigarette butts into the nest and that this behaviour entails a reduction in the number of nest-dwelling ectoparasites. The team say the birds use the butts to provide warmth to chicks because of its insulating properties, and because nicotine works as an insecticide . 'It appears that this effect may be due to the fact that mites are repelled by nicotine, perhaps in conjunction with other substances, because thermal traps laced with cellulose from smoked butts attracted fewer ectoparasites than traps laced with non-smoked cellulose. 'This novel behaviour observed in urban birds fulfils one of the three conditions necessary to be regarded as self-medication: it is detrimental to parasites.' Nicotine is a natural defence chemical used by the tobacco plant to ward off plant-eating insects, the researchers pointed out. It had been used to protect crops from pests and also to control parasites in poultry. The scientists said it was possible the anti-mite nest protection was a happy coincidence. Birds might only be lining their nests with discarded butts because they provide good insulation. Further studies could reveal if this is the case by offering the birds a choice of smoked and non-smoked butts. Either would do for insulation, but only filters from smoked cigarettes can effectively repel mites. 'Birds could distinguish smoked and non-smoked butts from their scent, just as some birds that use the chemical compounds of plants as defence against parasites appear to rely on olfaction to collect those with effective chemicals,' the scientists wrote.

chatgpt: A new study conducted in Mexico City has found that cigarette butts are a common material used by certain bird species in the construction of their nests. The study, published in the journal Urban Ecosystems, found that the average bird nest contained 10 cigarette butts, which may be harmful to the birds and their offspring. The study was conducted by a team of researchers from the National Autonomous University of Mexico, who collected 22 nests from three different bird species â€“ the house sparrow, the great-tailed grackle, and the rock dove. The researchers found that all three species used cigarette butts in their nests, with the house sparrow using the most, averaging 14 butts per nest. The use of cigarette butts in bird nests is not a new phenomenon, but the researchers wanted to study the extent of this behaviour and its potential impact on the birds. Cigarette butts are an attractive nesting material for birds because they contain nicotine, which acts as a natural insecticide, and the fibres in the filters provide insulation. However, the nicotine in cigarette butts can also be harmful to birds. It is known to have a negative impact on their health, with high levels of exposure leading to reduced growth rates in chicks and increased mortality rates. The researchers noted that birds are not adapted to deal with the toxins found in cigarette butts and that the long-term effects of exposure are not yet fully understood. The study also found that bird nests containing cigarette butts were more likely to be infested with parasitic mites. The researchers suggest that this may be due to the presence of nicotine in the butts, which attracts the mites. Mites can have a negative impact on the health of the birds and their offspring, and so the use of cigarette butts in nesting material may be detrimental to the survival of bird populations in urban environments. The researchers believe that this study highlights the need for more research to be carried out on the impact of urbanisation on wildlife. As more and more people move into cities, habitats for wildlife are shrinking, and birds are adapting by using a wider range of materials for nesting. However, the use of cigarette butts in nests may be an unintended consequence of this adaptation, which could have negative consequences for bird populations. The researchers suggest that measures could be taken to reduce the amount of cigarette butt waste in urban environments. They note that cigarette butt litter is a significant problem in many cities and that proper disposal of cigarette waste could help to reduce the amount of butts available for birds to use in their nests. In conclusion, the study conducted in Mexico City provides insight into the behaviour of certain bird species in urban environments. The use of cigarette butts in nesting material may provide short-term benefits for birds, but it may also have negative consequences for their health and survival. The research underscores the importance of understanding the impact of human activities on wildlife and the need for targeted interventions to mitigate harmful effects.
