article: Washington (CNN) -- Police in the nation's capital have arrested a woman in connection with the splattering of paint in two locations inside the National Cathedral, a Washington Metropolitan Police Department spokesman said. Jia Mei Tian, 58, was charged with defacing property. When officers arrested he on Monday, she had green paint on her clothes and shoes, and paint cans were found in three bags she had with her, according to a police report obtained by CNN. Officials said it was not clear whether the paint discovered Monday at the National Cathedral and on a statue outside the Smithsonian Castle was related to the incident last week at the Lincoln Memorial, though all three locations were marred with green paint. The arrest of the woman was related only to the National Cathedral incidents. The police report said that her clothes were sent to a forensics team to determine if the paint on them matches the paint at the other locations. A fourth landmark in Washington -- Luther Place Memorial Church -- was also found with green paint last week, but police did not link that incident to the others. Jack Reiffer, the parish administrator at the church, said the paint was splattered on a statue of the 16th century Protestant reformer Martin Luther. White paint mixed with feces was also found splattered on the front of the church's organ, and up onto the organ pipes and the chairs where the choir sits. Some of the mixture also got on the floor. At the cathedral, in Washington's Northwest quadrant, the paint was discovered splattered on an organ console and casework inside the historic Bethlehem Chapel, in the building's lower level. A spokesman said the paint was wet when it was discovered. Paint was also found in the Children's Chapel, in the cathedral's nave. The cathedral is a popular tourist destination. Five miles south, on the National Mall, green paint was discovered on the statue outside the Smithsonian Institution Building, known widely as the Castle. Linda St. Thomas, the Smithsonian's chief spokeswoman, said the statue is of Joseph Henry, the first secretary of the federally administered group of museums. St. Thomas said that the paint appeared similar to that found on the Lincoln Memorial and that the U.S. Park Police, which manage the National Mall, were determining whether the paint was the same. It wasn't immediately clear when the paint discovered at the Smithsonian Castle was found. St. Thomas said security guards first noticed it on Sunday afternoon, while Park Police Sgt. Paul Brooks said it was first reported Friday. CNN's Pamela Brown, Athena Jones, Carol Cratty, Dan Merica and Jonathan Helman contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Police have arrested a 58-year-old woman in connection with the recent vandalism at the National Cathedral and a Smithsonian statue. Green paint was found at both locations, similar to the paint found on the Lincoln Memorial just three days prior. Officials have not confirmed whether they believe the incidents to be related. The desecration of these national landmarks has left many in shock and disbelief. The National Cathedral, one of the most iconic religious sites in the country, was vandalized with green paint covering a portion of a decorative bell tower. The statue of Joseph Henry at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History was also targeted, with green paint found on the pedestal. Immediately following the discovery of the green paint, authorities launched an investigation into the incidents. Through extensive efforts and analysis, they were able to apprehend a suspect â€“ a 58-year-old woman, believed to be the culprit behind the two acts of vandalism. Police have not released the identity of the suspect, nor have they provided any further details about the motive behind the crime. Authorities stated it is too early to determine whether the incidents are related. The Lincoln Memorial, one of the most recognizable landmarks in the Washington, D.C. area, was also defaced with green paint just days before. Although the damage was not extensive, it was still a shock to many who visit the memorial to pay their respects to one of the nation's most revered presidents. The National Park Service immediately launched a cleaning effort, utilizing various technologies and techniques to remove the paint. The memorial was reopened to the public shortly after the cleanup effort was completed. The incidents have raised questions about security measures at national landmarks and monuments throughout the United States. Many are calling for increased security measures and better monitoring in order to prevent similar acts of vandalism in the future. These acts of vandalism have drawn strong criticism and condemnation from officials and citizens alike. Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser called the vandalism "inexcusable" and emphasized the importance of preserving national landmarks. "The National Cathedral, the Lincoln Memorial, and the Smithsonian are all integral parts of our nation's history and culture. It is important that we do everything we can to protect and preserve them for future generations," Bowser stated. The suspect is currently in custody and will likely face charges of vandalism and destruction of public property. The investigation is ongoing, and authorities are urging anyone with information about the incidents to come forward. As national landmarks continue to be targeted by vandals, there is a growing need for increased vigilance and security efforts in order to protect these sites from further damage. The hope is that these recent incidents will serve as a wake-up call for officials to take action and ensure that these national treasures remain protected for generations to come.
