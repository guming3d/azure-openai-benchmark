The cry of 'it's a girl' is usually a happy surprise after the birth of a new addition. But as 11-week-old Skyla Ratcliffe, from Weymouth, Dorset represents the fifth generation of females in her family, her gender was no real shock. There are 83 years between Sheila Walbridge and her great-great-granddaughter. The family have lived within two miles of each other in Weymouth for their entire lives. Great-great-grandmother Sheila Walbridge says that she is the head of a family of 'strong women' The third generation started with great grandmother Linda Frampton, 62, and then grandmother Cinamon Ratcliffe, 44. Cinamon’s daughter Jade Ratcliffe, 25, marks the fourth generation and is mother to baby Skyla. The whole family live within just two miles of each other and have spent their whole lives in Weymouth. The new grandmother, who stays at home to look after her family, said: 'It’s really nice to have five generations of girls in the same family, my grandmother was really thrilled when Skyla was born. 'It’s quite nice having a young family because you can all look after one another and it’s lovely when we are all together. 'I don’t think people really grasp it when they find out that there are five generations, but we were all quite a similar age when we had our children, which is why. 'People have also said that I don’t look old enough to be a grandmother, but I prefer to say nanna because grandmother makes me feel like I’m in my 70s.' Sheila was married to Harold Walbridge, 82 who died seven years ago, and she had her two children before the age of 24. Linda also has two children and gave birth to Cinamon in 1968 when she was 17. Cinamon lives with partner Terry Ansell, 61, who runs a caravan sales business and her two children are from a previous relationship. Jade and her boyfriend Ben O’Brien, 25, a lifeguard at a holiday park, are also parents to four-year-old Alfie. Great-great grandmother Sheila, who is proud to be the matriarch of the female dominated family, said: 'It’s a family of strong women.'
