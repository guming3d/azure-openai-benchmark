article: The Islamic State terrorist known as Jihadi John has been tracked by drones flying over the Syrian city of Raqqa – but British Special Forces chiefs fear a ‘kill or capture’ mission there would end in bloody failure, sources disclosed last night. Reaper drones deployed high above the terrorists’ strongholds are also believed to have identified hostages wearing orange jumpsuits but top brass are thought to have currently ruled out a rescue operation because IS defences are too strong. Special Forces bosses have advised the Ministry of Defence that a sustained bombing campaign lasting several weeks would be preferable. Scroll down for video . Eyes in the sky: Reaper drones are flying over terrorist strongholds in Syria. Above, file image of Reaper drone . A source said: ‘The imagery from the drones and satellites is instructive but IS infrastructure in Raqqa would have to be targeted over a sustained period to make any sort of raid a realistic possibility. ‘On the basis of our current advice there is very little chance of the Prime Minister signing off a rescue bid. The prospect of success has got to be 100 per cent or thereabouts, and at the moment it is nowhere near that. And for now there are not many other options on the table. 'While sightings of Jihadi John are useful, as was establishing his identity, we are still a long way off getting a hit on him. Right now a raid would be suicidal.’ Drones expert Mike Gething, editor of Jane’s Electro-Optic Systems, confirmed that a Reaper could pick out hostages’ jumpsuits ‘providing it knew where to look and its line of sight was not obscured’. No mercy: Jihadi John with British hostage Alan Henning, whom he later beheaded . He added that if terrorists looked directly into the sky they could be identified. The US Air Force has more than 100 MQ-9 Reaper drones at its disposal, though how many have been sent to Syria is unknown. The drone has a maximum range of 5,300 miles and can fly for up to 32 hours at 207mph. Its image sensors are inside its nose cone and a ‘Gorgon Stare’ wide area surveillance system, used in missions over Afghanistan, can also be fitted.

chatgpt: According to reports coming in from the beleaguered Syrian city of Raqqa, drones have picked up the movements of the infamous terrorist, Jihadi John. The same unmanned aerial devices are also believed to have identified hostages wearing orange jumpsuits. The intelligence gathered by the drones presents top military brass with an opportunity to strike a powerful blow against ISIS. However, they have reportedly ruled out a rescue mission, citing the terrorist group's unparalleled defences. Jihadi John first made worldwide news in 2014 when he appeared in ISIS propaganda videos, beheading US and British hostages. His real name was later revealed as Mohammed Emwazi, and he was said to have died in a drone strike in 2015. However, skepticism surrounded the reports of Emwazi's death, and some believe he is still alive and operating in Syria. The possibility that Jihadi John and hostages have been tracked is causing concern among security experts who fear for the physical and emotional welfare of those who have been taken captive. It is well-known that ISIS captives are subjected to brutal treatment that includes torture, rape, and execution. Although some experts have expressed disappointment that a rescue operation is not being planned, many understand the constraints under which military authorities are operating. ISIS militants have taken every possible step to fortify their positions in Raqqa, and any attempt at a rescue operation is expected to be met with fierce and deadly resistance. The decision to forgo a rescue mission has understandably been met with criticism from some quarters. Several analysts argue that it is more important to try and save lives than it is to worry about the risks that such an operation may pose. However, others have pointed out that any failed rescue mission not only threatens the lives of those involved but can also embolden the enemy. Despite the disappointment that rescuers will not be moving in, the fact that the location of Jihadi John and hostages have been identified gives military strategists an opportunity to plan other operations to disrupt and destroy the terrorist group's activities. A recent push to eradicate ISIS from its stronghold in Syria and Iraq has seen many successes. However, the presence of hostages held by the Jihadi group, particularly those taken from Western nations, remains an ongoing challenge for intelligence and military services. The latest report suggests that drones can play a significant role in mapping out territories and identifying targets that can subsequently be destroyed by airstrikes. All eyes are now on military strategists to see what action, if any, they will take in response to the intelligence gathered. The world remains on high alert as we wait to see how this situation unfolds.
