Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop told The Courier Mail that more than one passport is being cancelled a week. 'I can confirm I have cancelled three passports in the past week, four this month, and seized one foreign passport this week for security reasons.' 'Since July 1, 2013, a total of 55 passports were cancelled. About 45 have been done by me.' These figures are set to rise when the Government introduces tough new terror laws in the next Parliamentary sittings. The planned legislations will make it easier for the Government to cancel passports and suspend foreign passports for those with dual citizenship.

This week, the first Australian troops have flown to the Middle East in preparation for strikes against the Islamic State. The group of Special Air Service soldiers flew in secret from the RAAF base in northwest Sydney, headed for an operating base in the United Arab Emirates. The soldiers will be based there until they are called upon by the United States to begin strikes against the Islamic insurgents. Prime Minister Tony Abbott has recently sent a clear warning to Australian citizens fighting with the Islamic State that if they are killed by fire from Australian fighter jets: . 'They knew the risks, they took their chances, they broke Australian law, they are doing something which is a very serious offence under Australian law. Mr Abbott added that Australian defectors were one of the motives for this weeks campaign. 'It was one of the principle reasons for committing to the anti-ISIL fight, that there are Australians there in significant numbers who wish to do us harm.'

chatgpt: In the wake of rising terror threats, the Australian government has taken a tough stance on passport cancellations. Over the past month, four Australian passports have been seized, indicating possible links to terror activities. In a bid to counter such threats, the government has cancelled 55 passports since July 2013. The latest move comes as the government prepares to launch new terror laws that will enable it to improve its ability to cancel passports.   The government has emphasized that passport cancellations are a vital security measure that helps to counter the risk of terror threats. The recent seizures indicate that there are individuals who are seeking to travel overseas to engage in terror activities. The government has expressed concern that such individuals pose a significant risk to Australia's safety.   The new terror laws, set to be launched later this year, will make it easier for the government to cancel passports of individuals suspected of terror links. The laws will give the government the power to cancel passports without seeking court orders, something that has been a significant challenge in the past.   The Australian government has already implemented measures to strengthen its counter-terrorism efforts, with the first squadron of Aussie troops flying to the Middle East recently to prepare for conflict. These measures come in the wake of heightened terror activity throughout the world, with Australia facing increased risk of attack by individuals radicalised by extremist ideologies.   While there have been criticisms of the government's measures, most Australians are supportive of the government's actions to keep its citizens safe from harm. The recent incidents of passport seizures indicate that there are individuals who are seeking to engage in terror activities overseas, underlining the need for the government to act swiftly to neutralize such threats.   The government has also emphasized the importance of community awareness in countering the threat of terrorism. Efforts are being made to encourage people to report suspicious activities to the authorities, and to engage in constructive dialogue to promote understanding and tolerance.   In conclusion, the Australian government's recent measures to improve its ability to cancel passports of individuals suspected of terror links demonstrate its unwavering commitment to safeguarding the nation's security. As the threat of global terrorism continues to rise, it is vital that the government takes all necessary steps to protect its citizens and neutralize any potential threats. The role of the community in this process cannot be understated, with increased awareness and vigilance being key to ensuring the safety and security of all Australians.
