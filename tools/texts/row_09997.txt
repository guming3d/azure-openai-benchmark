article: (CNN) -- Authorities in South Dakota and Nebraska on Friday suspended a search for a missing Nebraska family after a relative told authorities he spoke to his kin and said they are doing well. The Schade family of Creighton, Nebraska, is not missing, a relative says. Law officers still don't exactly know the location of Matthew Schade of Creighton, Nebraska; his wife Rowena, and their two children -- a daughter, 11, and a son, 8. But authorities think they might be in Nebraska because officials received a tip that a brush truck they suspect the couple stole from a volunteer fire department in South Dakota has been found abandoned in Antelope County, Nebraska. A brush truck is a type of small fire truck. The family was last seen on March 20 in Knox County, where Creighton is located. Knox Sheriff James Janecek said the family had gone missing after an officer went to their house on a domestic abuse complaint. Matthew Schade had been on probation for burglary and is wanted for violation of probation and failure to report a change of address, Antelope County Attorney Michael Long told CNN. Schade's father, Chet Schade, contacted the Knox sheriff's office on Thursday afternoon. He confirmed he had spoken with all four family members and said they were alive and well. The Knox County sheriff's office is urging the couple "to contact authorities immediately to resolve the situation." "They could only help themselves by giving us a call," Janecek said. Searchers had been searching for the family in South Dakota's Black Hills until it was determined the couple possibly made their way back to Nebraska. "The investigation clearly shows the Schade family is no longer in the Black Hills area," said the sheriff's office in Pennington County, South Dakota. Investigators think the Schades might have gone camping on U.S. Forest Service property in the Black Hills. Schade had visited the area in the past, and law officers found the family's Ford Taurus on Tuesday in Silver City, South Dakota. CNN's Kara Devlin and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Law enforcement officials are continuing their search for a family who went missing after a deputy checked on a domestic abuse complaint last week. The family's car was found abandoned in South Dakota on Tuesday, but authorities still do not know the whereabouts of the family. According to the father of the man in the family, he had spoken to all four members shortly before they disappeared. Law enforcement officials are asking for the public's help in locating the missing family. The search began after a deputy responded to a domestic abuse complaint at the family's residence on Friday. After finding no one home and no signs of a disturbance, the deputy left the residence. However, when the family failed to show up for work or school the following day, officials began to investigate their whereabouts. The discovery of their abandoned car in South Dakota on Tuesday only added to the mystery of their disappearance. Despite extensive efforts by law enforcement officials, including aerial searches and tracking dogs, no new leads have emerged. However, authorities say they will continue their efforts until the family is found. Meanwhile, the family's loved ones are hoping for a positive outcome. "We just want to know they're okay," said a relative of the family. The missing family includes a man, woman, and two children. Officials are asking anyone with information regarding their whereabouts to contact the local sheriff's department. As the search continues, this case serves as a reminder of the importance of being vigilant and reporting any suspicious activity. Law enforcement officials urge anyone who sees anything out of the ordinary to contact the authorities immediately.
