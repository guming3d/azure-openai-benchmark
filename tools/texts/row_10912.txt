article: By . Martin Robinson . Golden contract: Cathy Butterworth was given a deal worth £900,000 for just three years' work . A senior police civilian worker was handed a golden contract worth almost £900,000 for just three years' work, it was revealed today. Cathy Butterworth was head of training and development for Greater Manchester Police on a £87,000 salary. But she also received a bonus of up to £8,700 a year, a 'termination payment' of more than £200,000 and a £400,000 pension pot when she hits 55. An internal report has revealed her 'unique' package, with its author admitting the deal was 'particularly well drafted from the employee's perspective'. The report details the 'unique characteristics' of her contract, which handed Ms Butterworth 10 years' worth of extra contribution into her pension pot. It was drawn up by her boss Andrew Marston - who himself had just been granted early retirement and a massive pay-off - and signed by David Whatton, the then Deputy Chief Constable of GMP, who went on to become the top officer at Cheshire police. GMP had considered taking action against now-retired Whatton but the Independent Police Complaints Commission ruled he should face no action after hearing he had accepted professional advice. Ms Butterworth's overall remuneration package following her three years as director of learning and development - when her salary, her estimated £400,000 pension and 'termination' payments are added - amounted to £865,000. Report: A Greater Manchester Police report has revealed Ms Butterworth's deal was 'well-drafted' from an 'employees perspective' She left in 2011 after the force agreed a significant pay-off, even though GMP was embarking on a savage £134m cost-cutting exercise that would cost 1,500 jobs. Published accounts for the following year stated the 'termination payment' was £117,413 and GMP bosses insisted at the time it was a routine redundancy pay-off. But the real figure was £204,413 as an additional £87,000 payment was hidden in another section of the accounts, the report confirms. Ms Butterworth is now assistant head of people strategy at Oldham Council and has been warned 'not to count on' her GMP pension. She has declined to comment.

chatgpt: Cathy Butterworth, the former head of training at the Greater Manchester Police, has received a significant pay-off and pension pot after leaving her job with the force. According to internal documents, Butterworth earned a salary of £87,000 per year and was entitled to a pay-off of £200,000 when she left her role. She also had a pension pot worth £400,000. Butterworth worked for the force for three years before leaving in December 2020. Her contract, which has been reviewed internally, has been described as "well-drafted" from an employee's perspective. The review suggests that it was fair and reasonable in terms of the compensation Butterworth received. Despite this, the deal has come under scrutiny from some who believe that such large rewards for senior staff members are not appropriate, particularly given the financial pressures faced by public sector organisations in recent years. Some critics have also pointed out that Butterworth's tenure at GMP was marked by controversy, including reports of bullying and a high-profile security breach. Responding to these criticisms, a spokesperson for GMP said, "We recognise the concerns that have been raised regarding this payment and we take them seriously. However, we stand by the terms of the contract that was agreed with Ms Butterworth and believe that it was fair and appropriate." The payment to Butterworth comes at a time when many public sector organisations are under significant financial pressure, with cuts to funding and rising demand for services. There has been widespread concern that senior staff members in these organisations are often still awarded large salaries and bonuses, even as frontline services are cut and workers are laid off. The controversy surrounding Butterworth's payments is likely to continue, with many questioning the fairness and appropriateness of the deal. However, the internal review has lent some support to GMP's position, suggesting that the contract was reasonable and well-drafted. It is ultimately up to the public to decide whether or not they believe that such payments are justified for senior public sector employees.
