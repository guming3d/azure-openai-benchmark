An Indian low-cost airline is to only hire female flight attendants to save money on its fuel bill. GoAir says that carrying only female cabin crew could save 30million rupees (£330,000) a year because they are 33lb to 44lb lighter on average than their male counterparts.

Low-cost airline GoAir is to only hire female flight attendants to save money on its fuel bill . GoAir plans to add 80 aircraft to its 15-strong fleet by 2020, reports the Times of India, and will recruit 2,000 cabin crew and pilots. It will also cut the size of its in-flight magazine and only fill its water tanks to 60 per cent capacity to try to make its planes lighter. The company estimates that every extra pound in weight costs it one-and-a-half rupees (1.7p) per flying hour. Chief executive Giorgo De Roni blamed the Indian rupee, which has dropped 27 per cent against the US dollar in the last year, for the need to cut costs. 'The rupee's fall has hurt the industry badly,' he told the newspaper.

'We are looking at every possible way of cost-cutting to remain profitable.' De Roni said the new planes would have 'sharklets' - wingtip devices - to help reduce fuel burn by 5 per cent.

chatgpt: GoAir, a low-cost airline based in India, has announced that it will only hire female flight attendants in the future. The decision was made after the airline found that its female staff are typically 33lb to 44lb lighter than their male counterparts. The move could save the company up to 30 million rupees (£330,000) per year. GoAir's CEO, Vinay Dube, assured the public that the 132 male flight attendants currently employed by the airline will not be let go. The decision to only hire women in future is simply part of the company's cost-cutting measures. GoAir is reportedly aiming to reduce its fuel consumption by up to 2.5%, and having lighter staff on board could help to achieve this. The new policy has raised questions about gender discrimination in the workplace. However, GoAir maintains that the decision to only hire women is based simply on their physical characteristics, rather than their gender. In a statement, the airline said that "female cabin crew are always in great demand, and the attributes of being female include agility, flexibility and dynamism, which are attributes highly appreciated by our customers." Some experts have criticized the move, saying that it sends a message that female staff members are only valued for their appearance, rather than their skills or abilities. Others have pointed out that being lighter does not necessarily equate to being more agile or flexible. Regardless of the controversy surrounding the decision, GoAir has emphasized that it is necessary for the company's financial viability. The airline, which was founded in 2005, operates a fleet of 49 planes and serves 34 domestic and international destinations. It remains to be seen whether other airlines will follow GoAir's lead in hiring only female flight attendants. For now, the move is likely to spark further conversations about gender and weight discrimination in the workplace.
