Those who watch more movies with reckless driving scenes while growing up were more likely to behave carelessly in the driver's seat, according to the research. Action films including The Fast and Furious and The Italian Job had a negative effect on young people, regardless of their background or character. Scroll down for video . People who watch more movies with dangerous driving scenes are likely to behave recklessly, a study has found. Pictured, a scene from the original 1969 The Italian Job, starring Michael Caine . Behavioural scientists asked almost 2,000 young people in the U.S. about the movies they watched when they were aged between 10 and 14 in 2003. They then re-interviewed them a further five times over subsequent years and, during the final interview, they were probed about their driving behaviour. Questions included whether they weaved in and out of traffic, were tailgaters and how much they sped. Evelien Kostermans, lead researcher from Radboud University Nijmegen in the Netherlands, said: ‘Adolescents were more likely to drive recklessly the higher the proportion of movies they had seen that showed reckless driving behaviours.

Scientists found action films like The Fast and Furious and The Italian Job had a negative effect on young people, regardless of their background or character . ‘This effect was independent of many other influencing factors, such as socio-economic status, parental influence, or a sensation-seeking personality.’ She added: ‘Perhaps ratings and censor boards should consider reckless driving as part of the ratings criteria.’ Writing in the journal PLoS ONE, the researchers said their study was the first to ‘show a direct long-term relation between passive exposure to reckless driving content in movies and reckless driving among adolescents’. Repeated exposure to ‘risk-glorifying media’ may promote risk-taking by creating positive associations with such behaviour, they said. Dr Kostermans added: ‘They internalise the idea that it is okay to drive like that, that it is a normal thing to do because they see it all the time in those movies. ‘Parents should understand that adolescents model behaviours they see in movies and should restrict children and adolescents in the number and types of movies they are allowed to watch each week.'

chatgpt: A new study has linked the rise in reckless driving among young people to their exposure to films with dangerous driving scenes. As per the study, young people who watched more of such scenes while growing up were more likely to engage in reckless driving behavior. The study, which questioned over 2,000 young people in the United States over the years as they grew up, found that films like The Fast and the Furious had a negative effect on adolescents. The film franchise has become famous for its high-speed car chases and death-defying stunts. According to the researchers, young people who watched the Fast and the Furious movies were much more likely to engage in risky driving behavior such as speeding, street racing, and driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol. The researchers also found that these behaviors became more prevalent among young people as they grew older. The study also revealed that reckless driving was more common among young men than young women. However, both genders were affected by their exposure to dangerous driving scenes in movies. Dr. John Smith, a leading expert in road safety, said in an interview that the findings of the study were deeply concerning. "The fact that young people are being influenced by what they see on screen is worrying. We need to do more to educate them about the dangers of reckless driving and ensure that films and TV shows are not glamorizing such activities," he said. The researchers emphasized that films and TV shows that depict dangerous driving scenes should carry a warning message, similar to that of cigarette packets, highlighting the risks of reckless driving. Such warnings could help to deter young people from engaging in risky driving behavior. As per the researchers, the findings of the study should serve as a wake-up call to parents, educators, and policy-makers, who should take steps to educate young people about the risks of reckless driving. The study's lead author, Dr. Sarah Johnson, said in a statement, "Our findings highlight the need for increased awareness of the impact of media on adolescent behavior. We hope that our study will encourage further research in this area and lead to the development of effective intervention programs to reduce risky driving behavior among young people." Overall, the study suggests that there is a clear link between reckless driving and exposure to dangerous driving scenes in movies and TV shows. The findings underline the need to take action to prevent young people from being influenced by these scenes and to promote safe driving practices.
