article: (CNN) -- "I have rights. I have the right of education," Malala Yousufzai boldly asserted during an interview with CNN last year.

Her plight has inspired people far beyond her home in the Taliban-heavy Swat Valley. Large crowds are rallying around the world to show support for Yousufzai and her cause. Before the attack, Yousufzai was in the process of starting a charity, the Malala Education Development Organization, to promote female education in northern Pakistan.

chatgpt: Malala Yousufzai, a 14-year-old Pakistani girl, has become an international symbol of courage and advocacy for girls' education. The young activist was shot by the Taliban for speaking out about the right of girls to go to school. Yousufzai has remained dedicated to her cause, even after the harrowing attack. Many nonprofit organizations are working in Pakistan to help girls gain access to education. The Malala Fund, founded by Yousufzai and her father, works to empower girls and ensure they receive the education they deserve. Other organizations, such as Plan International, are also working to improve educational opportunities for girls in Pakistan. Despite the efforts of these organizations, girls' access to education remains limited in Pakistan. The country has one of the lowest literacy rates in the world, and girls' education is often undervalued. This is especially true in rural areas where poverty, traditional gender roles, and cultural norms make it difficult for girls to attend school. In response to the attack on Yousufzai, many people have shown their support for her and her cause. The "I Am Malala" petition, started by the United Nations Special Envoy for Global Education, Gordon Brown, has gathered over one million signatures. The petition calls on governments around the world to ensure that all children have access to education, and that they are safe while attending school. Another way people are showing their support is by submitting an iReport to CNN. The iReport is a platform where people can share their stories and pictures to show solidarity with Yousufzai and other activists fighting for girls' education. By sharing their stories, people are demonstrating that they stand with Yousufzai, and they will not be silenced by violence. In an interview with CNN, Yousufzai said that she wants to continue fighting for girls' education, even if it means putting her own life at risk. She believes that education is the key to a better future, not just for herself, but for all girls in Pakistan and around the world. In conclusion, Malala Yousufzai has become a powerful voice for girls' education in Pakistan and beyond, despite the threats and violence she has faced. By supporting organizations working to improve educational opportunities for girls, signing the "I Am Malala" petition, and submitting an iReport, people can show their support for Yousufzai and help ensure that all children have access to education.
