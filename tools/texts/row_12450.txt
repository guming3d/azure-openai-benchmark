A 31-year-old Mexican housewife has given birth to sextuplets - 12 years after she had quadruplets. Salud Romero extended the size of her family on Thursday with four girls and two boys born by Caesarean section. The babies, who weigh between 1.25 to 2lbs each, are in incubators and their condition is 'delicate'. Extending the family: Salud Romero (pictured) gave birth to sextuplets 12 years after she had quadruplets . They are said to measure just 12 inches long. Father Joshua Salinas, a 21-year-old labourer who earns between £60 and £95 a month, admitted they had not even got round to thinking about names for the babies. He said: 'I feel very happy but also worried about their health and how we’re going to cope financially. 'We thought Salud was going to give birth to five children so the sixth caught us by surprise. 'We haven’t even thought of names for them yet. I’ll talk with Salud about that when the children are out of danger.' Delicate condition: A nurse monitors one of the sextuplets born by Caesarean section who weighed between 1.25 to 2lbs each . Doctors decided to deliver the babies when Mrs Romero was just 27 weeks pregnant because of anaemia and an internal bleed. Rosalba Martinez, a neo-natal specialist at the Women’s Hospital in Morelia, 200 miles west of the capital Mexico City where the babies are under constant observation in intensive care, said: 'The outlook for them is not great but we have the staff and tools we need here to do the best we can.' Hospital director Yara Pineda added: 'Their health is delicate because they are underweight, because of their lack of pulmonary development and because of all the complications associated with artificial respiration.' Holds onto life: Another of the sextuplets who father Joshua Salinas is worried about, born at just 27 weeks . Mother-of-nine Mrs Romero gave birth to quadruplets 12 years ago. Two of the children, fathered by a previous partner, survived and she went on to have another child with her current partner. The world’s last set of sextuplets were born in October 2008 in the New York borough of Queens. They were delivered by Caesarean section during mother Digna Carpio’s 25th week of pregnancy. The Suleman octuplets, born in California in January 2009, are the longest-living octuplets in known history.

chatgpt: Salud Romero, a 31-year-old mother from San Diego, has given birth to twins just 27 weeks into her pregnancy. While the birth of a new baby is always a joyous occasion, these children were born prematurely and now require special care. The babies, who are being cared for in incubators at a local hospital, are said to be in "delicate" condition. This means that their health is more vulnerable than that of full-term babies and could require more medical attention. Premature birth is a serious issue that affects many families around the world. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 15 million babies are born prematurely each year, and an estimated 1 million of them die as a result. While the causes of premature birth are not always clear, many risk factors have been identified. These include maternal age, maternal health conditions such as hypertension or diabetes, infections during pregnancy, smoking, and drug or alcohol use. In the case of Salud Romero, it is not yet known what caused her to deliver her babies prematurely. However, she and her family are now doing everything they can to ensure that the twins receive the best possible care. The hospital where the babies are being treated is well-equipped to handle premature births. They have a team of experienced medical professionals who specialize in neonatal care and have access to the latest medical technology. The babies' care team is carefully monitoring their health and providing them with the necessary nutrition and support to help them grow stronger. However, premature babies are at risk for a variety of complications, including breathing problems, infections, and developmental delays. Salud Romero and her family are no doubt facing a difficult road ahead, but they can take comfort in knowing that their babies are in good hands. With time, patience, and plenty of love and support, these little ones may grow up to be healthy, happy, and thriving. In the meantime, Salud Romero is grateful for the outpouring of support she has received from friends, family, and the community. She is determined to stay strong and positive for her babies, and she is hopeful that they will make a full recovery. Premature birth is a serious issue, but with advances in medical technology and continued research, there is hope for better outcomes for premature babies in the future. We wish Salud Romero and her family all the best as they navigate the challenges ahead.
