article: (CNN) -- In days of yore, comedian Steve Martin said he used to try out jokes in clubs and adjust them based on an audience's feedback. "Today, the process is faster. It's your brain, a button, then millions of reactions," he said on his website. Martin was writing Monday to explain himself after sending a tweet that, by his own admission, was "unfortunate." "To those who were offended, again, I offer a deep, sincere, and humble apology without reservation," he wrote. "But I feel I need to tell you the context and origin of the joke." The storm started Friday when he invited people to ask him grammar questions on Twitter. Someone wrote, "Is this how you spell lasonia?" to which Martin replied: "It depends. Are you in an African-American neighborhood or at an Italian restaurant." "I knew of the name Lasonia. I did not make it up, nor do I find it funny. So to me the answer was either Lasonia (with a capital), or Lasagna, depending on what you meant. That they sounded alike in this rare and particular context struck me as funny. That was the joke," he wrote on his website. "When the tweet went out, I saw some negative comments and immediately deleted the tweet and apologized. I gathered the perception was that I was making fun of African American names." The story didn't stop there. Martin said his tweet was picked up and quoted, inaccurately, by various outlets, including Salon. "It depends. Are you in an African-American restaurant or at an Italian restaurant," Salon said Martin wrote, suggesting he meant to imply that African-American restaurants can't spell "lasagna." The inaccurate version spread, and Martin said he felt he "couldn't get out of hell." "Comedy is treacherous," he wrote. "But it's my job to know."

chatgpt: Comedian Sparks Controversy with Insensitive Tweet Renowned comedian, Jack Adams, has landed himself in hot water after posting a tweet that has been deemed racially insensitive by social media users. Adams, who is known for his comedic commentary on various social issues, took to Twitter to invite his followers to ask him questions. He was not prepared for the backlash that would ensue after he posted his response to a question from one of his followers. The tweet read: "It's your brain, a button, then millions of reactions." While it seemed like a harmless response, many people were quick to point out that the statement was insensitive towards African-Americans. Some accused Adams of perpetuating harmful stereotypes by implying that Black people are impulsive and have no control over their reactions. Adams has since issued an apology for his tweet, stating that he did not intend to offend anyone. He explained that he was trying to make a joke and did not realize that his words could be interpreted in such a negative way. "I am deeply sorry for any hurt that I may have caused," Adams wrote in his apology. "My intention was never to be offensive or hurtful." Despite his apology, many people on social media have called for Adams to face consequences for his actions. Some have called for him to lose his platform as a comedian, while others have urged him to use his platform to educate himself and his followers on issues of race and privilege. This is not the first time that Adams has faced controversy over his statements on social media. In the past, he has been criticized for making jokes about gender and sexuality that are considered offensive by some people. While he has apologized for these previous incidents, some people feel that his recent tweet was the final straw. As the conversation around racism and bias continues to grow, it is important for public figures like Adams to be mindful of the impact that their words can have on marginalized communities. The incident serves as a reminder of the need for more education and awareness around issues of race and privilege in our society.
