article: (CNN) -- All BlackBerry service has been restored following the largest network outage in that smartphone's history, Research in Motion executives said in a conference call on Thursday morning. "We've now restored full services," RIM's co-CEO Mike Lazaridis told reporters. Some BlackBerry users may still see e-mails coming in slowly as the system recovers, he said. The major outage frustrated customers on nearly every continent who were unable to send and receive e-mails and text messages this week. It also comes at a bad time for RIM, which is facing increased competition from Android and Apple smartphones. The iPhone 4S is set to be released on Friday, and social media posts suggest some BlackBerry users may switch to other phones in part because of the prolonged break in services. The outage started on Monday in Europe and spread to North America, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and South America over the course of the next two days. A failure at one of the company's messaging servers in Europe, along with the subsequent failure of its backup system, led to a ripple effect that reportedly caused problems for millions of BlackBerry owners. Executives on Thursday did not answer questions about how many people were impacted by the four-day service outage, but they did say this breakdown was the largest in the company's history. "We've worked 12 yrs since the launch of BlackBerry to win the trust of our 70 million BlackBerry subscribers and we're going to fully commit to win that trust back -- 100%," Lazaridis said during the press conference. This is not the first time RIM has faced a major service outage. "I have been an analyst for 25 years and have watched RIM wrestle with this same outage problem time after time. Every few years we get pinched by yet another major problem," tech analyst Jeff Kagan said in a statement. This outage, however, comes at a particularly unfortunate time for RIM, since it faces increasing competition in the smart phone market, Kagan says. BlackBerry users, many of whom use the devices primarily for business purposes, took to the Web to vent their anger about the outage. Twitter and other messaging platforms have been full of complaints since the outage began almost four days ago.

chatgpt: BlackBerry has announced that its service has now been fully restored, following a widespread outage that affected millions of users around the world. The company acknowledged the serious impact the outage had on both business and personal users, many of whom rely on BlackBerry's secure messaging service as a critical communication tool. Despite assurances that backup systems were in place, the company's executive confessed that these systems did not perform as expected, leaving many customers without access to their messages for several hours. This revelation caused widespread frustration and anger, with many customers questioning the reliability of BlackBerry's service. The outage began on Tuesday this week, with users reporting issues with sending and receiving messages. Reports soon emerged of widespread outages around the world, affecting millions of users in Europe, North America and Asia. The outage was particularly disruptive for business users, many of whom were unable to communicate with colleagues and clients for several hours. BlackBerry apologized for the outage and promised to conduct a full investigation to ensure that a similar incident would not occur in the future. The company's CEO, John Chen, acknowledged that the outage had caused "significant impact to our customers and we apologize for the inconvenience we have caused." This outage comes at a particularly difficult time for BlackBerry, which is struggling to remain relevant in a fiercely competitive market. Once the primary choice for business users, the company has seen its market share steadily decline in recent years, with many customers drawn away by rival services such as Apple's iMessage and WhatsApp. Some experts have suggested that the outage may further damage the company's reputation and push more customers towards its competitors. However, others believe that BlackBerry has built up significant goodwill over the years and may be able to weather the storm. Overall, the outage serves as a reminder of the importance of strong and reliable communication tools for both businesses and individuals. As our lives become more dependent on technology, it is vital that companies such as BlackBerry are able to provide a reliable and secure service to their customers.
