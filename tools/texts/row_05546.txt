article: New York (CNN) -- The fall that seriously injured an actor in the stage musical "Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark" was caused by human error, an actors' union said Wednesday. The "Spider-Man" company met Tuesday with officials from the union, the Actors Equity Association, and members of Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the New York State Department of Labor. The union said after consulting with OSHA and the labor agency, it concluded that the fall was caused by human error. The union did not give any details but said it worked with the other agencies to develop a safety plan to address the issue. Christopher Tierney, 31, is listed in serious condition, said Bellevue Hospital spokesman Steven Bohlen. Jonathan Dealwis, a tourist from New Zealand who was in the audience, said Tierney fell "about 6 meters," or about 20 feet, Monday night. Reeve Carney is the actor who plays Spider-Man, but nine people perform Spider-Man's stunts when the character is masked, according to show spokesman Jaron Caldwell. Dealwis said the accident happened near the end of the show. "Spider-Man was on a bridge, and Mary Jane was dangling from it," Dealwis said. "I think he was meant to sort of swoop over there, but he just fell off. ... The harness, you could see it just flick off his back and fly backward." Afterward, Dealwis said, "It just went black, and the producer came on and said we're going to pause for a moment. You could hear Mary Jane weeping." A producer then came out and said the show was over, Dealwis said. Dealwis said the performer was wheeled away in a neck brace and was alert when he was taken to Bellevue Hospital. Rick Miramontez, another show spokesman, issued a statement confirming the performer fell from a platform and the show was stopped. "All signs were good as he was taken to the hospital for observation," Miramontez said. Wednesday's matinee performance was postponed after the incident, Miramontez said, but all subsequent performances will proceed as scheduled. Show director Julie Taymor said the accident was "obviously heartbreaking for our entire team and, of course, to me personally." "I am so thankful that Chris is going to be all right and is in great spirits," Taymor said in a statement Tuesday. "Nothing is more important than the safety of our 'Spider-Man' family, and we'll continue to do everything in our power to protect the cast and crew." The show, with music and lyrics by U2's Bono and The Edge, is the most expensive in Broadway history, but the production has been beset by cast injuries and technical problems. CNN's John Roberts, Ethel Bass and Logan Burruss contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Director Julie Taymor faced a heartbreaking day on Wednesday after a performer in her production of "Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark" suffered a serious fall during a matinee performance. The show, which features aerial stunts and effects, has been no stranger to accidents and incidents during its run on Broadway. The performer involved in this latest accident has been identified as Christopher Tierney, and according to a spokesman for the show, he is listed in serious condition. The incident occurred during a scene in which Tierney's character, Spider-Man, is supposed to leap off a tall platform and glide across the stage. Witnesses described the moment as disturbing, with Tierney appearing to lose control mid-air and falling to the stage floor. Audience members reported hearing a loud thud as he hit the ground. The show was immediately stopped, and Tierney was taken to a nearby hospital. The postponement of Wednesday's matinee performance was announced shortly after the incident, with a spokesman for the show stating that it was necessary to allow for an investigation into what went wrong. He also stated that the safety of the performers was the show's top priority, and that they would be doing everything possible to ensure that such an incident did not happen again. Director Julie Taymor released a statement expressing her deep concern for Tierney and his family, as well as the entire "Spider-Man" company. "Our thoughts are with Chris and his loved ones at this difficult time," she said. "He is a talented performer and we are all praying for his speedy recovery." Taymor has been at the helm of "Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark" since its inception, and has faced criticism and controversy throughout its troubled production. The show, which features music by Bono and the Edge of U2, has been plagued by budget overruns and technical difficulties, and has been one of the most expensive productions in Broadway history. Despite the challenges, however, the show has proven popular with audiences, breaking box office records and drawing in crowds from around the world. Taymor, for her part, has defended the show, saying that it represents a new frontier of theatrical storytelling and that the risks are worth taking. The latest accident, however, is likely to renew concern about the show's safety record and the risks that performers are taking. Though accidents are not uncommon in the theatrical world, the high-risk nature of "Spider-Man" has drawn particular attention. In 2010, a stuntman was seriously injured in a fall during a rehearsal, and since then there have been a number of other incidents that have raised questions about the show's safety protocols. As of now, it is unclear when "Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark" will resume performances. The investigation into the cause of Wednesday's accident is ongoing, and the show's producers say that they are committed to ensuring the safety of their performers moving forward. For now, the focus remains on Christopher Tierney and his recovery, as the theater community comes together to offer support and prayers for his well-being.
