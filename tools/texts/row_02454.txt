article: Roy Hodgson's fears about the Wembley surface appear set to be realised after the Slovenian team trained inside the stadium on Friday night and claimed the centre of the pitch was 'completely ruined'. Hodgson has been concerned about wear and tear on the pitch after a series of three American Football games in recent weeks, culminating when the Dallas Cowboys and the Jacksonville Jaguars clashed on Sunday.

Evidence of the NFL game remains and remnants of the yardage marks and team logos which were emblazoned across the pitch will be plain to see for those inside a sold-out Wembley and the armchair audience at home. More worrying for Hodgson and his England team will be the state of the turf. It appears perfectly clear on the wings, because the American Football play on a narrower pitch, but a strip down the centre looked heavy and was cutting up last night after a day of steady rain as the Slovenians trained.

It is not a return to the bad-old days when the pitch inside the new stadium was a complete embarrassment, but one of the Slovenian backroom team said: 'The centre of the pitch is completely ruined. There is a 10 metre square of grass where there is no grass at all.' Hodgson aired his thoughts last weekend, claiming the pitch was 'not in the best of nick' and met with stadium officials to clear the air, as Wembley confirmed more NFL fixtures for next autumn.

'The pitch will be in the same condition for both teams. We must play here and we can't change. It is the same for all the players if the pitch is bad or super or synthetic.'

chatgpt: A recent set of American Football games has severely damaged a portion of the Wembley pitch, making it a cause for concern as England prepares for their crucial Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia on Saturday. The extensive use of the stadium for non-football events has been a topic of debate for some time, and this damage serves as yet another reminder of the impact that these events can have on the sacred ground of Wembley. England manager Roy Hodgson had already voiced his concern over the state of the field, even before the recent set of American Football games. "The pitch is not in the best of nick," he had said, "it did cut up quite badly towards the end of the last game (against San Marino). We're hoping it will improve before Saturday, but it's not perfect. It's not easy when you're playing on a surface which is not in the best of condition." However, despite Hodgson's concerns, it appears that the pitch has suffered more damage than expected. The NFL games that were played at Wembley over the weekend have resulted in a significant section of the pitch having to be relaid, with the grass still loose and prone to movement. The groundskeepers have been working around the clock to try and get the pitch back in perfect condition, but the time frame is tight and there is no guarantee that it will be ready for Saturday's match. This is particularly worrisome for England, who desperately need a win against Slovenia to remain in contention for a place in the Euro 2016 tournament. While it's true that both teams will be playing on the same pitch, the home advantage that England has typically enjoyed at Wembley will be somewhat lessened if the pitch is not in optimal condition. Furthermore, Slovenia has proven to be a formidable opponent in past matches, so England cannot afford to take any chances. The issue of non-football events leading to damage on the Wembley pitch is not a new one. The stadium has been used for a variety of functions over the years, from concerts to boxing matches, and there has always been debate over the impact that these events have on the quality of the turf. While Wembley officials have always maintained that the stadium can handle multiple events throughout the year, it seems that the recent NFL games have proven to be too much for the delicate grass. As the clock ticks down to Saturday's crucial match, all eyes will be on the Wembley pitch. The hope is that the groundskeepers will be able to get the playing surface back in top shape, but until then, England and Slovenia will have to prepare to play on a pitch that is less than ideal. For England, the stakes are high - a win is essential, and any slip-ups could prove disastrous. As always, the beauty of football lies in its unpredictability, and only time will tell how this latest development will impact the outcome of the match.
