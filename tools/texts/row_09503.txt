Another arrives home to find his precious golf clubs strewn across the driveway. One ends up being hit in the crotch with a flying water pistol. The other steps on a toy rake with very painful consequences. This is fatherhood Durex style, where far from enjoying father and son bonding or adoring looks from an admiring little daughter, becoming a daddy means facing a daily assault course of mess and annoyance - plus some excruciating injuries to the nether regions. Now the condom manufacturer's dystopian vision of daddyhood has gone viral - perhaps driven by real-life fathers ruefully wishing they'd taken the Durex advice. Scroll down for video . Misery: The father is hit in the face with a plastic sword followed by an even more painful strike to the crotch . Ruined: This father contemplates his wrecked golf clubs before being smacked in the crotch with a toy rake . Set to the sombre strains of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, the fashionably low-lit ad has already had more than 172,000 views on Youtube and begins with a miserable looking father wearily watching sausages burn on a barbecue. He looks back to see his wife screaming at his squabbling children, who are busy flinging water at each other, before turning back to the grill with a grimace. But things take a turn for the worse, when his son whacks him in the face with a plastic sword while another hoses both him and the barbecue down with a water pistol before the toy is thrown - hitting him painfully in the crotch. Father number two wearily arrives home to find his driveway strewn with toys and rubbish, among which, to his horror, are his beloved golf clubs. Argh! This naughty child knocks his father's hot cup of coffee straight into his lap . Relaxation? Forget it! There's no peace for this father but there is a body slam . As he turns away, sad-faced, he treads on the end of a toy rake which springs up and whacks him  - where else - in his crotch. Then comes a father who is trying to work from home, hindered by his small son who climbs up his chair smacking him on the head and making him drop his coffee. Like his fellow fathers, the scalding coffee and cup drop straight onto his lap. The final father is seen attempting to relax and watch TV while his children indulge in a pillow fight around him. Giving up, he puts on his headphones and lies back to relax. But unbeknown to him, his son has scaled the side of the sofa and is preparing to remind men why they should wear a condom as he launches himself straight in to his daddy's most delicate region.

chatgpt: Durex’s latest commercial on YouTube titled “Protect Yourself” has stirred quite the controversy. The ad, which has had over 172,000 views, showcases a series of unfortunate events that stem from unprotected sex.  The commercial features four fathers who are all eagerly awaiting the arrival of their newborns. Each father is seen getting hit in the crotch as they engage in physical activity with their children. The message is clear – unprotected sex can lead to unwanted pregnancies and a lifetime of parenting responsibilities.  While the premise of the ad may seem comical, many viewers have expressed their disapproval of the violent nature of the commercial. Some have even gone as far as to label it as “offensive”.  Durex has defended the ad, stating that it was created to raise awareness about the importance of safe sex. The company believes that it is imperative to educate people on the consequences of unprotected sex, especially during a time when teenage pregnancy rates are on the rise.  The “Protect Yourself” ad also highlights other potential pitfalls of unprotected sex. In addition to getting hit in the crotch, the fathers in the commercial have their possessions destroyed by their rambunctious children. This serves as a metaphor for the way in which an unwanted pregnancy can disrupt one’s life plans and goals. Despite the negative feedback, there are those who believe that the ad is effective in driving home the message of being responsible when it comes to sex. Social media influencer, Amy Hargreaves, stated that “While the ad may be extreme, it definitely gets the message across. It shows the real-life consequences of unprotected sex that many people fail to consider.” Others have hailed Durex for their bold and innovative approach to advertising. The ad is seen as a departure from the traditional “sex sells” approach that many condom companies tend to take. Instead of relying on sexual imagery, Durex has chosen to focus on the consequences of not using protection. Regardless of the controversy, it is undeniable that the “Protect Yourself” ad has sparked a conversation surrounding the topic of safe sex. It has also acted as a wake-up call for those who may have been unaware of the potential consequences of unprotected sex.  As we continue to navigate through a world where access to contraception and comprehensive sex education is limited, it is important that we talk about safe sex openly and honestly. Ads such as Durex’s “Protect Yourself” may be uncomfortable to watch, but they serve as a reminder of the importance of being responsible when it comes to sex.
