article: Harsh sentence: Editor Raif Badawi set up a liberal website in Saudi Arabia . The editor of a Saudi Arabian social website has been sentenced to seven years in prison and 600 lashes for founding an Internet forum that violates Islamic values and propagates liberal thought, Saudi media reported on Tuesday. Raif Badawi, who started the 'Free Saudi Liberals' website to discuss the role of religion in Saudi Arabia, has been held since June 2012 on charges of cyber crime and disobeying his father - a crime in the conservative kingdom and top U.S. ally. Al-Watan newspaper said the judge had also ordered the closure of the website. France was concerned by the sentence . and remained committed to 'freedom of opinion and of expression', the . foreign ministry said in a statement. Officials from the Saudi National . Society for Human Rights could not be reached for comment.

Judges base their decisions on their own interpretation of religious law rather than on a written legal code or on precedent. King Abdullah, Saudi Arabia's ruler, has pushed for reforms to the legal system, including improved training for judges and the introduction of precedent to standardise verdicts and make courts more transparent. However, Saudi lawyers say that conservatives in the Justice Ministry and the judiciary have resisted implementing many of the changes announced in 2007.

chatgpt: Raif Badawi, a Saudi Arabian blogger and activist, has been accused of cyber crime and disobeying his father. Badawi had previously set up the website Free Saudi Liberals in order to disclose the role of religion in government and society in Saudi Arabia. However, a Saudi Arabian judge has ordered that the site be closed down. Badawi's case has been widely covered in the international media, with many human rights organizations calling for his release. Supporters of Badawi view his case as an example of the Saudi Arabian government's attempts to stifle freedom of speech and expression. Badawi was arrested in 2012 and charged with insulting Islam through his website. In May 2014, he was also convicted of "disobeying his father" and sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes. His lawyer, Waleed Abu al-Khair, was also imprisoned for 15 years on charges of "undermining the regime and officials," as well as "inciting public opinion." The case has also caused diplomatic tension between the Saudi Arabian government and several Western countries. In January 2015, Badawi was publicly flogged in Jeddah, receiving 50 lashes in the first of a series of weekly floggings. This sparked global outrage, with governments and human rights organizations speaking out against the punishment. Badawi's wife, Ensaf Haidar, now lives in Canada with their three children and has been campaigning for her husband's release. In 2015, Badawi was awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought by the European Parliament. The prize is awarded annually to individuals who have made an outstanding contribution to the promotion of human rights and democracy around the world. Despite international pressure, the Saudi Arabian government has refused to release Badawi, insisting that the country's legal system is independent and impartial. The government has also defended its laws, stating that they are based on Islamic Sharia law and are designed to protect the country's moral values. Many human rights organizations, however, argue that the laws are being used to stifle freedom of speech and expression, and to suppress political dissent. There have been several high-profile cases in recent years, including the imprisonment of several prominent human rights activists. The case of Raif Badawi continues to generate international attention and calls for his release. His trial and imprisonment have become a symbol of the struggle for freedom of expression and human rights in Saudi Arabia, and a reminder of the ongoing challenges faced by activists throughout the world.
