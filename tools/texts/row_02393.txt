A postal worker claiming disability benefits after injuring herself on the job has been accused of being a liar after she appeared on The Price is Right and spun the 'big wheel' twice without difficulty. Cathy Wrench Cashwell, a grandmother from Fayetteville, North Carolina, said that she was unable to lift trays of mail after she hurt her shoulder while at work in 2004. But she pleaded guilty to fraud in federal court on Monday after an indictment claimed she appeared physically well while on the game show in September 2009. Caught: Cathy Wrench Cashwell, pictured with her husband, allegedly claimed disability benefits for an injured shoulder even though she was seen spinning the wheel twice on The Price is Right . It explained that she 'raised her left arm above her head and gripped the handle with her left hand' during her first spin of the wheel, WRAL reported. On the second spin, she 'raised both arms above her head and gripped the same handle with both hands', the September 2012 indictment added. But the game show, where contestants guess the prices of items and then spin the wheel for more money, was not the only time Cashwell was caught allegedly swindling her employers. In August 2010, she allegedly went zip-lining on a Carnival Cruise vacation, and in 2011, she was seen lifting furniture and bags of groceries with both of her arms. Game show: Host Drew Carey and a contestant are pictured by the big wheel, which players spin for cash . 'Caught': Cashwell also allegedly lifted furniture and rode of a zipline while on a cruise . Despite this physical activity, Cashwell wrote on worker's compensation paperwork in 2011 that she could not 'stand, sit, kneel, squat, climb, bend, reach or grasp', WRAL reported. 'I've seen every kind of case you can see,' said private investigator Allison Blackman. 'Sometimes you have to get in the woods and bushes. The secret is you've got to have your camera up, when they do what they're doing.' Cashwell will be sentenced in September.

chatgpt: A woman from North Carolina, Cathy Wrench Cashwell, who claimed she had injured her shoulder in a workplace accident in 2004 and was unable to perform her duties as a postal worker, was recently caught on camera participating in a popular television game show. The video footage shows her reaching for and spinning the game showâ€™s big wheel, among other physically demanding tasks. According to court documents, the 49-year-old Cashwell filed a workers' compensation claim against the United States Postal Service, saying that she suffered from limited range of motion and loss of strength in her right arm and shoulder as a result of the 2004 accident. She also claimed that it was impossible for her to lift mail, reach, grasp or kneel, making it impossible for her to perform her duties at work. However, her appearance on the game show, which was filmed in 2009, tells a different story. In addition to spinning the wheel, she was also filmed going on a zipline and lifting furniture and groceries. The footage was later used as evidence against her in a federal court case. Cashwell eventually pleaded guilty to fraudulently receiving over $58,000 in workers' compensation benefits, and was sentenced to 30 months in prison, followed by three years of supervised release. She was also ordered to pay restitution to the workers' compensation program in the amount of $52,000. During her sentencing, Cashwell's defense argued that she had been going through a difficult time in her life and made a "stupid decision." They also pointed out that she had already paid back a portion of the benefits she received. The U.S. Department of Labor, which oversees the workers' compensation program, issued a statement saying that they take fraud very seriously, and will investigate and prosecute those who try to cheat the system. Cashwell's case serves as a warning to others who may be considering similar fraudulent activities, that the consequences could be severe. The workers' compensation program is meant to provide financial assistance to those who have been legitimately injured on the job, and fraud undermines the program's effectiveness. In conclusion, Cathy Wrench Cashwell's case shows that fraudulently claiming workers' compensation benefits can result in serious legal repercussions. It is important for individuals to understand the consequences of their actions and to be honest in their claims for assistance.
