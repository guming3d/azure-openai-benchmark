article: It's the luxury Ibizan villa where William and Kate once enjoyed  a romantic getaway – now holidaymakers can enjoy the same experience... provided they can stump up the £20,000-a-week rent. Kate’s ‘black sheep’ uncle Gary Goldsmith has started marketing the La Maison de Bang Bang – supposedly named after the island’s ‘banging’ dance music scene – as a high-class getaway. In 2006 the Royal couple stayed at the house, where IT recruitment millionaire Mr Goldsmith, 48, was once caught apparently chopping up lines of cocaine in a tabloid sting. Dipping into the savings: The villa has a swimming pool as luxurious as you would expect for £20,000 a week . Hit the decks: Prince William tried his hand at DJing on this terrace when he and Kate Middleton stayed in 2006 . Perfectly luxurious: Gary Goldsmith put the villa on the market for £6million last year, but couldn't find a buyer . At your service: A peculiar statue of a moustachioed butler delivering champagne is just one quirky feature .

Unconventional figure: Mr Goldsmith is a self-made millionaire whose reported drug problems and disregard for convention has nevertheless made him an embarrassment to the Royal family and the Middletons . Last year he put it on the market for £6 million, but with no buyers, he’s renting it out through a website full of glossy pictures – and spelling mistakes. For example, it boasts that staff can organise activities such as ‘raikhi [and] body ballencing’ and can ‘help with vegitarian cuiseen, as well as help drive you around a bit and sort tables at clubs and resturants’. There’s also a ‘Jacquzzi’. Quirky decor includes two gold thrones, a curious statue of a moustachioed butler and a 12ft Buddha overlooking a pool terrace where William tried his hand as a DJ. But there is one drawback: the villa is near the flightpath for Ibiza airport, just two miles away.

Sofa, so good: The luxurious lounge benefits from patio doors with views extending out towards the pool . A good taste in music: The dining room features a jukebox and a grand table with space for ten at supper time . Dramatic: The pool seems lit in glorious ultraviolet at night - which is perhaps another nod to Ibizan rave culture . Semi-literate: The website advertising the luxurious villa for rent is littered with spelling mistakes . Jet set: The villa's location, near the Ibiza airport runway, means tenants may want to keep the music turned up .

chatgpt: Royal Couple’s Stay at Eccentric “Bangalow” on Ibiza’s Flightpath The Royal couple’s 2006 visit to the beautiful Mediterranean island of Ibiza included a much-talked-about stay at a unique villa known for its eccentric décor and curious name. The “Bangalow,” as it is called, is apparently named in tribute to the lively music scene on this Balearic island.  The Bangalow is situated on the flightpath for Ibiza airport, a fact that many of its guests find to be the one drawback of an otherwise delightful experience. Despite this, the villa is a popular destination for many visitors to Ibiza, including celebrities and other high-profile individuals. The Bangalow is an unusual and unforgettable place to stay. Situated near the village of San Carlos, the villa is surrounded by lush vegetation, and decorated with colorful murals and mosaics. Inside, the decor is similarly eclectic, with vintage furniture, funky artwork, and a wide range of decorative objects that reflect the owner’s love for all things quirky and unusual.  Perhaps the most striking aspect of the Bangalow’s design is its use of vibrant color, which is reflected both inside and outside the building. From the bright blue exterior walls to the rich red and purple accents in the living spaces, the Bangalow is a feast for the eyes.  Despite the villa’s unusual design, the Royal couple reportedly enjoyed their stay there. The Bangalow is situated in a tranquil and secluded location, surrounded by gardens and fruit groves, and is ideal for those seeking a peaceful retreat. Inside, the villa’s spacious living areas are equipped with all the modern amenities one would expect, including air conditioning, internet access, and a fully equipped kitchen.  Though the villa’s close proximity to the airport can be a downside, many of the Bangalow’s guests have overlooked this minor inconvenience in favor of the villa’s unique personality and charm.  The Bangalow has become something of a destination for lovers of the surreal and the unexpected, and is considered one of Ibiza’s most iconic buildings. Despite its popularity, however, the villa remains a well-kept secret, and is a favorite of those seeking something off the beaten path. If you are looking for unique accommodations in Ibiza, the Bangalow is definitely worth considering. With its vibrant style, tranquil location, and proximity to some of the island’s most popular attractions, it is an ideal place to enjoy your stay on this beautiful Mediterranean island.
