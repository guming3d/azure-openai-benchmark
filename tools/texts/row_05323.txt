article: (CNN) -- Could a floating dome that can house up to 10,000 people be a model for future living? Russian architect Alexander Remizov thinks so -- and his prototype design, called "The Ark," bears more than a passing resemblance to the classic children's toy, the Slinky. Remizov believes his Ark, designed to be constructed from timber, steel and high-strength ETFE plastic, could be adapted for all kinds of environments and put to a number of different uses, including emergency housing -- its prefabricated structure should allow it to be constructed quickly -- and hotels. He's even suggested a variation with a honeycomb-style hull that can float. After completing a Masters degree looking at non-polluting settlements, Remizov decided to pursue that theme with his architecture firm Remistudio and design a modern building that would be in harmony with the environment. He says that he took a holistic approach to the problems of providing power to The Ark, working with colleague Lev Britvin on energy solutions to keep it in balance with the environment. A wind power generator that runs through the center of the building would provide power while the outer surface would be covered with transparent solar panels. If the Ark was built on water, as Remizov suggests, he says it could also utilize thermal water energy. "The form of a dome promotes the formation of turbulences of air, strengthening the work of wind generators," wrote Remizov in an email to CNN. "Inside the building, the dome form promotes accumulation of warm air in the top part of a building," he continued. "This heat will be transformed to other kinds of energy and collects also in thermal accumulators." While still on the drawing board, Remizov believes The Ark could be used for many purposes from apartments to offices and hotels, and be built on different scales to house between 50 and 10,000 people. The way in which the Ark could be assembled from ready-made structures would reduce the cost of construction, suggests Remizov, who estimates that it would be comparable to the cost of energy-efficient "green" buildings. "Lightweight materials, such as coating film, light design of the foundation, no insulation due to the presence of the buffer zone, reduce the weight structures, which would lead to cheaper construction," he said.

chatgpt: Russian architect Vasily Klyukin has designed an innovative and sustainable building called The Ark, which aims to achieve a balance between architecture and the natural world. The multi-use building is made to be environmentally friendly and can be used as a floating platform for various purposes. One of the unique features of The Ark is the use of transparent solar cells on the building's outer surface, which allows natural light to pass through while simultaneously harnessing solar energy from the sun. Additionally, the building is equipped with a central wind generator that helps to generate electricity on-site. The concept is centered around the idea of creating a building that is in perfect balance with nature. Klyukin believes that a building can be environmentally conscious and modern, without sacrificing design or functionality. The Ark is meant to be an example of this belief in practice. One concept of The Ark's design involves it being able to float on water. The building's floating characteristics would be made possible by a series of pontoons located at the buildings base. This enables the building to be used to generate renewable energy from offshore sources or serve as a seaworthy platform for various events. The versatility of the building is also an intriguing aspect of its design. The Ark can be utilized for a wide range of purposes such as housing, offices, events, hospitals, and hotels. The building is expected to have a lifespan of around 100 years, which is impressive given the continued increase in building construction worldwide. Klyukin intends to present The Ark's design to various organizations and governing bodies as a solution to their environmental challenges. With the help of forward-thinking organizations and activists, he believes the building can become a reality and make a significant impact on the world. The architect believes that The Ark's design can serve as an example that green architecture can be both effective and efficient, as well as aesthetically pleasing. He hopes to inspire future designs that take into account the need for sustainable construction, creating buildings that are both functional and environmentally friendly. Overall, The Ark represents a significant advancement in sustainable architecture, utilizing innovative technology and design concepts to create a building that is in harmony with nature. It will be interesting to see how Klyukin's design will influence the future of architecture and construction, as well as how quickly it could be made into a reality.
