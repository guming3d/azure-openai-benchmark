article: A doctor's office left a McDonald's cheeseburger and fries along with a Taco Bell chicken taco in the open-air for two years to monitor what happened. The answer? Not a lot. As the fast-food approaches its two-year anniversary on the counter of the chiropractors' surgery in Waterford, Michigan, the meals appear weirdly unchanged - with no decay and no funky smells. Dr Jacqueline Vaughn, of Vaughn Chiropractic, told Daily Mail Online on Wednesday that she hoped to make people think about what they were putting in their bodies - especially her fast-food loving younger patients. Scroll down for video . Doctors in Michigan left out some fast food for two years at their Michigan clinic - only to find out that it changes very little and emanates no smells . She said: 'There's no smell from it, it's basically mummified. You can pick it up, turn it over and still see the cheese and pickle in the burger and the lettuce and cheese in the Taco Bell. 'Even in the summer when we get ants, the bugs won't go near it.' Dr Vaughn said that she planned to keep the fast-food on display 'forever'. Wayne State University professor of food science Yafan Zhang told CBS that it's a preservative called calcium probinate that keeps the food looking almost still edible for a long time. The burger (above) and the taco appeared 'mummified', the doctors said, but had not rotted after two years in the open air . The preservative is used in a range of products to keep them fresh such as bread, cakes and processed meat. It is non-toxic and approved safe to use, following rigorous labratory testing. Dr Zhang also told CBS: 'These ingredients, they have potential to cause some inflammation in our stomachs... unless you eat a lot of this type of food everyday – then you will be okay.' Eight out of ten Americans admit visiting fast-food restaurants each month - and half of people eat there at least once a week, according to a 2013 Gallup study. Young adults, aged from 18 to 29, eat fast food most often with more than half saying they do so at least once a week.

chatgpt: It's a milestone that no one ever really expected - the McDonald's cheeseburger has just celebrated its two-year anniversary at a doctor's office in Michigan. Despite its age, the fast food sandwich appears almost untouched, with no signs of decay or strange smells permeating from it. According to Dr Jacqueline Vaughn, who oversees the burger's resting place at her office, the food looks like something out of an ancient Egypt exhibit, it seems almost "mummified." The story of the perfectly preserved McDonald's cheeseburger has been making waves across the internet, and for good reason. While fast food is generally known for its short lifespan, the fact that this sandwich has been able to withstand the test of time is nothing short of remarkable. However, its newfound fame is not something that Dr Vaughn takes lightly. Instead of simply letting the burger sit and collect dust, she plans to use it as a tool to educate her patients on the importance of healthy eating. She plans to keep the burger at her office indefinitely, using it as an example of what can happen when we rely too heavily on processed foods and neglect our diets. While the idea of using a fast food burger as a prop in a doctor's office may seem like an unusual tactic, it is one that Dr Vaughn believes will have a lasting impact on her patients. As she puts it, "The longevity of this burger is quite alarming. We want people to understand that eating fast food can have serious consequences on our health, and this burger is evidence of that." Of course, the story of the McDonald's cheeseburger's impressive lifespan is not without its skeptics. Some have suggested that the burger may have been treated with preservatives or other additives that would allow it to last longer than expected. Others wonder if it may have simply been a stroke of luck that the burger has lasted as long as it has. Regardless of the reasons behind its long life, the fact remains that the McDonald's cheeseburger is a symbol of the unhealthy eating habits that plague many Americans today. It serves as a reminder that while fast food may be convenient and tasty, it is not always the best choice for our bodies. As for the burger itself, it will continue to sit on Dr Vaughn's counter, a testament to the power of processed foods and the importance of making healthy choices. Perhaps its legacy will be that of a cautionary tale, a warning of the dangers of fast food and a reminder of the importance of taking care of ourselves.
