article: (CNN) -- Sing in the shower, not in public. That's the message to anyone visiting one South Carolina beach community. The town of Sullivan's Island has proposed an ordinance that would make it illegal to belt out show tunes, pop songs, or any musical notes, for that matter, if they disturb the peace. "I haven't had one islander complain about it," said Andy Benke, the town administrator. "There are places where you can go and be loud and vociferous. Sullivan's Island is not one of them." "We want you to have a good time but in the same sense we want you to act respectful and if you don't we have a tool to deal with it," Benke added. That tool would be a ticket from a police officer for a maximum fine of $500. And the ban isn't just for singing. The measure reads as follows: . "It shall be unlawful for any person to yell, shout, hoot, whistle, or sing on the public streets, particularly between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. or at any time or place so as to annoy or disturb the comfort, or repose of persons in any office, or in any dwelling, or other type of residence, or of any persons in the vicinity." The town, which is on a barrier island just north of Charleston Harbor, has a population of about 2,000 but swells to around 5,000 during summer weekends, Benke said. He called it "first and foremost a single residential community. "There are a lot of visitors to the beach 24 hours a day," he said, "and we just need a way to maintain the quiet family atmosphere." The town council has already voted two times for the ordinance and after a third vote in July, it is expected to be put into effect in August, Benke said. He said the welcome mat is always open for people to enjoy the town but made it clear loud, disruptive noises, including public singing during quiet hours, will not be tolerated. "There are probably six or seven little restaurants in the town that stay open until 2 a.m.," he said. "People are leaving, (having) had a good time all night. Maybe they don't know they are being loud and think it's okay. But it's not."

chatgpt: Residents of the quiet beach town of Sullivan's Island are taking steps to preserve their peaceful way of life. The town, located just north of Charleston, South Carolina, is considering an ordinance that would impose hefty fines on those who violate its noise regulations. Under the proposed ordinance, violators could face a maximum fine of $500 for noise disturbances. This includes loud music, raucous parties, and other loud noises that disrupt the town's tranquility. The move comes after complaints from residents who feel that Sullivan's Island is becoming too noisy. "Places you can go and be loud ... Sullivan's Island is not one of them," said an official from the town. "We want to preserve our small-town feel and our way of life, and excessive noise is not part of that." Sullivan's Island is known for its stunning beaches and relaxed atmosphere. The town is home to around 1,800 residents, many of whom enjoy the peace and quiet that comes with living in a small beach town. However, some visitors and residents have been accused of being too noisy, disturbing the town's peaceful ambiance. If the ordinance is passed, it will be enforced by the Sullivan's Island Police Department. The police will have the authority to issue citations to those who violate the noise regulations. The fines will range from $100 to $500, depending on the severity of the violation. The proposed ordinance has received mixed reactions from residents and visitors alike. Some feel that it is necessary to maintain the town's charm, while others believe it is an overreach of government power. Many visitors, in particular, have expressed concerns that the ordinance will discourage them from visiting Sullivan's Island. However, officials from the town stress that they are not trying to discourage tourism or restrict people's freedom to have fun. They simply want to maintain a balance between a vibrant social scene and a peaceful community. "We love having visitors and sharing our beautiful town with them," the official said. "But we also want them to respect our way of life and understand that we value peace and quiet. We believe this ordinance strikes the right balance." The ordinance is still under consideration, and it is unclear when or if it will be passed. But for residents of Sullivan's Island, the effort to keep things quiet is a clear sign that they are committed to preserving the town's unique charm and peaceful lifestyle.
