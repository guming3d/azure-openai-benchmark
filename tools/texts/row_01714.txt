article: Twenty years ago, a team of researchers shared the Web with the world. Now they want to show a generation that grew up online what it was like in its earliest days. The European Organization for Nuclear Research, known as CERN, is celebrating the 20th anniversary of the date it released, for free, the technology and software needed to run a Web server. In honor of the anniversary, a team has been assembled to recreate a working version of the first website, a how-to guide hosted by the project's creators. The organization issued a statement on April 30, 1993, that announced the release of that Web to the public. British physicist Tim Berners-Lee created and named the Web (also commonly called "W3" for short in those days) in 1989 at CERN. Originally, it was designed as a way for scientists at different universities and other institutes to share information. "Vague, but exciting," Berners-Lee's supervisor wrote on the cover of a proposal while greenlighting the project. See a 1993 copy of the first website . By 1993, there were roughly 400 known Web servers. But the World Wide Web accounted for only about 1% of Internet traffic. The rest was remote access to computer networks, e-mail and file transfers from one computer to another. Since then it has, obviously, become a constant presence in the lives of people around the world. Today, there are somewhere around 630 million websites. "There is no sector of society that has not been transformed by the invention, in a physics laboratory, of the Web," said Rolf Heuer, CERN's director-general. "From research to business and education, the Web has been reshaping the way we communicate, work, innovate and live. The Web is a powerful example of the way that basic research benefits humankind." The first website was, not surprisingly, devoted to the Web project itself, describing how to use it and set up a Web server. It was hosted on Berner-Lee's NeXt computer -- the product developed at a company founded by Steve Jobs before he returned to Apple. That computer is still at CERN's headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. But it no longer hosts that first website. CERN's team aims to change that, restoring the earliest versions of files that were on the site as well as making it a home for stories about those formative days. They'll be combing CERN's servers for data preserved from that time.

chatgpt: The team that originally created the World Wide Web is on a mission to recreate its first-ever site. The effort is spearheaded by researchers at CERN, the European particle physics laboratory where Tim Berners-Lee first devised the idea for the web back in 1989.  The World Wide Web, which was released free to the public on April 30, 1993, has become an integral part of modern life, but CERN researchers want to preserve the history of the web and ensure that future generations can see what it was like in its early days. Thus, they are working to rebuild the very first website, which went live in 1991 and has since been lost to the sands of time.  The original website was a simple one-page affair hosted on Berners-Lee's NeXT computer. It featured little more than text and a handful of hyperlinks that directed users to other pages, but it marked the beginning of a new era in digital communication that has transformed the world in countless ways.  The process of recreating the first website is no easy feat. While the original site was hosted on a computer at CERN, the hardware is long gone, and the files have been lost or corrupted. For this reason, the team has been scouring through old records and archives to piece together as much information as possible.  So far, they have managed to retrieve a significant amount of the necessary data, including old server logs and original code fragments, which will allow them to rebuild the website as accurately as possible. To do so, they are using an open-source platform called WorldWideWeb, which Berners-Lee himself created in the early days of the web.  The new website will be hosted on modern servers and accessible to anyone, just like the original. The team hopes that it will give visitors a chance to experience what the web was like in its earliest days, and to appreciate how far it has come since then. They also hope that it will inspire a new generation of programmers and web developers to carry on the legacy of the original creators of the web.  Rebuilding the first website is just one of several efforts underway to preserve the early days of the web. Initiatives like the Internet Archive and the Web Foundation are working to archive and protect important digital content and promote accessibility to the web for all.  In an age where the internet is an ever-present part of daily life, it is easy to forget where it all began. But thanks to efforts like this one, we can ensure that the history of the web is not lost to time, and that future generations can appreciate the humble beginnings that led to the digital world we know today.
