The poster girl of the Paralympics looks set to take on rival Victoria Arlen on Saturday, after the American was reinstated in her category following an appeal. World record holder Arlen, 17, was ruled ‘ineligible’ for the Games on Monday, as her impairment was not deemed severe enough to qualify for her allocated category.

But the International Paralympic Committee yesterday upheld the American team’s appeal and said she would be allowed to compete in the same ‘S6’ swimming classification as Simmonds. Simmonds became known as the darling of the pool at Beijing in 2008, when she won golds in the 100m and 400m freestyle at the age of just 13. Now 17, Simmonds, who has dwarfism, is hoping to defend those titles against Arlen, who broke both of her world records at the US trials in June. The American was paralysed in 2006 by a virus which affected her spinal cord and left her in a vegetative state for two years. On Saturday she will face Simmonds in the heats of the 400m freestyle, with a final decision as to her classification being made after this contest.

World-beater: Ellie Simmonds, who has dwarfism, won golds in the 100m and 400m freestyle in Beijing . Before the Games, Simmonds named Arlen as her greatest rival, telling the BBC: ‘It’s given me a bit of a buzz really, a bit of determination. ‘I’m a very competitive person and being behind the blocks, knowing that she is the world record holder and that I have to beat her, is really exciting.’ Simmonds is competing for four medals,  in the 50m, 100m and 400m freestyle and the 200m individual medley. And the pressure is on – following her double gold in Beijing, she was named the BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year, and became the youngest person ever to be awarded the MBE. Speaking about this year’s Games, she said: ‘Four years ago it was all new for me. 'Now I know coming into the Games what a Paralympics is like, how big an event it is. 'It’s definitely going to be a big event being at a home Games. 'It’s exciting, but it’s quite scary.’ Showdown: Ellie Simmonds, pictured with her coach Billy Pye (left), has named Victoria Arlen (right) as her greatest rival.

chatgpt: In a dramatic turn of events in the world of Paralympic swimming, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) has ruled in favor of the United States' appeal to allow Victoria Arlen to compete in the Paralympic Games. This ruling has overturned an earlier decision that had deemed Arlen ineligible due to her impairment not being severe enough. The IPC's reversal comes as a significant relief for Arlen, who is a fierce competitor and the greatest rival of British swimmer Ellie Simmonds. In June, Arlen had broken both of Simmonds's world records in stunning fashion, setting the stage for an epic showdown between the two swimmers at the Paralympic Games. Simmonds has been preparing for this moment for years, aiming to add to her already impressive tally of five Paralympic gold medals. Arlen's presence in the pool added an extra layer of anticipation to the event, with the two swimmers likely to be neck-and-neck and pushing each other to the limit. The controversy surrounding Arlen's eligibility had threatened to derail this highly anticipated clash, but the IPC's decision has put an end to this uncertainty. For Arlen, this ruling has been a vindication of sorts, as she had to endure a lengthy and grueling appeal process before finally being cleared to compete. The IPC's decision has also set an important precedent for future Paralympic Games. It sends a message that athletes who have worked hard and demonstrated their talent and dedication should not be disqualified based on arbitrary criteria. This ruling underscores the importance of fairness and equality in the world of Paralympic sports. Simmonds, for her part, has welcomed the news of Arlen's inclusion in the Games, and she is preparing to give her best performance in what promises to be an exciting race. The swimming world is abuzz with anticipation as these two champions get ready to face off in what could be one of the defining moments of the Games. As the countdown to the Paralympic Games begins, fans around the world will be eagerly waiting to see the outcome of this epic rivalry. The stakes are high, and the competition promises to be intense. For Arlen and Simmonds, this will be a chance to showcase their skills and show the world what they are capable of achieving. In the end, the decision to allow Arlen to compete is a testament to the power of persistence and determination. Arlen refused to give up in the face of adversity, and her grit and resilience have paid off. Her medal hopes have been restored, and the world will be watching as she takes to the pool, ready to make history.
