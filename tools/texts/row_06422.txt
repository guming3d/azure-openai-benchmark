article: LONDON, England (CNN) -- Animal rights campaigners were holding a meeting Tuesday with Britain's Ministry of Defence to argue against the use of bearskin in the iconic furry headgear worn by royal guards at Buckingham Palace. A PETA activist in Sofia, Bulgaria earlier this year protests against UK troops wearing bearskin hats. Robbie LeBlanc, European director for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), was meeting with Ann Taylor, the minister for defense equipment and support, the defense ministry said. "We are hoping that they will switch to a humane synthetic alternative," a PETA spokeswoman said. PETA has been campaigning for years against the use of bearskin in the headgear, a familiar symbol of London worn by the guards who keep watch over royal buildings like Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle. The hats are part of the footguards' ceremonial dress, along with the bright red jackets. PETA says the bears used to produce the fur hats are killed cruelly and unnecessarily. "It's an absolute moral disgrace," said Mike Hancock, a British lawmaker who has joined PETA's campaign against the bearskins. "I don't think the British public or tourists will mind if it's synthetic fur, and I'm absolutely amazed in this day and age that we see beautiful animals skinned and killed" to produce the hats. A spokesman for the National Army Museum in London, Julian Farrance, said the fur comes only from Canadian bears that have died naturally, and that no bears are killed for the hats. Campaigners say they still want the defense ministry to use a different material. "It still promotes the usage of animal fur in areas where it's totally unnecessary, in my view, for fur to be used," said Glenda Jackson, another British lawmaker opposed to the use of the fur. The British Army's use of the bearskin hats dates back to the Battle of Waterloo on in 1815, when Wellington's army defeated the French Imperial Guard in a victory that marked Napoleon's downfall. The British soldiers captured the headgear from the defeated Imperial Guardsmen and have worn them ever since, although today the hats are only worn for ceremonial duties. Those British soldiers were renamed the Grenadier Guards to honor their defeat of the Grenadiers of the French Imperial Guards. The Grenadiers are now among five bearskin-wearing regiments that guard British royal buildings. But each bearskin hat is heavy and can prove very hot for the wearer. "There have been occasions where soldiers have suffered from heatstroke, because obviously wearing that much fur on your head ... can get quite warm," Farrance said.

chatgpt: Animal rights campaigners are opposing the UK royal guards from wearing furry headgear, which has been a tradition dating back to the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. The iconic headgear has been a part of the famous uniform, distinguishing the guards and representing a link to their rich history. However, animal rights activists argue that the headgear is made from Canadian bears, whose fur is obtained by inhumane methods.  The campaigners are scheduled to demonstrate their opposition to the defense ministry in London on Tuesday. Natalie Prosser, a spokeswoman for the campaign, stated that cruel practices are used to obtain the fur, which is then used to make the headgear. Prosser noted that the bears are often shot or caught in traps, leading to long periods of suffering.  However, the army has contested these claims, stating that the fur used in the headgear is obtained from Canadian bears that have died naturally. Colonel Simon Beckett, a military expert, argued that the animals have often died naturally due to harsh weather conditions in Canada. The military expert also noted that the guards' headgear is made from a limited quantity of fur, which is replaced only once every ten years.  Canadian officials have confirmed that there is a legal and strictly controlled trade in black bearskins. The country's government has also noted that only the hides from bears that have died from natural causes, accidents, or were euthanized due to health issues are used in trade. Therefore, the harvesting of the bears' fur for commercial purposes is heavily regulated and monitored to ensure that it is done ethically.  The use of animal fur in fashion and military has been a topic of concern for animal rights activists worldwide. The campaigners argue that using animal fur is unethical and leads to inhumane practices in obtaining the fur. However, the army has defended its use of the headgear and noted that the bearskins have been an integral part of the guards' uniform for centuries.  The headgear has a significant cultural and historical value to the UK, representing the country's military tradition and the spirit of the royal guards. The government has also defended the use of the archaic headgear, stating that it is integral to the guards' identity and their role in the UK's cultural and historical heritage.  In conclusion, animal rights campaigners' opposition to the UK royal guards wearing furry headgear using bearskin is a longstanding issue. The military has defended the practice, stating that the fur comes from Canadian bears that have died naturally. The UK government has also defended the use of the headgear, citing the rich cultural and historical value it has. However, this issue highlights the tension between preserving cultural traditions and ethical practices in the fashion and military industries.
