article: (CNN) -- Country music singer Mindy McCready was hiding in the closet with her son when authorities took the 5-year-old boy into custody in Arkansas, officials said early Saturday. Authorities found Zander McCready and his mother in a home in Heber Springs, Arkansas, according to David Rahbany, the chief deputy U.S. Marshal in eastern Arkansas. "The child appeared to be in good condition when we found him ... he was in the closet with his mother," Rahbany said. Local sheriffs and marshals had placed the home -- believed to belong to the singer's boyfriend -- under surveillance for hours before they found the boy late Friday, he said. The boy is in the custody of the Arkansas Division of Children and Family Services, who will make arrangements to take him to his legal guardian in Florida, his maternal grandmother. Until recently, the boy has been living with Mindy McCready's mother and stepfather, Gayle and Michael Inge, who have legal custody. The singer, who has fought a public battle against drug addiction, has visitation rights. McCready took her son from her mother's Florida home late last month and asked a court to restore custody to her out of concern over the boy's safety. A Florida judged signed an emergency "pickup order" Thursday authorizing law enforcement officers to get the boy. McCready's mother and stepfather said they are relieved. "We feel sorrow for Zander because he's traumatized, and for Mindy," they said. "We just hope she does the right thing from here on out and that this is a wake-up call for her." McCready was not charged with a crime Friday, Rahbany said, adding it is unclear whether she faces any future charges. The singer burst on the music scene in 1996 with the debut album "10,000 Angels" and the chart-topping country hit "Guys Do It All the Time." Her website biography says she had an "explosive relationship" with the boy's father, Billy McKnight, who is a country singer. McCready participated in the 2009 season of the reality TV show "Celebrity Rehab With Dr. Drew." CNN's Tom Watkins, Phil Gast, Michael Martinez, Selin Darkalstanian, Dave Alsup and Vivian Kuo contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Country singer Mindy McCready was found hiding in a closet with her young son at a house in Arkansas under surveillance by the police. McCready had taken her five-year-old son, Zander, from her mother’s home late last month without legal custody of him. The police had been surveilling the home in Arkansas for two days before they found McCready and her son. Deputies from the U.S. Marshals Service and the Arkansas Department of Human Services had been searching for Zander since November 29, when McCready took him from her mother’s home in Florida without legal consent. The singer, who has long battled substance abuse and legal issues, was taken into custody without incident. Her son was placed in protective custody and was scheduled to be returned to his maternal grandmother in Florida. McCready gained fame during the 1990s and early 2000s with hits like “Guys Do It All the Time” and “Ten Thousand Angels.” However, she has struggled with legal and personal problems in recent years, including losing custody of her older son in 2007 and struggling with addiction and mental health issues. She also attempted suicide several times over the years. In 2011, McCready was charged with violating probation after she was found using a fake prescription to obtain the painkiller OxyContin. She was later sentenced to one year in prison for the offense. In 2013, she was hospitalized after an apparent overdose and then entered rehab before eventually losing custody of Zander to her mother. The incident has raised questions about child custody laws and the mental health of celebrities. McCready’s case highlights the difficulties of dealing with substance abuse and mental health issues in a high-pressure industry, and the potential risks associated with granting custody to individuals who may struggle with addiction or mental health issues. For now, McCready remains in custody as her legal troubles continue to mount. The fate of her young son remains uncertain, as his mother undergoes treatment for her addiction and mental health issues. The incident serves as a reminder of the challenges facing families dealing with addiction and mental health issues, and the need for comprehensive support systems to address these issues.
