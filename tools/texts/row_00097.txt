article: A series of videos appeared online Saturday purporting to show Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, the highest-ranking member of Saddam Hussein's regime to evade capture, deriding Iraq's current leadership. Al-Douri, who the U.S. military says helped finance the Sunni insurgency in Iraq, was the "king of clubs" in a deck of playing cards used by American troops following the 2003 invasion to identify the most-wanted regime officials. There have been several claims that al-Douri was either killed or captured, though a man claiming to be al-Douri has released a number of audio messages over the years taunting Iraqi and U.S. officials. Al-Douri, who served as a military commander and vice president in Hussein's Sunni-dominated regime, was last seen on video shortly after the invasion of Iraq. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the videos posted on YouTube or the identity of the man, though he bears a striking resemblance to al-Douri. In the clips, the man who claims to be al-Douri wears an olive military uniform and sits behind a desk with an Iraqi flag in the background. He derides Iraq's Shiite-dominated government, led by Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, as well as what he describes as meddling by neighboring Iran. Al-Maliki's Dawa party, says al-Douri, "has announced Iraq as the Shiite capital." He said nine years have passed since the invasion and Iraq is still in peril. "Everyone can hear the sounds of danger echoing daily and threatening the country," he said. The videos were posted on what is the 65th anniversary of the Arab Socialist Baath Party, a political party founded in Syria that later provided the political basis for Iraq's now outlawed Baath Party. The U.S. military has said al-Douri helped finance the Sunni insurgency with money he transferred to Syria before the government collapsed shortly after the U.S.-led invasion. Al-Douri was the deputy chairman of Hussein's Revolutionary Command Council, and U.S. officials have said he played a key role in the 1988 chemical attack on the Kurdish city of Halabja that left thousands dead and thousands more wounded. He also is accused of playing a role in the brutal crackdowns on Kurdish and Shiite revolts in Iraq that followed the 1991 Persian Gulf War.

chatgpt: Former senior Iraqi official Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, known as the "king of clubs" for his identification on a deck of playing cards used to locate wanted officials, has reportedly resurfaced in a video. In the clips, which were released last week, al-Douri can be seen criticizing Iraq's Shiite leaders. Al-Douri was a prominent figure during the regime of Saddam Hussein, where he served as the vice chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council. Following the overthrow of Hussein's regime in 2003, al-Douri went into hiding, and he had been reported dead on several occasions. However, in the video, he appears to be in good health and talks about the current state of Iraq. The U.S. military has accused al-Douri of funding the Sunni insurgency in Iraq that caused many deaths and injuries, and his capture or killing was a top priority for the U.S. forces during their involvement in the country. The Iraqi government has also issued an arrest warrant for al-Douri, accusing him of terrorism activities. In the video, al-Douri can be seen sitting in a chair wearing a military uniform and addressing the camera. He criticizes the current Iraqi government, which he describes as "sectarian," and calls for the formation of a national government that represents all segments of Iraqi society. Al-Douri, who is believed to be in his 70s, also accuses Iran of interfering in Iraqi affairs and backing Shiite militias that have committed atrocities against Sunni Muslims. He calls on Iraqis to unite against what he calls Iran's attempts to dominate the region. The video has sparked concern among the Iraqi authorities, who fear that it could encourage Sunni militants to launch attacks against Shiite targets. The Iraqi security forces have stepped up their efforts to track down al-Douri, and they have urged the public to report any sightings of him. Al-Douri's reappearance in the video comes at a time of heightened tensions between the U.S. and Iran, which are both vying for influence in Iraq. The U.S. has accused Iran of supporting Shiite militias in the country, and the two nations have engaged in a war of words in recent months. Al-Douri's video is a reminder of the deep divisions that continue to exist in Iraq, despite the defeat of ISIS and the ousting of the Saddam Hussein regime. The challenge now is for the Iraqi authorities to address these divisions and find a way to bring the country together.
