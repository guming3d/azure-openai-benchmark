article: (CNN)  -- Ramadan is the holiest month for Muslims around the world, a time to fast, cleanse the soul and surrender to God. But in the Middle East, there's a new twist to the tradition. Arab channels' soap operas contain enough twists to entertain through the month of Ramadan. Ramadan translates into big bucks for Arab satellite channels. Millions of dollars are spent on special programming, much of it comparable to Western soap operas, to entertain the masses during their sunrise-to-sunset fasts. One program, the popular Syrian production "Baab El-Hara" -- "The Neighborhood Gate" -- offers high drama focused on a family feud. A man and his pregnant wife are separated as their mothers fight it out, with each mother-in-law trying to teach the other a lesson. The woman misses her husband and wants to go back to him. The husband kisses his mother's hand and promises her he'll do only what she wants. The soaps showcase social traditions mixed with melodramatic characters and enough twists and turns of events to last the entire month of fasting. But it's not all soap. There are also history programs highlighting glorious times of Islamic and Arabic bygone eras. On these, the ancient Arabic tribal costumes are showcased, complete with the traditional headdress, dagger on the side and more camels than a viewer can count.  Watch a report on Ramadan television Â» . The soap opera boom during Ramadan has become the subject of hot debate on news channels. Some people have expressed concern that sitting in front of a TV set all day doesn't go well with the spirit of the month, when Muslims are supposed to be contemplating and meditating. The Dubai-based news channel Al-Arabiya found a novel way to entertain its viewers: a documentary in which the host walks in the footsteps of the prophet Mohammed as detailed in the Quran. The channel also offers a daily lighter look at Ramadan, focusing on people's health during the holy month. Recommendations on the best meals to eat are followed by descriptions of how many calories they contain. Middle Eastern cuisine is displayed to viewers just in time to break fast. That, too, is announced on TV these days, instead of the traditional cannon and call to prayer. And if Muslims decide to break their fasts with a traditional shisha smoke and a light meal in a neighborhood cafe, no worries. Satellite channels will serve them soaps there, too. It's all part of the big plan, and it happens only during Ramadan.

chatgpt: Arab TV channels have been investing millions of dollars in Ramadan programming to entertain Muslims during their month-long fasts. Programs such as soap operas, history lessons, and food shows have been especially popular, drawing in viewers from across the Middle East and North Africa. While the programming has been successful in keeping viewers engaged during the long hours of fasting, some have criticized the trend. Critics argue that sitting in front of the TV for hours on end undermines the true purpose of the holy month. Ramadan is a time when Muslims are supposed to focus on spiritual reflection and abstain from worldly pleasures. It is an opportunity to practice self-discipline, self-control, and to increase one's closeness to God. However, the abundance of TV programming has made it easy for people to lose sight of the spiritual benefits of Ramadan. In response to the criticism, some channels have sought to balance entertainment with educational programming. Channels like Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya have launched special news coverage, documentaries, and town hall-style discussions to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the issues that matter to Muslims. Other channels have tried to promote Ramadan-themed shows that emphasize the religious and spiritual significance of the month. This includes religious readings, sermons, and discussions on the Prophet Muhammad's life. Despite the efforts by some channels to strike a balance, many viewers are still drawn to the entertaining shows that have dominated Ramadan programming for years. "I watch Ramadan TV shows every year," said 35-year-old Emirati citizen, Ahmed Al-Suwaidi. "I find them very entertaining and they make the fast go by more quickly." Critics, however, argue that the trend is a reflection of a larger cultural shift towards materialism and consumerism in the Middle East. They argue that the focus on entertainment undermines the spiritual significance of Ramadan and detracts from the overarching values of Islam. Ultimately, the debate over the role of TV programming during Ramadan speaks to the larger question of how Muslims can balance the demands of modern life with the spiritual principles of their faith. While some argue that entertainment programming undermines the true purpose of the holy month, others contend that it provides a necessary outlet for people to relax and unwind after a long day of fasting. As the month of Ramadan continues, it remains to be seen what impact the growing trend of TV programming will have on the spiritual lives of Muslims across the region.
