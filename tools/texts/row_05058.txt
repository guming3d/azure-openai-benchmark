article: (CNN) -- Rafael Nadal made light work of Marcos Daniel in his first grass outing of the season at the Aegon Championships in London. The world number one took just 50 minutes to win 6-2 6-2 over the Brazilian serve-and-volleyer at the Queen's Club. Just three days after securing his fifth French Open title in Paris, Nadal showed little sign of heavy legs, in securing his 23rd successive victory. Nadal raced into a 3-0 lead in the opening set before Daniel saved a series of break points to get back in the match. Nadal broke again with the score at 5-2 to seal the set. A short rain break delayed the game in the second set but Nadal broke to lead 4-2 when the players returned, before closing out the set. When asked whether Sunday's victory in Paris was still on his mind, Nadal told the official ATP Tour Web site: "Oh, sure it is still on my mind because it was emotional moment for me. "I'm happy to be playing on grass another time, because for me I enjoy [it] a lot because I have to do different things. "For me it is always a challenge to be here and to practice these new things: the serve, the volley, the slice, return more inside than clay. So I enjoy doing this transition. After Wimbledon, I'm going to have time to enjoy the victory of Roland Garros and to enjoy Majorca." Nadal will now meet Uzbekistani Denis Istomin after he beat Dustin Brown, from Jamaica, 7-6 6-4. Second seed Novak Djokovic also enjoyed a comfortable straight sets win over Italian Paolo Lorenzi. The Serb won 6-3 6-3 in just 73 minutes. Elsewhere, eighth seed Feliciano Lopez beat Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov 6-2 6-4, while ninth seed Julien Benneteau, from France, edged past South African Kevin Anderson 7-5 6-3.

chatgpt: After months of waiting, Rafael Nadal made his first appearance on grass in the 2010 season as he took on Brazilian Marcos Daniel in the second round of the Wimbledon tournament. The world number one, who had won the French Open just a few weeks earlier, was looking to add another Grand Slam title to his collection. Nadal started the match off strong, breaking Daniel's serve in the first game. From there, he dominated the first set, taking it comfortably 6-2. The second set followed much the same pattern as Nadal continued to apply pressure to his opponent, eventually winning 6-2. With this victory, Nadal had not only secured his place in the third round of the tournament but had also extended his winning streak to 23 matches. This included an impressive run of success on clay leading up to his triumph at the French Open. After the match, Nadal expressed his satisfaction with his performance, especially given that grass is not his strongest surface. "I played well today," he said. "It's always tough playing on grass, but I felt comfortable out there." Meanwhile, Daniel had no complaints about his defeat, acknowledging that Nadal was simply too good on the day. "He's a great player," the Brazilian said. "I tried my best, but he was just too strong." Nadal's triumph at Wimbledon that year was just one of many highlights in an outstanding career that has seen him establish himself as one of the all-time greats of men's tennis. As fans look forward to the 2021 Wimbledon tournament, they will no doubt be wondering whether Nadal can add another title to his collection and continue his dominance of the sport.
