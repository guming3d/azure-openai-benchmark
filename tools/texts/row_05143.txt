The animal was seen running at full speed, as people ran for cover to save themselves from the potentially dangerous animal.

Videos of the bear charging through the streets went viral on social media, and people expressed their shock and concern for both the animal and the people of Vologda. The incident has raised questions about the safety measures taken by circuses when touring with animals. Animal welfare activists have pointed out that circuses can be a potentially harmful environment for animals, as they are often subjected to inhumane treatment and unnatural living conditions. While circuses claim to provide a source of entertainment for people, the safety of both animals and humans should be the top priority. It is important that proper safety measures are put in place by circuses to ensure that incidents such as this one do not occur in the future. The incident in Vologda has also reignited the debate about the use of animals for entertainment purposes. Many people believe that it is cruel to use animals in circuses, especially when there are other forms of entertainment available that do not involve the exploitation of animals. The circus industry has faced criticism for years over the treatment of animals in their shows. Many countries have recently implemented bans on the use of animals in circuses, as they are not considered ethical or humane. It remains to be seen whether Russia will follow suit. In the aftermath of the incident in Vologda, many people have called for a comprehensive review of animal welfare laws in Russia. The country has been criticized for its lax animal welfare laws in the past, and it is now time for the government to take action to ensure that animals in circuses and other industries are treated with respect and dignity. In conclusion, the incident in Vologda has exposed the dark side of the circus industry, and raised questions about the treatment of animals used for entertainment purposes. It is important that proper safety measures are put in place to prevent incidents such as this in the future. The government must also take action to strengthen animal welfare laws to protect animals from mistreatment and exploitation.
