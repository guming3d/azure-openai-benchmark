article: Christmas is seen by most families as a time to celebrate together – but for some it seems that only holds true until there is a better offer. The majority of workers would choose a small cash bonus over a couple of extra days off with their loved ones during the festive period, according to research. Accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers asked 2,400 adults what they would value most at Christmas. The most popular option was a £250 cash bonus, with 57 per cent of the vote. Scroll down for video . The majority of workers would choose a small cash bonus over a couple of extra days off with their loved ones during the festive period, according to research . Just one in ten people opted for two extra days of annual leave. The same proportion chose a £250 voucher from their favourite shop. Only 4 per cent would take the offer of a £10,000 bar tab for their closest ten colleagues, 5 per cent would prefer a tablet computer and 4 per cent opted for a Christmas hamper worth £250. Despite Christmas traditionally being a time of giving, only 2 per cent picked the generous option of donating £250 to charity. A further 2 per cent chose a free dinner and drinks for them and three others. Experts offered a charitable explanation for the findings. They argued that the results show many people are struggling financially this Christmas – rather than wanting to escape their in-laws. John Harding, employment partner at PwC, said: ‘Despite the recent signs of a pick-up in wage growth, many people are still feeling the squeeze so it isn’t surprising that people are hoping for an extra cash bonus in their stocking this year.’ He added: ‘Our research highlights that cash is still king this Christmas as employees overwhelmingly place a higher value on a small amount of extra pay above all benefits – even extra time off with their families at Christmas.’ Workers have endured an unprecedented squeeze on finances triggered by the economic crisis, as wage rises failed to keep pace with inflation. But there are signs this could be coming to an end. Official figures released last week show regular pay grew 1.6 per cent in the year to October, while inflation fell to 1 per cent – its lowest level for 12 years. Senior City workers can afford to splash out this Christmas as they look forward to average bonuses of £124,680. Their windfalls are predicted to rise by more than a fifth on last year’s average of £102,940, despite pressure from regulators. It means the typical bonus will be more than four times the average UK salary, according to recruitment firm Astbury Marsden.

chatgpt: A new survey conducted on 2,400 workers in the UK has revealed what employees value most during the Christmas season. The study highlighted that employees would prefer a cash bonus over any other gift option. According to the survey, an impressive 57% of those surveyed stated that they would prefer a £250 cash bonus over other forms of compensation. Christmas is always an expensive time of year, and this cash boost will be a welcome relief for many workers. It will also enable them to indulge in Christmas shopping for themselves and their loved ones. Surprisingly, only one in ten of those surveyed would like to receive two extra days of annual leave as their Christmas gift. This information shows that workers value the monetary aspects of their job the most at this time of year. It could also be a reflection of our busy daily lives, which reduce our available time to take advantage of annual leave days. Charitable donations were also surveyed among workers, with only 2% of workers choosing to donate £250 to charity. It is an excellent gesture to give back to society, but this survey indicates that the majority of employees prefer a tangible gift that they can enjoy or use themselves. The survey also revealed a gender gap in preference between cash and gifts. Of the women surveyed, 53% preferred cash over gifts, whilst 60% of men preferred cash. This difference in preference may reflect the fact that women often receive more gifts than men, thereby reducing their desire for more. The survey had a sample size of 2,400 workers and was conducted across the UK. It revealed a clear insight into what workers value most during the Christmas season. The study results also show that employers should consider cash bonuses as the most popular gift option this Christmas season. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, many workers have been experiencing financial difficulties that make a financial boost an especially welcome gift. In conclusion, the survey confirms that employees value cash bonuses over other forms of compensation, such as annual leave or charitable donations. Employers should take this into consideration when planning their Christmas gift-giving strategies. The findings highlight the importance of listening to employees and understanding their priorities during the festive season. By understanding employee preferences, companies can boost morale and help employees feel valued and appreciated.
