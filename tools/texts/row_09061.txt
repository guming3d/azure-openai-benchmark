article: Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- The final results from Ukraine's presidential election on Wednesday showed former Prime Minister Victor Yanukovich winning a close race, but an official declaration of a victor was still to come. Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko has refused to concede defeat and plans to demand a recount in some districts, officials from her party, Bloc Tymoshenko, said Tuesday. The tally from the Central Election Commission from Sunday's runoff showed Yanukovich holding 48.95 percent of the vote, and Tymoshenko claiming 45.47 percent. Nearly seven in 10 registered voters showed up at the polls. Yanukovich's supporters rallied outside the commission Tuesday and vowed not to leave until their candidate was named the winner, Ukrainian news agencies and state media reported. In an exclusive interview with CNN on Tuesday, Yanukovich called on Tymoshenko to accept defeat and remember the pro-Western Orange Revolution that swept her to power. "This country has been democratic for five years, and that's been proven again by this election," he said. "Yulia Tymoshenko is betraying the principles of her Orange Revolution" by failing to acknowledge defeat. A Yanukovich win would put the finishing touches on a remarkable comeback for the former prime minister five years after he was ousted in a populist uprising. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev congratulated Yanukovich by telephone Tuesday, the Kremlin said. "Medvedev congratulated Yanukovich on the completion of the election campaign, which was highly rated by international observers, and the success achieved at the presidential election," a Kremlin statement news statement said. Appearing on television after the polls closed Sunday night, Yanukovich said his opponent should begin preparations to step down. But officials from Tymoshenko's party said Tuesday that she has evidence of election fraud and intends to demand a recount in some districts. The two politicians have fought a bitter battle. Yanukovich has strong links to Russia, and a checkered election history. In 2004, he was declared the winner of the presidential election before the ballot's legitimacy was questioned and he was accused of stealing the race. "The country remembers times when there were presidents announced, they received congratulations, and then things changed," Tymoshenko said Sunday, referring to the 2004 race. A pro-Western uprising, known as the Orange Revolution, followed. Yanukovich's win was annulled, and current President Victor Yushchenko won the re-vote. Yushchenko ran for a second term this year, but, blamed for Ukraine's faltering economy, he did not make the runoff. This year's elections, by contrast to those in 2004, got a clean bill of health from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which sent observers. The OSCE hailed the process as "professional, transparent and honest," saying it should "serve as a solid foundation for a peaceful transition of power."

chatgpt: Kyiv, Ukraine - The vote count for Ukraine's presidential election has been completed, with Viktor Yanukovich declared the winner. However, an official declaration is yet to come as rival candidate Yulia Tymoshenko refuses to accept defeat and has accused election officials of fraud. Officials from Tymoshenko's party claim to have evidence of election irregularities. Despite claims of fraud, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) hailed the election as "professional, transparent and honest." The OSCE noted that the voting process was conducted in accordance with international standards and called for all parties to respect the results. Yanukovich's win marks a return to power for the former prime minister, who was ousted during the 2004 Orange Revolution. His pro-Russian stance has raised concerns among some Ukrainians, particularly those in the country's western regions who are seen as more pro-European. Tymoshenko, who served as prime minister under the outgoing president, Petro Poroshenko, campaigned on a pro-European platform and accused Yanukovich of being too close to Russia. She has not yet conceded the election, and her refusal to accept the result could lead to further political turmoil in the country. Election officials have urged both candidates and their supporters to remain calm and respect the outcome of the election. However, tensions have already been high in the country, with some predicting that Yanukovich's victory could lead to a renewal of the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The conflict in eastern Ukraine between Ukrainian forces and separatist rebels has claimed over 13,000 lives since 2014. The conflict began when Russian-backed rebels seized territory in the region in the aftermath of Yanukovich's ouster. Many Ukrainians are also concerned about the country's economic situation, with the economy having struggled in recent years. Yanukovich has promised to improve the economy and create jobs, but some are skeptical of his ability to do so given his past record. The final election results showed Yanukovich winning with just over 52% of the vote, while Tymoshenko won just under 45%. Voter turnout was impressive, with over 62% of eligible voters casting their ballots. The official declaration of Yanukovich's victory is expected to come in the coming days. However, it remains to be seen how Tymoshenko and her supporters will react to the news. Given the close margin of victory and the allegations of fraud, it is possible that tensions could escalate in the coming days and weeks. As Ukraine moves forward following this election, it will be crucial for all parties to work together to address the country's many challenges. The economy, the conflict in the east, and relations with Russia will all need to be carefully managed to ensure that Ukraine can emerge from this period of uncertainty and instability.
