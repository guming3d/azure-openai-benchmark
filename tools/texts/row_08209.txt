chatgpt: Former Manchester United star, Ryan Giggs, has had his 4x4 stolen from his driveway in Oldham, Greater Manchester. The 47-year old veteran left his Land Rover running on his driveway when the theft occurred. Police have confirmed that they are investigating the incident, which occurred on Saturday evening. The vehicle was reportedly driven away from Giggs' property on Broadway, Chadderton, at around 7:45 PM. The thieves are believed to have accessed the vehicle using the keyless entry system. A spokesperson for Greater Manchester Police commented on the matter, saying, "Police were called at around 7.45 pm on 27 March 2021 to a report of a stolen vehicle on Broadway, Chadderton. Enquiries are ongoing." Giggs, who is currently the manager of the Welsh national football team, has not commented on the matter. However, it is believed that the incident has left him shaken and concerned about the safety of his family. The theft of vehicles using keyless entry systems has become increasingly common in recent years. Criminals can use electronic devices to intercept signals from a vehicle's key fob, allowing them to unlock the vehicle and drive away without needing the key itself. In response to the issue, police have advised vehicle owners to take extra precautions when protecting their vehicles. This includes ensuring that their key fobs are kept in a signal-blocking pouch or box when not in use, and parking their vehicles in secure, well-lit areas. This is not the first time that Giggs has encountered trouble with his vehicles. In 2011, he crashed his Audi Q7 into a stationary car near Manchester city centre. He initially fled the scene before returning to speak with police. He was subsequently charged with driving without due care and attention and fined £1,350. Despite this incident, Giggs remains an icon in Manchester United's history. He is the club's most decorated player, having won 34 major trophies during his career, including 13 Premier League titles, four FA Cups, and two Champions Leagues. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time. The investigation into the theft of Giggs' Land Rover is ongoing, and police have appealed to anyone with information to come forward.
