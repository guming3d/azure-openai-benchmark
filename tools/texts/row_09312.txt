It looks as though a lumberjack got halfway through chopping down this tree and just gave up. But in fact the damage to this German birch has been caused by beavers. The large, flat-tailed, semi-aquatic rodents are more usually associated with North America after the European variety was practically hunted to extinction. Timber! A birch gnawed by beavers stands near Lengenwang, in Bavaria, southern Germany. The animals, once hunted to near extinction in Europe, have been reintroduced to the area . In Germany since 1979, however, there has been a programme to reintroduce the animals - resulting in the horrendous damage to this birch in Bavaria's Legenwang municipality. The animals like to snack on the bark of trees - particularly birch - resulting in this 'ringing' effect as they chew all the way around the trunk as high as they can reach. But although these pictures might suggest otherwise, beavers are in fact good for woodland habitats, even trees. Often regarded as nature's engineers, Beavers are known for building dams on rivers and streams, and building their homes - known as 'lodges' - in the resulting pond.

Beaver's constructions also act as the 'earth's kidneys' to purify water because silt collects upstream of older beaver dams, and toxic chemicals, such as pesticides, are broken down by microbes in the wetlands created. That means that water downstream of dams is cleaner and needs less treatment for human use.

Populations of Eurasian beaver are recovering, aided by conservation efforts, after the species was nearly hunted to extinction in Europe for its fur and for scent gland secretions once believed to have healing qualities. Because of these pressures, the beaver became extinct in Great Britain in the sixteenth century. However, several thousand now live on the Elbe, the Rhone and in parts of Scandinavia, and they have been reintroduced in Scotland, Bavaria, Austria, Netherlands, Serbia, Denmark and Bulgaria.

chatgpt: The beaver, one of the largest rodents in the world, was nearly hunted to extinction in Europe for its highly-prized fur. However, new efforts are being made to reintroduce the species to the continent, with positive results for both the ecosystem and animal welfare. In the German region of Bavaria, beavers were successfully reintroduced to the wild in the early 2000s after being absent for nearly 200 years. While the beavers quickly adapted to their new home, their presence has not been without controversy. Recently, a tree on the banks of the River Isar was found to have been felled by a beaver. While the damage caused concern for local officials, experts say it is simply part of the beavers' natural behavior. Beavers are known for their extraordinary construction skills, building dams and lodges that provide essential habitats for other creatures in woodland areas. Reintroduction efforts are also taking place in the United Kingdom, where beavers were hunted to extinction in the 16th century. In 2009, a group of beavers were released into the wild at Knapdale Forest in Scotland in a government-sponsored trial. The beavers reportedly adapted quickly to their new environment and have been observed building structures that create new habitats for other wildlife. Beavers are an important part of the ecosystem, and their reintroduction is seen by many as a positive step for conservation efforts. In addition to providing habitats for other animals, beavers also help to prevent flooding by creating dams that slow down the flow of water. In areas where beavers have been reintroduced, their impact on the ecosystem is often visible within weeks or months. Researchers have observed increased biodiversity, with the creation of new wetland habitats attracting a wide variety of species. The benefits of these habitats are often felt far beyond the immediate area, as the increased biodiversity can help to stabilize entire ecosystems. Despite the clear benefits of reintroducing beavers to the wild, their presence can still cause issues for humans. In Bavaria, farmers have complained about the beavers damaging crops and cutting down trees. In the UK, there have been concerns about their impact on salmon populations and the risk of spreading diseases to other animals. Efforts are being made to balance the needs of humans and beavers, with some areas using techniques such as tree guards and beaver-proof fences to protect crops and prevent damage. Education campaigns are also underway to help people understand the importance of beavers in the ecosystem and to reduce conflicts between humans and the animals. In conclusion, the reintroduction of beavers to Europe is a promising development for conservation efforts. Their extraordinary building skills and role in creating habitats for other animals make them an essential part of many ecosystems. While challenges remain in balancing the needs of humans and beavers, the benefits of the species' reintroduction are clear, and ongoing efforts to protect them are sure to pay dividends over time.
