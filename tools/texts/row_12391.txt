article: By . Ian Drury . PUBLISHED: . 20:36 EST, 31 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 20:38 EST, 31 January 2014 . Up to 50 troops are living at a £100-a-night hotel at taxpayers’ expense because there are not enough beds at their barracks. Around 20 Royal Marines and 30 Royal Navy personnel have been booked into the three-star Holiday Inn in Plymouth, four miles from the Devonport naval base. The hotel, near the city centre, has a restaurant, sauna, steam room, gym and satellite television. Members of the group are each receiving £25 food vouchers a day and have boasted of dining ‘on fillet steak every night’. Lucky manoeuvre: Around 50 troops, including marines like those pictured, are being housed in the Plymouth Holiday Inn . The revelation provoked anger as the Ministry of Defence has pushed through crippling military cuts, including axing 30,000 troops, fighter jets and warships, in a bid to save around £43billion. It also emerged as Prime Minister David Cameron defended the belt-tightening during an appearance before a Parliamentary committee. The MoD yesterday insisted that it was 'extremely rare' to put up troops in hotels. The story came to light after three Royal Marines enjoying a sauna at the Holiday Inn told another guest of the situation. According to the men they had been placed at the hotel 'indefinitely'. The man said: 'They seemed to be enjoying themselves. They told me some of them were going to Nando's every night. Better than the barracks: The servicemen are staying at the Plymouth Holiday Inn, just four miles from their base . Lap of luxury: The marines, who are given a £25 food voucher every day, boasted of eating fillet steak every night . 'But in a time of defence cutbacks sticking 50 troops in a hotel seems like madness. 'It must be costing so much money to put them up there. The hotel is three star and they said they're getting a £25 food vouchers a day. 'It seems crazy they're in a hotel just four miles away from the barracks just because the military can't get their act together.' Defence sources insisted the MoD had negotiated a special discount rate for the rooms of about £50 a night. The situation is expected to last 'a few days', they said. Insiders said there were not enough beds at barracks because there had been an influx of troops passing through Devonport. An MoD spokesman said: 'Due to a slight increase in the requirement for accommodation in Plymouth we can confirm that a limited number of Navy personnel are staying at a local hotel. 'We can be clear that this is only a temporary arrangement to ensure their duties can be carried out and a special rate was secured to ensure the best value for money for the taxpayer.'

chatgpt: Around 20 marines and 30 Navy personnel have been booked in at a hotel in Plymouth, located just four miles from the nearest naval base. The hotel offered all the necessary amenities for the soldiers to relax and recuperate after a long day of strenuous training. With a restaurant, sauna, steam room, gym, and satellite TV, the military personnel found comfort and ease at their temporary home. However, the soldiers' indulgence came to light when reports surfaced that they were boasting about dining nightly on fillet steak with their £25 food vouchers. This revelation led to an investigation by the Ministry of Defence, causing alarm and scrutiny in the UK's military circles. Sources reveal that the Ministry of Defence launched an inquiry after several whistleblowers reported concerns about the behaviour of military personnel staying at the hotel in question. The whistleblowers highlighted the visible excesses they witnessed at the hotel, including frequent trips to bars, inappropriate behaviour, and boasting of their expensive meals. The Ministry of Defence confirmed the investigation saying that they take allegations of this nature seriously and that a full and comprehensive inquiry will be conducted. The ministry stated that it would not be appropriate to comment further until the investigation is complete. The situation has caused outrage, particularly among taxpayers who have questioned whether the soldiers' behaviour aligns with the ethos of the UK military. Some have suggested that the soldiers' lavish lifestyles could contribute to negative perceptions of the military and undermine its high standards. According to sources, meals and other services at the hotel are paid for by a partner company of the Ministry of Defence. However, the allegations suggest that there may be a lack of oversight or accountability for how the funds are used. It is unclear at this time if any financial irregularities or inappropriate behaviour existed. The hotel in question has not released any statements on the matter. However, sources indicate that the management has cooperated fully with the Ministry of Defence's investigation. This incident has reinforced the importance of accountability and transparency within the UK military. In recent years, the UK has been a leader in implementing reforms aimed at promoting ethical behaviour, ensuring high standards, and preventing corruption. The public will be closely watching the results of the investigation, and the military's response will be critical in ensuring trust in the UK military remains undiminished. Whether or not the soldiers' actions were justified remains to be seen; however, the UK military prides itself on high standards, and any violation should be dealt with appropriately to maintain its enduring reputation.
