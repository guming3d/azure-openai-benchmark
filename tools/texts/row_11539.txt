article: (CNN) -- Authorities are no longer able to watch a video of scenes at a Georgia nightclub in the case of Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger because a digital video recorder system recorded over it, an attorney said Thursday. Roethlisberger, who has been the starting quarterback for the Steelers for six seasons, has been accused of sexually assaulting a 20-year-old woman at a Georgia nightspot this month. He has not been charged. Roethlisberger's attorney has said, "The facts show that there was no criminal activity." Police were hoping to use the recording to glean any details and insights about the sequence of events surrounding the alleged incident, which was said to have occurred in a restroom. Carl Cansino, the attorney representing the Capital City nightclub, said police were able to see a small portion of the recording, and the club manager said he saw the entire video. Cansino said the club manager said the club's dance floor and entrance were in the recording during the night of the alleged assault, but he couldn't discern anything out of the ordinary. Police talked to Roethlisberger, 28, and the woman at the scene immediately after the incident was reported about 2:30 a.m. March 5 at the club in Milledgeville, Georgia, said Deputy Police Chief Richard Malone. The woman "alleged that he is the perpetrator," Malone told reporters. Attorney Lee Parks said the woman said she is "fully cooperating with law enforcement." The Georgia Bureau of Investigation said the investigation is continuing and the file will be turned over to the local district attorney when it is over. "There is a future interview scheduled at present, and she intends to keep that appointment," Parks said. CNN's Carolina Sanchez contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback, Ben Roethlisberger, is facing accusations of sexual assault from a woman who claims he assaulted her in a Georgia nightclub. Roethlisberger has vehemently denied these allegations through his attorney, Ed Garland, who claims that "The facts show that there was no criminal activity."  Garland has also reported that the earlier request for Roethlisberger's DNA, that was made in connection with the case, has now been dropped. However, the case is still ongoing, and new details are emerging. The latest news from the case is that the nightclub's digital video recorder (DVR) may have recorded over any potential evidence that could have been helpful in the investigation.  In a statement to the press, Garland said, "We have been informed that the DVR recording systems were operating that night, but the relevant footage no longer exists. It appears that the DVR recorded over the relevant time period, so there is no video of what transpired."  Despite lacking physical evidence, the case remains very much in the spotlight, with many people wondering about the credibility of the accuser's claim. After all, Ben Roethlisberger is no stranger to controversy. In 2010, he was accused of sexual assault by a college student, but the case was later dropped due to lack of evidence.  This latest allegation is being taken very seriously, and the NFL has already launched its own investigation into the matter. NFL Commissioner, Roger Goodell, has a zero-tolerance policy towards any type of harassment or abuse, and the league has made it clear that they will not hesitate to take appropriate action if need be.  In the meantime, Ben Roethlisberger and his attorney are maintaining that the quarterback did not commit any wrongdoing. However, as the case continues to unfold, only time will tell what the ultimate outcome will be. For now, all eyes are on Georgia as the investigation into this highly controversial issue continues.
