A British man died in Thailand after getting high on cocaine then running into a plate glass door, local police said. Police found Jason Flannery, 25, a talented former schoolboy athlete from North Yorkshire, dead in a sixth floor flat in Pattaya, a city popular with tourists, at 3am. His face and chest were covered in cuts, police told local media. It is believed that he bled to death after severing an artery in his neck. Mr Flannery's girlfriend, Janjira Buapae, 23, told police that she returned from work to their flat in the Spanish Place Pattay apartment complex to find Jason in what local media described as 'a serious discussion' with a friend and another woman. Later, she said, Mr Flannery mixed cocaine with water and drank it, before smoking a spliff. Ms Janjira said she rowed with her boyfriend and decided to leave the room. Mr Flannery pursued her into the hallway, according to reports, where their argument drew a crowd of onlookers. Ms Janjira claimed Mr Flannery, alarmed by the crowd, ran back in to his flat and straight into a glass door. He fell down and died soon afterwards. Sawang Boriboon rescue volunteers, Pattaya Police and Bang Lamung Hospital medics were called to the flat but Mr Flannery had already died from his wounds. Mr Flannery, originally from Leyburn, North Yorkshire, was a former pupil at Wensleydale School, where he had won plaudits for his athleticism. As a teenager he won the Yorkshire County AAA 1500m title, scored a hat-trick in five minutes with Richmond Town FC juniors team to secure the Cleveland Challenge Cup and was awarded the John Bowles Cup by his school for outstanding achievement in sport.

chatgpt: A young man has died after severing an artery, likely due to drug use, according to reports. Jason Flannery, aged 25, was found dead in a flat in the town centre of Woking, Surrey, last Tuesday. His girlfriend, Janjira Buapae, reported that he had been using cocaine and smoking cannabis prior to his death. It is understood that the police are not investigating Mr Flannery's death as a suspicious incident. Although the exact circumstances of his death remain unclear as investigations are still ongoing, the authorities believe that it may have been caused by Mr Flannery’s drug use. "It's always tragic when someone dies, particularly in circumstances such as this," said Detective Superintendent John Hamlin. "Our thoughts are with Mr Flannery's family and loved ones at this difficult time." According to experts, cocaine and cannabis are both drugs that can cause serious harm and even death. Cocaine use can lead to asthma, heart attacks, cerebral haemorrhage, and even sudden death. Cannabis use, especially when mixed with other harmful substances, can cause a range of negative health effects, including psychosis and stroke. Drug abuse is a serious issue, particularly among the younger generation, who are often lured into using drugs due to peer pressure and social media influence. In recent years, there has been a surge in the number of young people who have died due to drug overdose, prompting calls for greater education and awareness about the dangers of drug use. In Mr Flannery's case, it appears that a combination of factors may have contributed to his untimely death. However, his girlfriend has urged others to learn from his mistake and to seek help if they are struggling with addiction. "I loved Jason very much, but he made a mistake that cost him his life," Ms Buapae said. "I hope that others will see what happened to him and realise the dangers of drugs. It's never too late to ask for help." Mr Flannery's death is a tragic reminder of the need for individuals to be aware of the dangers of drug use and to seek help if they suspect that they or someone they know is struggling with addiction. The authorities will continue to investigate the matter, but in the meantime, it is important for individuals to take responsibility for their health and wellbeing, and to avoid exposure to harmful substances.
