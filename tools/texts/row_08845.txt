Scientists have created a new type of material that can be used to create curved smartphone screens that allows pictures and words to be displayed round corners. The lightweight and durable C-Axis Aligned Crystal (CAAC) material means there is no longer any need for wasted space on phone screens. The prototypes, created by a Japanese company, even allow rolling information to run down the sides of a smartphone. The lightweight and durable C-Axis Aligned Crystal (CAAC) material was used to create this prototype smartphone, which has icons down its sides and allows images to 'spill' round its corners. It also allows for rolling text down its sides (pictured right) Semiconductor Energy Laboratory (SEL) showed off its new technology at the FPD 2013 electronics trade show in Japan. Many people have predicted that phones of the future will have curved screens and the crystal-based material means that it is possible to make side-roll and top-roll OLED displays that allow pictures and words to 'spill over' the phone's edges. The CAAC material is less than 100 microns thick and is currently the 'only technology that can display a picture on bent edges,' according to SEL.

A message alert is displayed on the top curve of the phone (pictured left) while the home button is conveniently located on the side of the handset (pictured right) Amazingly, the company says that bending the material has no effect on the picture quality of the prototype and it believes it will be used to create the next generation of wearable devices, Diginfo.com reported. The company has developed bendable lithium ion batteries to go with its bendable new material, allowing for a sleek watch-like prototype device. In a test where the battery was . repeatedly bent with the wear-and-tear expected in a wrist device, it could . be put on and taken off over 10,000 times. SEL believes CAAC will be used to create the next generation of wearable devices. The company has developed bendable lithium ion batteries to go with its bendable new material, allowing for a sleek watch-like prototype device to be developed (pictured) SEL has also created the largest plastic substrate OLED display, which measures 13.5 inches and a resolution of 326 PPI. Yoshitake Yamamoto, from SEL, said the CAAC material is very reliable and allows for high resolution to be achieved in large displays. 'One feature of CAAC is, it doesn't break easily, because the crystals are continuously aligned. So, it isn't damaged much even if it's bent...this is the only technology that can display a picture on bent edges,' he said.

chatgpt: Japanese electronics company SEL has unveiled their latest prototype smartphone featuring state-of-the-art technology. This device has been designed using an innovative material known as C-Axis Aligned Crystal (CAAC) which is not only lightweight but also boasts of unique features. Unlike traditional smartphones, the CAAC prototype has the ability to bend without distorting the picture resolution, which in turn opens up a new horizon of possibilities for smartphone users. CAAC technology also enables the photos to curve around the handset, making it one of the most visually appealing devices in the market. One of the most impressive features of this prototype smartphone is the rolling text which can be displayed down its sides. Users can now read their text messages or scrolling news headlines as they move down the sides of their device, without having to open up an app or switch between different screens. Another interesting feature is its durability. The CAAC material is resistant to both impacts and scratches, making it an ideal option for those who lead an active lifestyle or are rough with their electronic devices. Therefore, this device is expected to have a longer lifespan than the average smartphone. SEH has revealed that this prototype has been created to showcase its next-gen technology, thereby providing a glimpse into the future of smartphones. The CAAC material is expected to revolutionize the manufacturing of smartphones, opening up new doors of innovation and possibilities. With the rise of smartphone technology, companies are increasingly seeking to gain a competitive edge by offering new and unique features. This prototype smartphone is an example of how companies are striving to develop cutting-edge technologies that offer consumers a better user experience. Given its features, analysts have claimed that the CAAC prototype could potentially become the new standard for smartphone manufacturing. The material's ability to bend without distorting picture quality and also being resistant to impact and scratches make it an ideal choice for future smartphone models. As for the release date and pricing of the CAAC prototype, SEL has not revealed any specifics yet. However, experts predict that this device will be priced at a premium cost due to both its unique features and its innovative material. In summary, the CAAC prototype smartphone designed by SEL has introduced a new standard of smartphone manufacturing. Its ability to bend without distorting picture resolution, rolling text, and unmatched durability are set to be the trendsetters for future smartphone models.
