article: New Delhi (CNN) -- India's famed yoga guru, Baba Ramdev, ended his hunger strike Tuesday, a day after he was briefly detained at a New Delhi stadium for protesting alleged government corruption. Ramdev's anti-corruption fast started on August 9 and ended Tuesday at the same stadium where he had been detained. The end to the fast was televised as many watched the bearded yoga teacher sip what appeared to be lemon juice. Ramdev, whose yoga television programs have been watched by millions, is seeking repatriation of Indian money he says is stashed in foreign banks. He has also criticized the ruling Congress party, blaming it for chronic graft. On Monday, police briefly detained Ramdev after he tried to lead an anti-corruption march toward the national parliament building, police said. He was transported to the stadium, where he was detained for hours. Ramdev and his supporters stayed overnight at the venue despite being released. He ended his protest fast and left the stadium with his supporters Tuesday after police told him to leave because of security concerns ahead of India's Independence Day on Wednesday. During the protest Monday, several senior politicians from the opposition Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance joined Ramdev. Ramdev also voiced a stinging assessment of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for his handling of corruption allegations. A government official offered his own criticism. "Ramdev has lost his identity as a fighter. He has now succumbed to the pressure of (the) BJP and also the NDA partners. There is no doubt about it. To that extent he has completely lost his credibility," federal minister M. Veerappa Moily told reporters Tuesday.

chatgpt: Yoga guru Baba Ramdev was released after a short detention by Indian police on Monday. The police detained him during an attempt to march on the Indian parliament building. The yoga guru was advocating for the repatriation of illegal wealth held overseas and for stronger corruption protections in India. Baba Ramdev has been a vocal critic of corruption in India and has been advocating for change in various ways. With his popularity and influence, Ramdev aims to promote a corruption-free society. Ramdev's detention sparked protests among his supporters, who were gathered to show solidarity with the guru. They criticized the police for arresting the yoga guru, who they believe was fighting for their cause. The police, on their part, said that they had to detain Ramdev to maintain law and order during the protest. However, they later released him after questioning. Ramdev is not the first activist to protest against corruption in India. Many have taken to the streets to demand change in the country's political system. Corruption is a major problem in India, with millions of people being affected by it in one way or another. The Indian government has taken several steps to curb corruption, but many believe that more needs to be done. There is also a growing demand for repatriation of illegal wealth held overseas, which is believed to be a major source of corruption in India. As Baba Ramdev continues his fight against corruption and for the repatriation of illegal wealth, his supporters hope that his message will resonate with the government and the public at large. The road ahead is long and challenging, but with the support of the people, change can be brought about in India.
