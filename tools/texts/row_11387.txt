chatgpt: A man in his thirties fell 12ft from a window after a candle is believed to have ignited a curtain, causing a blaze in a Cambridge flat. The incident occurred on Tuesday evening and firefighters were called to the scene just after 10pm. The man, who has yet to be named, suffered injuries and was rushed to a nearby hospital.  Cambridge Fire and Rescue Service has urged the public to take extra precautions in the wake of the accident, reminding everyone to make sure that all candles are placed on a secure and stable surface and to never leave candles unattended. Authorities also advised that people should always keep candles away from materials that may easily catch fire, such as curtains and bedding.  In other news, the Royal British Legion invited the entire nation to turn off all lights except for one as a poignant commemoration for the centenary of Britain entering the First World War. Specifically, everyone was asked to light a single candle in honor of those who gave their lives in battle. The tribute was a symbolic act of remembrance for those who fought and died during one of the deadliest conflicts in human history.  The campaign, titled "Lights Out," was a call to reflect on the sacrifices made by the soldiers who fought in World War I. The Legion's message was simple: to turn off every light in your home, leaving on just a solitary candle. This was an invitation to the entire nation to come together in a moment of silence and pay tribute to the fallen soldiers who never made it back home.  The campaign involved key figures such as Prince William, who lit a candle in Belgium on the eve of the anniversary. In the UK, the Houses of Parliament and other landmarks, including Blackpool Tower and the Eden Project, turned off their lights as a mark of respect. Even the Prime Minister, David Cameron, participated, lighting a candle in his official residence at Downing Street. As the nation united in remembrance of the servicemen who fought in World War I, the "Lights Out" campaign demonstrated the power of a collective tribute. It served as a modern-day reminder of the sacrifices made by so many in the past and inspired people from all walks of life to pause, reflect, and commemorate the events that took place over a century ago.  In conclusion, the tragedy in Cambridge emphasises the dangers of fire caused by candles and highlights the importance of safety measures to prevent incidents like these from occurring. It also reminds us of the importance of remembering the sacrifices made by those who fought and died during World War I. By uniting under the "Lights Out" campaign, the nation was able to pay a powerful tribute to the brave servicemen who gave their lives in defense of their country.
