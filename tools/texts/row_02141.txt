article: (CNN) -- Saudi Arabia this week turned back more than 1,000 Nigerian women pilgrims who were not accompanied by male guardians or "mahram." Saudi's Ministry of Pilgrimage (Hajj) released a statement on Friday defending its decision, saying that it will "not allow the entry ... of those who don't comply with terms and requirements of the entry visa to Saudi Arabia to perform the Hajj." Saudi law requires each female pilgrim under the age of 45 years to have a male sponsor during the pilgrimage journey, regardless of nationality. "This rule is applied to all women in general who want to get an entry visa to Saudi Arabia to perform Hajj," pilgrimage ministry spokesman Hatim bin Hassan Qadhi said in the statement. So far, there has been no official explanation from Nigerian authorities on what might have happened. The last of the women arrived Friday night in Kano, Nigeria, after being stranded for four to five days at Jeddah's King Abdulaziz International Airport, Nigeria's state-run News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported, quoting several women. "This is the most dehumanizing situation I have ever experienced in my life," one arriving female, who did not want to be named, told NAN. Another woman, Binta Malami, said she traveled with her husband but was denied entry to Saudi Arabia because her husband's name did not correspond to the name written in her passport, the news agency said. Her husband decided to return with his wife in protest of an "inhumane" treatment. Saudi authorities denied any ill treatment. The Ministry of Hajj stressed in its statement that the Saudi government is keen "on receiving the pilgrims from all over the world with ease and comfort in accordance with the applicable instructions." Most international pilgrims arrive in Jeddah via air or sea, then make their way to the nearby mountainous city of Mecca to perform the Islamic pilgrimage rites. Nigeria started flying its citizens back home on Thursday after sending a delegation, led by speaker of the House of Representatives Alhaji Aminu Tambuwal, to discuss the incident with Saudi officials, NAN reported. Alhaji Hamman-Adama Tukur, one of the Nigerian clerics who helped the stranded women in Jeddah, told NAN that the women were actually accompanied by male escorts, but that the checking system at the Jeddah airport was such that men were checked, cleared and asked to proceed. "When it was the women's turn to be checked and cleared, the security claimed they were not accompanied by their guardians -- mahram -- and were unwilling to listen to any explanation.'' Saudi officials normally separate men and women upon arrival as they check passports and paperwork. Islam requires every Muslim, who is capable physically and financially, to perform Hajj in Mecca, where the Saudi government says it receives almost 3 million pilgrims over a period of about 10 days every year.

chatgpt: Female pilgrims from Nigeria have returned home following their experience in Saudi Arabia during the annual Hajj pilgrimage. Many women have reported feeling "dehumanized" and "disrespected" by Saudi authorities who they claim did not properly accompany them during the religious rituals. Saudi Arabia requires all female pilgrims to be chaperoned by a male guardian, either a relative or a designated guide appointed by the country's hajj ministry. However, many women have reported being left alone during crowded parts of the pilgrimage, such as during the stoning of the devil ritual. One of the pilgrims from Nigeria, Maryam Ibrahim, described her experience as "dehumanizing". She said that she was separated from her husband and children during the hajj and was forced to navigate the crowds alone. "I felt like nobody cared about us," she said. Other women have reported similar experiences of feeling vulnerable and unsupported. Many have taken to social media to express their frustration and disappointment. Some have criticized the Saudi authorities for not doing enough to ensure the safety and wellbeing of female pilgrims. In response to these concerns, Saudi authorities have reiterated their commitment to ensuring that all pilgrims, including women, are properly accompanied and protected during the hajj. The country's hajj ministry has said that it will review its procedures and make any necessary changes to address the concerns of female pilgrims. The annual Hajj pilgrimage is a major event in the Muslim calendar, with millions of people from around the world traveling to Mecca in Saudi Arabia to perform religious rituals. The hajj can be a challenging and physically demanding experience, with long walks, crowded conditions, and limited access to amenities. Despite these challenges, many pilgrims say that the hajj is a life-changing experience that brings them closer to their faith and to their fellow Muslims. However, for female pilgrims, the experience can also be marred by feelings of vulnerability and isolation, as well as concerns about safety and security. As more and more women from across the world make the hajj pilgrimage, it is important for Saudi authorities to ensure that they are properly supported and protected. By listening to the concerns of female pilgrims and making changes to their procedures, the Saudi government can help to ensure that everyone who makes the hajj trip has a safe and meaningful experience.
