Despite his condition, Glatzer has been communicating with his husband and co-director, Wash Westmoreland, through eye movements. The couple plans to watch the Oscars on Sunday from the hospital. Glatzer's condition has put a damper on the excitement surrounding Still Alice, the emotional drama that stars Julianne Moore, who has been nominated for Best Actress. The film tells the story of Alice Howland, a renowned linguistics professor who is diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. It is a poignant and heart-wrenching tale that has struck a chord with audiences and critics alike. Glatzer and Westmoreland worked tirelessly to bring Still Alice to the big screen. The film is based on the best-selling novel by Lisa Genova and was a labor of love for the couple. Despite Glatzer's condition, he remained an active participant in the filmmaking process. Westmoreland has said that they were able to communicate effectively throughout filming, with Glatzer even directing Julianne Moore in one scene through eye movements. Westmoreland has been by Glatzer's side throughout his hospitalization, providing support and updates for friends, family, and fans. He has also expressed his gratitude for the outpouring of love and support that the couple has received.

They have expressed their hope that Still Alice will inspire conversation about the importance of early diagnosis and treatment for Alzheimer's disease.
