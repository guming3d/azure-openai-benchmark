Escape route: Adam Lanza set up an ambush for police with his car in a way that allowed him to flee through the woods . Newtown school shooter Adam Lanza laid out five identical sets of military fatigues in his darkened bedroom and set up an ambush for cops arriving at the school that could have afforded him a chance to flee into the nearby woods, it was revealed today. The new details - gleaned from an in-depth Connecticut State Police investigation - suggest Lanza could have been planning to escape Sandy Hook Elementary School after shooting dead 20 first grade children and six women. Detectives still have not determined what drove Lanza to plan and execute the horrific December 14 attack on the innocent teachers and students. The new information comes from the Hartford Courant, which published a report Friday with exclusive details from the investigation. When Lanza arrived at the school, he parked his mother's Honda sedan in a way that would have allowed him to ambush unsuspecting police officers who were arriving at the scene of the shooting. The passenger side door was facing toward a wall of the school. He leaned a semi-automatic Soviet-style 12-gauge shotgun against the car - presumably to use once police showed up. He took an AR-15 semi-automatic assault rifle and two handguns inside with him. All four of the weapons belonged to his mother. Detectives told the Courant that the car was positioned to give Lanza a straight line of fire toward cars headed toward the school up the property's long driveway. The school and the nearby woods would have been behind him - allowing him cover and, possibly, an escape route. The report also details an eery scene that Lanza left back at the million-dollar mansion where he lived with his mother. Lanza killed 20 children and six women at Sandy Hook Elementary School before taking his own life . In his bedroom, he taped black plastic garbage bags across the windows to block out all sunlight. His bed was crisply made. And he laid out five identical sets of combat fatigues - tan-colored shirts with five pairs of khaki pants. In the nearby computer room, detectives found an empty cereal bowl next to the computer hard drives that Lanza had taken out of his computers and tried to smash with a barbell. Those he didn't smash, he carved a 'W' into. Lanza's mother, who pulled her son out of public school and home-schooled him, was found in her bed. She was shot four times in the head with a .22-caliber rifle. The shots were fired at point-blank, with the muzzle of the gun pressed against her forehead. Detectives say Lanza's online habits - which include numerous postings about guns and other mass shootings - could provide the greatest clues about his motives.

chatgpt: On December 14, 2012, a gunman by the name of Adam Lanza, 20, walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, and carried out a horrific mass shooting. The tragedy resulted in the loss of 26 lives, including 20 children between the ages of six and seven. But what went on in the mind of the perpetrator before he committed these heinous crimes?  New details have emerged about Lanza's preparations before the shooting. According to police reports, Lanza parked his car in such a way that would allow him a clear line of fire for arriving police cars. He left a semi-automatic shotgun leaning against his vehicle, then proceeded to enter the school.  Investigators later found that Lanza had carved a 'W' into both of his computer hard drives and smashed them with a barbell. However, it's not clear what the significance of the letter 'W' holds, or if it has any connection to the tragedy.  But that's not all. Police also uncovered that Lanza had shot his mother, Nancy Lanza, four times in the head with the muzzle of the gun pressed against her forehead. Earlier that day, he had killed her at their home before heading to the school.  The motive behind Lanza's actions remains a mystery to this day. However, investigators have stated that he had an affinity for mass shootings and had studied them extensively. Reports have also linked him to autism spectrum disorder and other mental health issues.  Regardless of what drove Lanza to carry out such a horrific act, the community of Newtown has been forever changed by the events of that day. In the aftermath, many initiatives have been put in place to honor the memory of the victims and support their families. The Sandy Hook Promise was established as a way to prevent gun violence and promote safer communities.  The tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School has been one of the deadliest school shootings in American history. It has sparked a national debate on gun laws, mental health, and the safety of our schools. The events of December 14th, 2012, will not be forgotten, and the lives lost that day will always be remembered.  In conclusion, the details of Adam Lanza's preparations before carrying out the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School only add to the already horrific nature of the tragedy. While we may never fully understand his motives, we must continue to push for measures that will prevent such tragedies from happening again. The legacy of the victims of that day will always live on through the countless efforts made to honor their memory and prevent gun violence from tearing apart any more families.
