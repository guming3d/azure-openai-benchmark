article: One of European football's grandest clubs has a new owner, with an Indonesian billionaire shaking up the established order in Italy's Serie A. Tycoon Erick Thohir is only the second foreign owner in the Italian first division after acquiring a 70% stake in three-time European champions Inter Milan. He has added Inter to what is fast become a comprehensive sporting profile after becoming the first Asian to own a stake in an NBA team as part of a consortium which purchased the Philadelphia 76ers in 2011. Thohir is also one of three partners who own Washington's Major League Soccer franchise DC United and has now followed in the footsteps of the American consortium, led by Thomas DiBenedetto, which broke new ground by purchasing Roma in 2011. Blog: Your country needs YOU! "Today is a truly special day in my life," the 43-year-old Thohir said  in a statement. "I am an entrepreneur, but first of all I am a supporter and a sports lover. I cannot wait to put our passion and international experience at the service of this fantastic club and its supporters." Inter hope the ownership change will give the club "a global footprint." While a new phenomenon in Italy, foreign ownership is more prevalent in the rest of Europe. The English Premier League has 11 foreign-owned clubs, including Americans in charge at Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool and Qatari money funding Manchester City's continued growth. Qatar also has interests at the top of the French league, with reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain bankrolled by Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani. PSG's rivals Monaco are controlled by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev. Sheikh Abdullah bin Nasser bin Abdullah Al Ahmed Al Thani at Malaga is the only foreign owner in Spain's top flight, while there is no overseas ownership in Germany's Bundesliga. However, there will still be an Italian influence in the corridors of power at Inter's San Siro stadium with former president Massimo Moratti staying on as a member of the board. "I think Inter's history is going to be enriched by a new season thanks to our new international partners who, I am sure, will contribute to a continued string of successes," said Moratti, who has seen the team win 23 trophies under his family's stewardship. "The new partners' enthusiasm and pragmatism are certainly a guarantee for the future." The takeover reflects Asia's growing influence in world football, particularly in Indonesia. English clubs Chelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal all play matches in the country during preseason tours, while the Chinese Super League now boasts Italian World Cup winning coach Marcello Lippi, who is in place at Guangzhou Evergrande.

chatgpt: Inter Milan, one of Italy's most prestigious football clubs, has been purchased by Indonesian billionaire Erick Thohir in a deal worth an estimated â‚¬300m ($405m). The acquisition makes Inter Milan just the second Italian team to come under foreign ownership, after a U.S. consortium purchased a controlling stake in Roma in 2011. Thohir, who also owns stakes in both the Philadelphia 69ers basketball team and soccer's DC United, has been looking to invest in a football club for some time. He spoke of his excitement at taking over Inter Milan, saying, "I am delighted to have become the majority stakeholder in one of the world's greatest football clubs. This is a historic day for me and my family, and I promise to bring my passion and enthusiasm to the position." Inter Milan has a rich history, having won 18 Serie A titles, seven Coppa Italia trophies and three European Cups. However, in recent years, the club has struggled to keep up with rivals AC Milan and Juventus, who have enjoyed greater success in both domestic and European competitions. Thohir is looking to change this, stating, "Our goal is to bring the club back to where it belongs, competing at the highest level both in Italy and in Europe." Thohir is set to take over from the current president, Massimo Moratti, who will remain involved in the club as an honorary president. Thohir has said he will be looking to bring in new talent to strengthen the team, with rumours already circulating that he may look to bring in a high-profile manager to replace the current coach, Walter Mazzarri. Inter Milan fans have reacted positively to the news of Thohir's acquisition, with many hoping that the new owner will inject much-needed funds into the club to help them compete with their rivals. Some fans have expressed concern over the fact that the club will now be under foreign ownership, with many worried that the traditional values of Italian football will be lost. However, Thohir has reassured fans that he is committed to preserving the history and culture of Inter Milan. The acquisition of Inter Milan by Thohir is just the latest example of the increasing trend of foreign ownership in European football. While many fans are wary of the influence that foreign owners may have on their clubs, others see it as an opportunity for investment and growth. Thohir's success with his basketball and soccer teams in the United States has given Inter Milan fans hope that he will be able to replicate that success in Italy. In conclusion, the purchase of Inter Milan by Erick Thohir is a significant move for the club, and one that could potentially see them return to their former glory. Thohir has already promised to invest in the team and strengthen their position in both domestic and European competitions. While the move to foreign ownership may worry some fans, others see it as an opportunity for growth and investment, and are excited to see what the future holds for Inter Milan under Thohir's ownership.
