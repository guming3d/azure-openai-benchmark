article: (CNN) -- A federal judge Monday approved a deal dismissing a lawsuit against celebrity chef Paula Deen. The lawsuit, filed by a former employee who leveled accusations of racism and sexual harassment, was dismissed "with prejudice," meaning it cannot be filed again, according to a court filing. Deen's career and public reputation went into a tailspin this summer after her deposition in the lawsuit, in which she admitted using the "N-word" in the past, was released. In the media firestorm that followed, Deen lost lucrative endorsements and her Food Network cooking show, while the publication of her eagerly anticipated cookbook was canceled. Fans: 'We're sticking with Paula' U.S. District Judge William T. Moore Jr. in Savannah, Georgia, signed off on the deal, which requires both parties to pay their own court costs and attorney fees. It was not immediately clear whether there was a settlement. Earlier this month, Moore dismissed a portion of the lawsuit that contended former employee Lisa Jackson was a victim of racial discrimination. Jackson alleged that Deen and her brother, Bubba Hiers, committed numerous acts of violence, discrimination and racism that resulted in the end of her five years of employment at The Lady and Sons, and Uncle Bubba's Oyster House -- two Savannah, Georgia, restaurants run by Deen and her family. Savannah is where Deen built her business and brand into what many consider the folksy face of Southern cooking. When news of the deal to dismiss the lawsuit first spread last week, Deen released a statement, saying she believes "in kindness and fairness for everyone." "While this has been a difficult time for both my family and myself, I am pleased that the judge dismissed the race claims, and I am looking forward to getting this behind me, now that the remaining claims have been resolved," she said.

chatgpt: Paula Deen, the celebrated American chef and restaurateur, has had her fair share of controversies in the recent past. Deen, who rose to fame with her Southern cooking, was sued by a former employee for racial discrimination. The lawsuit, which stemmed from an incident that occurred in 2007, accused Deen of creating a hostile work environment that was peppered with racist remarks. The lawsuit went to trial in 2013, and Deen's deposition testimony came under intense scrutiny. During the questioning, Deen admitted to having used the "N-word" in the past, causing a media firestorm that engulfed her career. The admission led to a swift and substantial backlash, and Deen's partners began distancing themselves from the celebrity chef. As a result, Deen's career went into a tailspin. The Food Network, which had been home to Deen's popular cooking show, announced that it would not be renewing her contract. Other companies, including Walmart and Caesars Entertainment, also cut ties with Deen, resulting in a massive loss of revenue for her brand. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed "with prejudice," meaning it cannot be filed again. Despite this, Deen's reputation and career took a significant hit, and she has struggled to regain her footing in the industry ever since. However, Deen's supporters have argued that her use of the "N-word" was a product of her upbringing in the South and that she has since apologized and taken steps to educate herself on racial issues. Some of her former colleagues have also come to her defense, noting that she was a kind and generous person who never exhibited any discriminatory behavior in the workplace. In conclusion, Deen's career has undoubtedly been tarnished by the racial discrimination lawsuit and the admission of using the "N-word." However, whether she will be able to recover from this remains to be seen. It is clear that the incident has had a profound impact on both her personal life and her business ventures, and it is likely that the controversy will continue to follow her for years to come.
