article: Washington (CNN) -- Senior Navy enlistees seeking credentials to train others on using nuclear reactors that power carriers and subs are under investigation for cheating on an exam that may have involved classified information, top military officials said Tuesday. The troubling disclosure comes just weeks after the Air Force alleged widespread cheating on a proficiency test by officers with oversight responsibilities for nuclear missiles. Both involved written exams. "To say that I'm disappointed would be an understatement," Adm. Jonathan Greenert, the chief of naval operations, said at a news conference. Staff at the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program in Charleston, South Carolina, allegedly shared information about the test on reactor operations among themselves, officials said of their findings so far. There is no indication students were involved. The allegations came to light after a sailor in the unit came forward to share his concerns about potential dishonesty on exams. Navy responds to allegations . About 30 naval engineering watch supervisors have been decertified, meaning they cannot carry out certain duties, according to a Navy official. Those cited had previously been certified on nuclear systems, gone to sea, returned to shore duty and had to be certified as instructors to stand watch at training reactors. Navy officials said staff must qualify to operate and instruct students on a training reactor. The last incident of this kind occurred in 2010 aboard a sub, Navy officials said. Adm. John Richardson, director of the propulsion program, said the investigation is ongoing but did not disclose what information may have been exchanged. "But it's fair to say that these exams and the operation of the plants do involve classified information and that will be an active part of the investigation to fully understand that," he said. Navy officials stressed that the nuclear propulsion systems are not related to nuclear weapons. The Air Force scandal has swept up 92 officers at Malmstrom Air Force Base. That case involves a proficiency test. Some of those involved are accused of cheating on the test via text messaging last summer while others are accused of not speaking up about it. Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James described hearing about a culture for perfection within that unit that created a climate of undue stress and fear. But Richardson saw no parallels with the Air Force on that issue. Air Force cheating scandal . "With respect to the morale and the necessity to pass these exams in order to advance, that's not really a dimension of our program," he said. CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report.

chatgpt: Following a recent scandal at an Air Force nuclear base over cheating on proficiency exams, it appears that similar issues have arisen in the Navy. This time, the cheating scandal affects enlistees who are tested on their ability to manage and operate nuclear reactors on ships and submarines. The fallout from the scandal has already led to around 30 people having their authority to perform certain duties revoked. The Navy case highlights the ongoing problem of cheating in the military, which has the potential to put lives at risk. In recent years, there have been a number of high-profile cases where military personnel have been caught cheating on exams or other assessments. This has led to calls for stricter oversight and enforcement of exam regulations. According to reports, the scandal at the nuclear base involved Air Force officers cheating on a monthly proficiency exam. This exam is designed to ensure that personnel are competent and able to operate the nuclear missiles that form a critical part of the United States' defense capability. The cheating was uncovered during an investigation by the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, which found that more than 90 officers were involved. The Navy case appears to be similar in nature, with enlistees also cheating on exams that are designed to test their proficiency in managing nuclear reactors. It is not yet clear how many people were involved in the cheating, but it is understood that around 30 people have already lost their authority to perform certain duties as a result. This is a worrying development for the Navy, which relies heavily on the expertise of its personnel to operate the complex and powerful nuclear reactors that power its ships and submarines. Cheating on exams is not only unacceptable, but it also puts the lives of service members and civilians at risk. In response to the scandal, the Navy has launched an investigation to determine the extent of the problem and to take appropriate action against those who have been involved in cheating. This may include disciplinary action, such as demotion or discharge from the service. The fallout from the scandal is likely to be felt across the Navy, with increased scrutiny on its training and assessment practices. This is a critical issue for the military and must be addressed with urgency to ensure the safety and security of the nation's nuclear assets. Overall, the cheating scandal affecting the Navy highlights the ongoing challenge of maintaining high standards and accountability in the military. It is critical that the military takes this issue seriously and works to ensure that its personnel are properly trained, assessed and held accountable for their actions.
