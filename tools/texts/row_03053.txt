article: ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- An Atlanta, Georgia, lawyer, whose well-publicized bout with tuberculosis caused an international health scare, is suing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for invasion of privacy. Congress held hearings in June 2007 to discuss Andrew Speaker's TB case and the ensuing health scare. In the suit filed this week, Andrew Speaker alleges that the CDC released his name and sensitive medical information to the media in 2007, an act that harmed his reputation, his occupation and led to the ruin of his marriage. Speaker did not specify a dollar amount he was seeking in damages in the suit filed in U.S. District Court in Atlanta, Georgia. On May 29, 2007, the CDC held a press conference stating a patient with a rare form of tuberculosis, extensively drug-resistant TB which often proves fatal, had taken an international flight. The CDC, the suit alleges, did not in that press conference or other press conferences, tell the public that the organization told Speaker that he was not contagious and that the CDC knew Speaker had planned to take the trip to Greece for his wedding. Instead, the CDC unlawfully released extensive information about Speaker such as "the fact that he had flown to Greece to get married, the fact that he was a lawyer in Atlanta, and most importantly, his identity -- none of which needed to be released to the general public in order to accomplish any legitimate public health purpose," the suit said. On July 3, 2007, Speaker's doctors changed his diagnosis to multi-drug resistant TB, a less dangerous but still potentially fatal form of the illness. The suit alleges that the CDC's inaccurate release of information about him caused major harm. "Speaker became the object of unwanted public attention, including expressions of public scorn and contempt (including death threats) due to the inaccurate light in the information presented, resulting in so much strain on his marital relationship that he and his new bride parted ways after the wedding but before filing the marriage license," the suit alleges.

chatgpt: Andrew Speaker, a former tuberculosis patient, is suing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the unlawful release of his personal information. In 2007, Speaker flew to Greece for his wedding, triggering an international health scare when he was diagnosed with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB).  After his diagnosis, Speaker claims that the CDC released his personal information, which he alleges was a violation of his privacy. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia, seeks damages for emotional distress, harm to reputation, and invasion of privacy.  Speaker claims that the CDC's actions caused misinformation to spread, leading to harm to his reputation and the end of his marriage. The incident also led to widespread panic and fear among the public, with some fearing a pandemic outbreak of XDR-TB. In his lawsuit, Speaker argues that his medical information should have been kept private and that the CDC's release of information was unlawful. He also alleges that the media exaggerated his condition, causing him additional harm. The CDC has not yet commented on the lawsuit, but in the past has defended its actions, arguing that it was necessary to protect public health. The agency says it only released information that was necessary to warn individuals who may have come in contact with Speaker during his travels. Despite the controversy surrounding his case, Speaker has since recovered from his illness and has become an advocate for TB patients. He has spoken out about the importance of early diagnosis and treatment, and has called on governments around the world to invest more in TB prevention and research. The case highlights the delicate balance between public health concerns and individual privacy rights. While the CDC has a responsibility to protect public health, individuals like Speaker have a right to privacy and protection of their personal information. It remains to be seen how the court will rule on this important issue.
