article: By . Daily Mail Reporter . Staff at South Lakes Wild Animal Park have been banned from climbing ladders to put food on poles . Zoo keepers have been banned from climbing ladders when putting food for their tigers on top of 20ft poles. Putting the food on the poles allows the rare cats to climb and follow their hunting instincts, as well as entertaining thousands of visitors. But Barrow Borough Council has decreed it is too dangerous and imposed the health and safety ruling on South Lakes Safari Zoo in Dalton, Cumbria. It comes after a keeper was blown off her ladder this year in strong winds and suffered a broken collarbone. The zoo said its staff, who are estimated to have fed the tigers this way about 75,000 times in the past 18 years, now wear helmets, while the ladders are strapped to the poles. In a statement from the zoo posted on their Facebook page, it said: 'Even though the keepers now wear helmets, strap the ladders to the poles firmly and have permanent foot fixing points for the ladders, Barrow Borough Council wishes to stop us from feeding in this way as they claim it to be too dangerous for the staff.' It added that the ban would completely stop the ‘exciting’ feeding time practice and ‘our unique way of stimulating our cats’. Feeding the endangered Sumatran tigers this way was ‘a scientifically proven way’ of improving their health, fitness and welfare, the zoo said. The zoo said it had tried rope pulley systems and long poles to get the meat to the top of poles but it did not work. 'We have made every effort to find solutions that benefit the staff and the animals and yet we are still in this situation,' added the post. A Barrow Borough Council spokesperson said an improvement notice was served under section 21 of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. 'This notice was served because the park had failed to make a suitable and sufficient assessment of the risks to the health and safety of its employees to prevent a person falling a distance liable to cause personal injury whilst undertaking the routine placement of food at height for big cat carnivores,' added the spokesperson. Barrow Borough Council has a duty to ensure the health and safety of persons employed at the park and also visitors to the park.' Scroll down for video .

chatgpt: South Lakes Safari Zoo in Cumbria has been ordered by the Barrow Borough Council to stop using a controversial feeding method. The technique involves dangling pieces of meat on ropes or through mesh, so that the big cats, such as tigers and lions, can follow their natural instincts to hunt and entertain visitors. However, the council said that the method was too dangerous for the zoo's staff and needed to be stopped immediately. The keepers at the zoo are not happy about the decision, as the feeding method was seen as an important part of the animals' welfare. They argue that it allowed the cats to exhibit natural hunting behaviors and stimulated their minds. The staff also believed that the activity was one of the most popular attractions for visitors, and that the decision would have a negative impact on the zoo's revenue. The decision was taken after a keeper was blown off a ladder in strong winds earlier this year, and was left with a broken collarbone. The council deemed the incident as a serious matter and immediately took action to prevent similar incidents occurring in the future. The council cited health and safety reasons for the decision, and warned that any breach of the order would result in further action being taken. However, the zoo's management team is not willing to give up on the feeding method without a fight. They argue that the keepers have undergone extensive training, and that the feeding technique is used at zoos across the world, without issue. The management team has launched an appeal against the decision and is hopeful that a compromise can be found. The zoo's supporters have also come out in force to support the feeding method. They argue that the cats are not being mistreated and that the feeding technique allows them to exhibit natural behaviors that they would not be able to do in captivity. They say that the council's decision will only serve to make the animals more bored and listless, which could have a negative impact on their overall well-being. The decision by the council has also sparked a debate about the use of animals in captivity for entertainment. Some animal rights groups argue that the feeding technique is cruel and inhumane, and that it should be banned altogether. They say that the use of animals for human entertainment is outdated, and that the focus should be on conservation and preservation. The situation is likely to escalate in the coming weeks, as the zoo management team is prepared to take the matter to court if necessary. The council, however, has stood by its decision and remains committed to ensuring the safety of the zoo's staff. In conclusion, the decision by the Barrow Borough Council to ban the feeding method used at South Lakes Safari Zoo has stirred up a fierce debate about animal welfare and entertainment. While the council maintains that its decision was based on health and safety concerns, the zoo's staff and supporters argue that the feeding technique is vital for the animals' welfare and helps to stimulate their minds. The issue is likely to be resolved in a court of law, but until then, the future of the feeding method remains uncertain.
