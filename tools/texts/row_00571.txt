article: (CNN) -- The Golden Globes are the height of Hollywood glitz and glamour -- not exactly where you'd expect to find gritty reality at every turn. And yet, many of Sunday night's biggest winners were honored for roles and films based on real life. Recent films such as "Argo" and "Lincoln" racked up awards last year, but the 2014 Golden Globes were especially good to those who honored the past by recreating it. Both of this year's best pictures, "12 Years a Slave" and "American Hustle," were, as they say, "based on actual events," with Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence picking up individual honors for "Hustle." Leonardo DiCaprio earned a Golden Globe for playing real-life convicted fraudster Jordan Belfort in "The Wolf of Wall Street," and Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto received trophies for another true tale, "Dallas Buyers Club."

And to music, as U2 effusively praised the late Nelson Mandela when the group accepted its award for a song from "Mandela: Long Walk To Freedom." In all, 10 Golden Globes went to films and actors that brought drama rooted in reality to the screen. As if to underscore the power that real-life stories can bring to film and television, two of the night's biggest ovations went not to actors or directors, but to people portrayed on film this year: Philomena Lee, the woman searching for her long-lost son, played by Dame Judi Dench in "Philomena," and Niki Lauda, the legendary Formula One racer played by Daniel Bruhl in "Rush." As he spoke, Lauda removed his cap to show his head, scarred by the fiery, near-fatal crash at the movie's center. The audience at the Beverly Hilton Hotel cheered him, and "Rush" star Chris Hemsworth beamed -- the man who plays "Thor" obviously thrilled to share the stage with a real-life action hero.

chatgpt: The 71st Golden Globe Awards ceremony on Sunday night saw a noticeable trend of award-winning films that were inspired by true events. Ten of the night's awards went to films that had real-life origins, including "12 Years a Slave," "American Hustle," and "Dallas Buyers Club."  Another notable film with a real-life connection was "Philomena," which received three nominations and tells the story of an elderly woman searching for her long-lost son, who was taken away from her as a result of forced adoption. The heartwarming story ultimately earned lead actress Judi Dench a nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture - Drama.  The trend didn't stop with films. The TV movie "Behind the Candelabra," which told the story of Liberace and his relationship with his young lover, won both Best Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television and Best Actor in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television for Michael Douglas.  Meanwhile, U2 took home the Best Original Song award for "Ordinary Love" from "Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom." The film, which follows the life of South African political leader Nelson Mandela, was based on his autobiography of the same name.  The fascination with true stories in entertainment is not a new trend. In fact, many award-winning films in recent years have been inspired by real-life events. "Argo," which won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama in 2013, was based on the true story of a CIA operation to rescue American hostages in Iran.  Similarly, "The Social Network," which won multiple awards in 2011, was loosely based on the founding of Facebook and the ensuing legal battles that followed.  One reason for the enduring appeal of true stories in entertainment is the sense of authenticity they convey. Audiences connect with characters and events that have a real-life basis, and filmmakers and writers often have access to rich source material when adapting these stories for the screen.  Whatever the reason, it's clear that the trend for true stories in entertainment is here to stay. With the success of this year's crop of Golden Globe nominees, it's likely that we'll see many more films and TV shows inspired by real-life events in the coming years.
