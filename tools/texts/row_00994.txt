article: Four suspects have been questioned in Portugal in connection with the 2007 disappearance of Madeleine McCann, a source close to the investigation told CNN on Wednesday. The suspects, all Portuguese, were questioned by Portuguese police, with the assistance of Scotland Yard, as London's Metropolitan Police are known. One of the suspects suffers from schizophrenia, one is a former taxi driver, and another was just 16 years old at the time of the girl's disappearance, the source said. Madeleine was a few weeks shy of her fourth birthday when she vanished from her family's holiday apartment in the Portuguese resort town of Praia da Luz. Her parents had left Madeleine and her younger twin siblings asleep while they went for dinner with friends at a tapas restaurant nearby. Her mother raised the alarm when she checked on the children about 10 p.m. and discovered her daughter missing. According to the source, Scotland Yard is focusing on the four suspects because some of them made calls to one another the night of the girl's disappearance, as well as the night before and the night after. They had asked to search the suspects' homes, but were denied by courts that found no evidence to warrant such a search, the source said. Scotland Yard believes the four suspects called one another to plan a robbery, which went wrong when they saw the girl at the home. British police recently finished digging in an area of wasteland close to where Madeleine went missing in Portugal. They searched two areas, according to the source, and will be leaving Portugal in the next few days. In July 2013, Scotland Yard reopened its investigation into the little girl's disappearance after a two-year review of the original probe. Portuguese police reopened their investigation last October. At the time, the Metropolitan Police said the two police forces' investigations would run in parallel. Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, launched a massive publicity campaign to find their daughter after she went missing. They say they continue to believe she is still alive.

chatgpt: Two Portuguese suspects are being investigated in connection with the disappearance of Madeleine McCann in 2007. According to a source, one of the suspects suffers from schizophrenia. Said to be in their 40s, the male and female suspects allegedly lived in the Algarve region of Portugal when three-year-old Madeleine went missing from her family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz.  The investigation was reopened in 2013 by British police, who have worked alongside Portuguese authorities in following up new leads. Earlier this year, officers were said to be focusing on the possibility that the young girl may have been snatched by a paedophile ring operating in the area at the time.  Reports suggest that the current line of inquiry revolves around the pair, who have been named as arguidos, or formal suspects, in the case. The man was reportedly arrested earlier this week and his apartment searched for evidence, while the woman was detained for questioning. The authorities have declined to comment further on the case, but have said that the investigation is ongoing.  The parents of Madeleine, Kate and Gerry McCann, have said they are "encouraged" by the latest developments, but are cautious about the possibility of a breakthrough in the case. "We are pleased that the investigation is continuing and that progress is being made," said a spokesperson for the family. "Obviously, we would be delighted if it led to some answers about what happened to Madeleine, but we are still very much in the dark about that." Madeleine's disappearance sparked an enormous search operation, with sightings reported around the world. The case has become one of the most high-profile missing person investigations in recent history, with the media and public following every twist and turn. The girl's parents have campaigned tirelessly for her return, marking the anniversary of her disappearance each year with calls for information. They have also worked to raise awareness of child abduction and launched an appeal to fund a hotline for families in similar situations.
