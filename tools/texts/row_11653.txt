article: Ryder Cup star Thomas Bjorn is pleased to be out on the course again after a couple of weeks struggling to get out of bed with a back problem. The Dane's solitary appearance this year came at the Dubai Desert Classic, where he missed the cut earlier this month, but he feels in better shape as he tees it up at the True Thailand Classic, a new event on the European Tour. 'Everything is in good shape; I'm coming off a good break and I'm raring to go,' said Bjorn, who turns 44 next week. Thomas Bjorn is glad to have returned to action at the True Thailand Classic after nursing a bad back . 'I went through a rough spell in January with my back and struggled to get out of bed for the best part of a couple of weeks, but that's recovered now. 'I'm still feeling a little bit sore and a little bit stiff, but I'm through it and don't have anything that causes me any problems. 'Playing now is feeling better and better each day, and the heat certainly won't hurt it this week. 'I'm feeling pretty happy with where I am, if perhaps not 100 per cent. 'You're never quite sure how it will go until the gun goes, but I'm looking forward to getting out there tomorrow and trying to make some birdies.' Bjorn takes his shot on the putting green at the 2015 True Thailand Classic at the Black Mountain Golf Club . One of five new events on the schedule this year, the European Tour returns to Thailand for the first time in eight years. Tournament ambassador Thongchai Jaidee is attached to the Black Mountain Golf Club near the coastal town of Hua Hin, and hopes to make the most of home advantage. 'I have played pretty consistently, but I haven't been in top form yet,' he said. 'I am trying to do my best this week to move up on the Tour ranking (he is currently 23rd). 'I just want to do better than I did last year; I will try my best. 'The course condition is superb this week. The greens are super fast, so people who are good putters have a good chance of winning this tournament. 'Thai players should do pretty well but it will all depend on the timing and opportunity.' Bjorn, Johan Edfors and tournament ambassador  Thongchai Jaidee watch on at a Muay Thai exhibition .
