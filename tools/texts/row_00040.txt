article: New York (CNN) -- A New York judge has thrown out a lawsuit filed by a group of atheists, ruling that a pair of World Trade Center beams in the shape of a cross can be included in a memorial museum of the 9/11 terror attacks. American Atheists filed the lawsuit in July, arguing that the "government enshrinement of the cross" was an impermissible mingling of church and state. The World Trade Center cross, two intersecting steel beams that held up when the twin towers collapsed on September 11, 2001, is seen as iconic to some. In 2011: Cross moved to permanent 9/11 Memorial site . The cross was moved in July from near a church to its new home at the 9/11 Memorial and Museum, located at ground zero in Lower Manhattan. Father Brian Jordan, a Franciscan priest who ministered to workers clearing the area after the attacks, led a ceremonial blessing of the cross. Federal Judge Deborah Batts of the Southern District of New York ruled Thursday that display of the beams is permissible because they bear historical importance.

"The museum is gratified by the decision," Mark Alcott, the lawyer for the 9/11 Memorial and Museum, told CNN on Friday. "The plan has been to display this as one of hundreds and hundreds of artifacts ... because it is part of the history of the recovery efforts after the 911 attacks. "For some of these people, [the cross] had symbolic significance," he continued, referring to first responders. "They treated it as a religious object and it gave them a great deal of comfort at a difficult time. The 9/11 museum is simply depicting what happened." David Silverman, president of American Atheists, told CNN, "We are angry that we have to have this fight." Silverman said it was clear that the cross was regarded as sacred, noting that it "was installed in a religious service on consecrated ground by a priest. How anyone could say that is secular is beyond me." September 11 "affected all Americans, not just Christians," Silverman continued. "We will not sit and let the 500 atheists who died on 9/11 go unnoticed." Silverman said his group plans to appeal the decision. "We are confident that we will eventually win this case and that cross will be removed, or atheists will be allowed to have our own symbol in there," he said.

chatgpt: In a recent court decision, a judge has thrown out a lawsuit brought by an atheist group challenging the inclusion of two intersecting steel beams in the National September 11 Memorial and Museum. The beams are considered iconic symbols of the World Trade Center's resilience and are on display at the museum.  The group, known as American Atheists, argued that the presence of the beams, which were recovered from the wreckage of the Twin Towers after the 9/11 attacks, amounted to a government endorsement of religion. They claimed that the beams, which resembled a cross, represented the Christian faith and violated the separation of church and state.  However, the judge ruled that the museum's display of the beams is permissible because they have historical significance and represent an important artifact from one of the most significant events in American history. The judge stated that the beams depict a moment of resilience and hope, rather than a religious symbol.  The president of American Atheists, David Silverman, expressed his disappointment in the ruling but highlighted that the case had a broader significance beyond the museum. He emphasized that the case was about equality and the need to ensure that all Americans, regardless of their religious beliefs, are treated equally.  "9/11 affected all Americans, not just Christians," said Silverman. He added that the group plans to continue their efforts to ensure that the government remains neutral on issues of religion and that all Americans receive fair and equal treatment.  The inclusion of religious symbols in public places has been a controversial issue in the United States for many years. Many religious groups argue that such symbols are a part of the country's heritage and should be allowed in public spaces, while others argue that including such symbols violates the principle of separation of church and state.  In the past, the Supreme Court has held that the government cannot endorse or promote a particular religion. However, the inclusion of religious symbols in public spaces is often a matter of interpretation and has been the subject of intense debate in recent years.  Ultimately, the judge's decision to allow the display of the intersecting steel beams in the 9/11 museum represents a victory for those who believe that such symbols have historical significance and reflect important moments in American history. It also highlights the ongoing debate surrounding the role of religion in public life and the need to ensure that all Americans receive equal treatment under the law.
