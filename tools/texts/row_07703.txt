article: (CNN) -- The attorney for Scott A. Smith, who was arrested after attending the latest Batman movie armed with a gun, ammunition and knives, said the deadly shooting in Aurora, Colorado, last month prompted his client to bring the weapons for protection. "He had a fear and wanted to protect himself," attorney Matthew Bruce said Friday. Smith, 37, made his first appearance in court Thursday and is currently being held on $250,000 bond. He was arrested Saturday and charged with two counts of carrying a concealed weapon and 19 counts related to carrying weapons "under disability," charges that refer to the effects of prescription drugs Smith was taking, said Nicole DiSanto of the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor's Office. Police say Saturday night Smith went to the Regal Theater in Westlake, Ohio, to see the 10:30 p.m. showing of "The Dark Knight Rises." CNN poll: Gun control attitudes haven't changed after shootings . According to DiSanto, Smith was the first to arrive, 30 minutes before the movie's start, and took a seat in the back row, directly in the middle, with his back to a wall. A manager at the theater and an off-duty police officer grew suspicious of where he sat, and they noticed the bag Smith was carrying. They asked to search the bag, DiSanto said, and inside found a loaded 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, two loaded magazine clips and three knives. Police said Smith was carrying another knife on his person. His attorney said he had arrived early to get the best seat in the theater. "That's just the kind of person he is," said Bruce, who acknowledged that Smith was not carrying the gun legally. Smith told the off-duty officer he was carrying the gun and knives for protection, to protect himself and other moviegoers, said police, who took him into custody. A search of Smith's home turned up more weapons, including rifles, shotguns and survivalist gear. Analysis: Fewer U.S. gun owners own more guns . Westlake police Lt. Ray Arcuri said police believe Smith's position in the movie theater was "tactical:" not only was he protected from the back, but he could have fired to his right, left and center on anyone in the theater in front of him. About 80 people attended the movie that night. In 1995, Smith enlisted in the U.S. Army but did not finish basic training, according to Army spokesman George Wright. The charges against Smith follow the mass shooting last month in Aurora, Colorado, where a gunman fired on a crowd of moviegoers watching a showing of "The Dark Knight Rises." The attack killed 12 people. CNN's Julian Cummings, Deb Feyerick and Karan Olson contributed to this report.

chatgpt: In a new development in the ongoing case of a man caught carrying weapons to a movie theater, his attorney has revealed that the recent Colorado shooting played a role in his client's actions. The incident, in which twelve people were killed and dozens more injured, has been the subject of intense scrutiny and debate, and it seems its impact has been felt far beyond the borders of the state where it occurred. The attorney, who spoke to reporters on Thursday, explained that his client had become increasingly worried about his safety in public places in the wake of the Colorado shooting. He had reportedly become convinced that he might be targeted by someone seeking to imitate the shooter, and had taken it upon himself to arm himself just in case. According to the attorney, his client had no intention of using the weapons he carried to harm anyone. Instead, he simply wanted to ensure that he was prepared to defend himself in the event of an attack. However, his plan was foiled when a theater manager and police officer became suspicious of his behavior. The man in question, identified as John Smith, had purchased a ticket to a movie and taken a seat near the back of the theater. However, his chosen location raised eyebrows among staff and law enforcement officials, who believed that he may have been looking for a vantage point from which to carry out an attack. When Smith was approached by the theater manager and questioned about his behavior, he allegedly became agitated and defensive. The manager then called the police, who arrived on the scene and discovered that Smith was carrying a gun and several knives. Smith was immediately taken into custody, and has since been charged with multiple counts of illegal possession of a weapon. He has also been ordered to undergo a psychological evaluation to determine whether he poses a threat to himself or others. The incident has once again raised questions about gun control in the United States, and has highlighted the anxiety and fear that many Americans continue to feel in the wake of mass shootings. Despite numerous calls for stricter legislation, however, little progress has been made on this front in recent years. In the meantime, many are left to wonder what can be done to prevent tragedies like the one in Colorado from occurring again. Some have suggested increased security measures at public places like movie theaters, while others argue that only a comprehensive overhaul of the nation's gun laws can truly make a difference. As for John Smith, his fate remains uncertain. While he may have had good intentions in carrying weapons to a movie theater, the fact remains that his actions were illegal and potentially dangerous. The hope is that his case will serve as a cautionary tale for others, and that it will encourage a more nuanced discussion about how best to ensure public safety in the years to come.
