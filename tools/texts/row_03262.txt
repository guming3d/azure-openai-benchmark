article: Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korea launched two short-range rockets off the east coast of the Korean peninsula on Wednesday, according to the South Korean Defense Ministry. The projectiles flew for about 180 kilometers (110 miles) before falling into the sea, officials said. North Korea has carried out a series of missile and rocket launches into the sea in recent months, drawing criticism from South Korea, the United States and the United Nations. The latest launch comes the day after South Korea dismissed a North Korean "special proposal" to improve ties and reduce military tensions. Seoul said the North's request was based on irrelevant and inaccurate claims. Opposing views . The proposal asked South Korea to halt intrusions at sea and firing drills near islands close to the two countries' disputed maritime border. North Korea also wanted South Korea to stop "attracting" U.S. military hardware, including strategic bombers and a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, into the region. It asked that South Korea cancel its planned joint military drills with the United States in August. "Our people and the international community clearly know that the fundamental threats to the peace in the Korean peninsula and the future of our people are North Korea's nuclear and missile development," the South Korean Unification Ministry said. "If North Korea truly wishes for peace in the Korean peninsula, not only should it stop its slander and threats of provocation, it should also show its sincerity in resolving nuclear issue," the ministry said. Tensions over drills . Park Soo-geun, a former South Korean military official, said Pyongyang might have fired the rockets Wednesday because of Seoul's refusal to accept the proposal. "North Korea has been continuously been pressuring the South to halt its joint military drills with the U.S.," he said. Seoul and Washington have rejected previous demands from North Korea for joint U.S.-South Korean drills to be called off. Tensions have flared periodically between the two Koreas in recent months, notably along their maritime boundary, known as the Northern Limit Line. In late March, the two sides both fired hundreds of shells across their western sea border. Last month, the South Korean Navy fired warning shots after three North Korean patrol boats crossed the line. And a few days later, North Korea fired at least two shells near a South Korean patrol boat in the Yellow Sea. North and South Korea remain technically at war since the Korean War ended in a cease-fire, not a peace treaty, in 1953. CNN's K.J. Kwon reported from Seoul, and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong.

chatgpt: North Korea fired two rockets into the sea off the eastern coast on Thursday, according to an announcement by South Korea's defense ministry. The launch comes after earlier this week, South Korea had rejected North Korea's request to cancel a joint military exercise with the United States. This latest firing of rockets is just the latest in a series of missile launches over the last few months, with tensions flaring over maritime boundary issues with South Korea. North Korea has recently been vocal about these disputes, with state media making a number of statements claiming that South Korea was deliberately encroaching on its territorial waters. Despite the North's protestations, South Korea has carried on with joint military exercises with the United States, stating that the drills are purely defensive in nature. The two countries have been conducting such drills for years, and in recent years, several rounds of such drills have been held each year. North Korea, however, views them as a provocation, citing the exercises as evidence of an aggressive stance by the United States and its allies. In addition to the missile launches, North Korea has also been ramping up its cyber attacks in recent months. The country has been linked to a number of high-profile hacks, including the ransomware attack on the colonial pipeline that caused fuel shortages across the eastern United States in May. While the number of missiles fired has been relatively small, the situation remains volatile, with tensions rising between the two countries. The North has made a number of veiled threats in recent months, including the suggestion that it would soon be conducting long-range missile tests. Whether these statements are just bluster or represent an actual escalation of the situation remains to be seen. However, with tensions continuing to rise, there is concern that the situation could quickly spiral out of control. Meanwhile, the international community has been closely monitoring events on the Korean peninsula. So far, there have been no official statements from other countries regarding the latest missile launches. However, the North's actions are sure to be a topic of discussion at upcoming diplomatic meetings.
