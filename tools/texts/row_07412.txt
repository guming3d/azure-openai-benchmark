A North Carolina man was billed $80,000 for an 18-hour hospital stay last summer after being bitten by a snake - and almost all of the bill was for anti-venom. Eric Furguson, 54, of Mooresville, was shocked when he received the massive bill from Lake Norman Regional Medical Center attributing more than $81,000 of the cost to a four-vial dose of anti-venom. He told the Charlotte Observer he was able to find the same anti-venom online at prices ranging from $750 to 12,000 per vial, a staggering difference for which they demanded an explanation. Sticker shock: Laura and Eric Ferguson were surprised after receiving their almost $90,000 bill from Lake Norman Regional Medical Center . Mr Ferguson’s health insurance through Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina reduced the total bill from Lake Norman Regional Medical Center to just over $20,000, of which he paid a deductible of about $5,400 – but his wife worried about the cost of being uninsured. ‘What if it was someone that didn’t have the resources to research and didn’t have insurance?’ Wife Laura Ferguson wondered aloud to the paper. ‘What is fair and equitable here?’ When reached by the Observer, the hospital released a statement saying it rarely charges list prices.‘We are required to give Medicare one level of discount from list price, Medicaid another, and private insurers negotiate for still others,’ said the statement. ‘If we did not start with the list prices we have, we would not end up with enough revenue to remain in operation… Our costs for providing uncompensated care are partially covered by higher bills for other patients. Lake Norman Regional Medical Center: The hospital where the $90,000 bill was incurred last summer . ‘In some cases, Lake Norman Regional’s charge is considerably higher than other local hospitals,’ the statement continued, explaining that discounts of about 62 to 65 percent are offered to patients without insurance, according to the Observer. A lawsuit was filed in 2010 by doctors at Lake Norman and another local hospital accusing the medical facilities of offering kickbacks to doctors who could provide unnecessary treatment. Parent company Health Management Associates denied the allegations, but declined further comment. The Fergusons’ concern is not solitary. A Time magazine expose last year on the cost of medical care in the U.S. revealed Americans spend $2.8trillion a year – 20 per cent of Gross Domestic Product – on medical care.

chatgpt: Eric Ferguson's search for four vials of anti-venom turned out to be a costly lesson in healthcare pricing in the US. Ferguson discovered that the same vials of anti-venom, which were being offered to him for $20,000 each by the hospital, were available online for as little as $750 each. His insurance reduced the bill, but the price still left him shaken. The incident raises questions about pricing policies at hospitals and the struggles many Americans face to afford healthcare. Ferguson's story highlights a fundamental problem in the US healthcare system. The cost of medical treatment is one of the highest in the world, and many Americans struggle to pay for even the most basic services. This issue is further compounded by the inconsistent pricing policies followed by hospitals. According to Ferguson, the hospital where he was treated claimed that it offered discounts to uninsured patients. But the fact remains that many insured Americans are forced to pay higher rates to offset the cost of uninsured care. This problem is particularly pronounced in states that have declined to expand Medicaid coverage, leaving a significant number of people without health insurance. Ferguson's experience serves as a cautionary tale for other patients who may face similar situations. It is essential to research options and understand what costs you may be responsible for before agreeing to any medical treatment. As Americans continue to debate healthcare reform, stories like Ferguson's highlight the need for a more comprehensive and affordable system. A significant change in policy is required if the US healthcare system is to become more equitable and accessible to all citizens. The spokesperson for the hospital where Ferguson was treated declined to comment on the specifics of his case but stated that they offer discounts to uninsured patients and that pricing is set to reflect the cost of the service. However, this response fails to address the larger problem of high healthcare prices in the US. In conclusion, Eric Ferguson's story sheds light on the struggles many Americans face when dealing with high healthcare prices. His experience highlights the need for a more comprehensive and affordable healthcare system that is accessible to all. As Americans continue to debate healthcare reform, Ferguson's story serves as a sobering reminder of just how broken the system can be.
