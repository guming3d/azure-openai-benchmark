article: Los Angeles (CNN) -- Juanita Moore, the third African-American actress to ever get a supporting actress Oscar nomination, died of natural causes at her Los Angeles home Tuesday, her grandson said. She was 99. Moore worked right to the end, preparing for a stage reading of a new play and helping her actor grandson learn lines, Kirk Kellykhan said, . "I just got cursed out that morning about learning my lines," Kellykhan said. Moore was helping him prepare for the lead in the West Coast production of the Broadway play "The Wedding Man," he said. She was scheduled to take part in a January 17 reading of a play based on Michael St. John's book "Hollywood Through the Backdoor," her grandson said. Moore was nominated for a best supporting actress Oscar in 1960 for Douglas Sirk's "Imitation of Life." She played a housekeeper whose daughter passes for white. A Los Angeles native, she began her entertainment career as a Cotton Club chorus girl and a film extra. At the same time, she worked on her acting skills on stage in the Ebony Showcase Theater. Moore's feature film debut came in 1949 when she played a nurse in "Pinky." Most of her roles in the 1950s were as domestics, until she was cast as Annie Johnson in "Imitation of Life." The story was about Johnson's light-skinned daughter denying her racial roots. The lack of roles for African-American actresses in the early 1960s made it difficult for Moore to find big-screen jobs despite the accolades for her work. She acted in supporting roles in 1961 in "Tammy, Tell Me True" and in 1963 in "Papa's Delicate Condition." Moore did land a significant role as a nun in the 1966 hit "The Singing Nun." As more black-themed movies were made near the end of the decade, her career improved. She acted in "Uptight" in 1968, "The Mack" in 1973 and "Abby" in 1974. While she cut back on acting work in the 1980s, she never retired. She played a wise grandmother in "Disney's The Kid" in 2000, while acting in television guest roles in "ER" and "Judging Amy."

chatgpt: Hollywood icon Juanita Moore, best known for her role as Annie Johnson in the 1959 film "Imitation of Life," passed away at the age of 99. Moore was a trailblazer for African American actresses during the early days of American cinema, and her performances were widely lauded for their depth and complexity. Moore was born in 1914 in Greenwood, Mississippi, and moved to Los Angeles when she was a child. After studying acting at the Actor's Laboratory, she landed small roles in films such as "The Girl Can't Help It" and "Saintly Sinners." However, it wasn't until she was cast as Annie Johnson in "Imitation of Life" that she truly made her mark on Hollywood. The film, which was directed by Douglas Sirk, tells the story of two single mothers, one of whom is black and the other is white, who raise their daughters together. Moore's character, Annie, is a housekeeper whose light-skinned daughter passes for white. As the film progresses, the two women's fortunes diverge, and Annie's daughter ultimately rejects her in order to pass as white. Moore's powerful performance in the film earned her a Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress in 1960. Although she didn't win the award, she remained a beloved figure in Hollywood and continued to act for many years. According to her grandson, Moore worked until her last days, preparing for a stage reading that was set to take place this month. He described her as a tireless and dedicated actress who never lost her passion for her craft. "Even at her age, she was still doing what she loved best â€“ acting," he said. "She was always working on something, whether it was a play or a film or something else. She never gave up on her dreams." Moore's legacy as an actress and a trailblazer for African American performers will continue to resonate for years to come. She opened doors for countless other actresses who came after her and showed that it was possible to succeed in an industry that was often hostile to people of color. As Hollywood pays tribute to a true legend, it is clear that Juanita Moore's impact on American cinema will never be forgotten.
