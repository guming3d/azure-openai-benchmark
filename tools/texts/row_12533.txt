After a marathon campaign the former principal oboist from the Welsh National Opera has proved he was unfairly sacked. Now judges at the Court of Appeal have urged the warring woodwind section of the company to return to harmony after they ruled that Murray 'Sandy' Johnston was unfairly dismissed. Talented Mr Johnston, 63, was sacked after 34 years in the ranks of the WNO on grounds that the sound of his instrument did not 'blend' with the rest of the orchestra. Clash: Murray Johnson (left) was unfairly dismissed, following long term difficulties with Carlo Rizzi (right) He was made to go through auditions to prove that his instrument was acceptable to the orchestra. But the musician claimed his career with WNO began to wane following a personality clash with former musical director, Carlo Rizzi. After long-term 'difficulties' in the . relationship between the oboeist and Mr Rizzi, Mr Johnston had satisfied . assessors, including the then music director, that his 'intonation' and . 'emission of sound' came up to scratch during auditions. Murray Johnston has finally proved he was unfairly dismissed . However, he continued to face . criticism of his perceived shortcomings in 'ensemble' situations and the . 'blending of sound' between his instrument and the orchestra. His dismissal came after the WNO said . that aspect of his playing could not be tested by audition with a . pianist to accompany him but only in 'full ensemble conditions'. Although the WNO purported to follow . the disciplinary procedure laid down in its handbook, it did not comply . with the operaâ€™s agreement with the Musicians Union, which was designed . to protect musicians from 'too subjective an assessment' of their . artistic performance. The judge, sitting with Lords Justice . Moore-Bick and Sullivan, said it was 'inevitable' that it would be found . that the disciplinary procedure to which Mr Johnston was subjected for . his perceived artistic failings was 'procedurally unfair'. Lord Justice Kay said: 'To subject Mr . Johnston to the handbook disciplinary procedure, minus the requirements . of oral, written and final warnings, was procedurally unfair, even if . the concern was to save him from additional stress.' After today's decision the case will now return to an employment tribunal for the amount of compensation payable by the WNO to Mr Johnston to be assessed. However, after pointing to the massive cost of three previous contested hearing, Lord Justice Maurice Kay said: 'I hope that the parties will give active consideration to the possibility of a negotiated settlement, if necessary through mediation'. After ruling that the disciplinary procedure followed lacked the element of objectivity that would have made it fair, the judge concluded: 'It was not a reasonable response to the problem that had arisen... I consider that a finding of procedural unfairness is inevitable'. Battleground: The Wales Millennium Centre serves as an arts center and housed the WNO .

chatgpt: After over three decades working as a musician with the Welsh National Opera (WNO), Murray Johnston has been sacked from the orchestra. Johnston claimed that his career with the WNO took a downward turn after a personality clash with the musical director. He insisted that his musical ability and skill had not diminished but that his career had suffered as a result of the disagreement. The WNO, however, disputes Johnston's account, saying that his dismissal was a result of his artistic failings. The organization cited a disciplinary procedure that assessed Johnston's performance as being below standard. Johnston challenged this decision in court, and a judge has now ruled that the disciplinary process he was put through was unfair. The judge agreed with Johnston's claim that he had been treated unfairly, and that his artistic ability and value to the orchestra had not changed. During the court proceedings, Johnston's legal team argued that he had suffered from worsening working conditions after the altercation with the musical director. Johnston's barrister argued that the disciplinary process that led to his dismissal was biased and that the organization had not taken into account his contributions and experience with the orchestra. The WNO responded by saying that the process was impartial and independent, and that the issues raised were purely artistic in nature. The organization maintained that its decision was based on performance rather than personality. The judge found in favor of Johnston, ruling that the disciplinary procedure was unfair due to its inadequate investigation and lack of transparency. In his statement, the judge found that "the dismissal of Mr. Johnston was procedurally unfair, as the disciplinary process used was fundamentally flawed." The judge also disagreed with the WNO's assertion that Johnston's dismissal was due to artistic failings. The judge noted that Johnston had received positive reviews in the past and that he had not been given a fair opportunity to defend himself against the allegations. Johnston has since released a statement thanking his legal team and supporters for their help during the court proceedings. He also expressed his desire to return to performing music and shared his hope that orchestras would take into account the importance of fair treatment of their musicians. The WNO has yet to comment on the ruling but has indicated that it will be reviewing its disciplinary procedures. The case highlights the importance of fair treatment and transparency in the workplace, particularly in the creative and performing arts industries, where subjective opinions can play a significant role in determining success or failure.
