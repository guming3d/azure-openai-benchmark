article: London (CNN) -- If there's one thing you notice in the Financial Times' sprawling office building on London's Southwark Bridge it's that there are newspapers...everywhere. Piles upon piles of trademark salmon pink paper, the fruit of endless days of hard work that even the most seasoned journalists can't bring themselves to recycle. They fill every gap between desks, there are stacks on the floor, and in corridors, next to the odd cursory pot plant. There's a charm about it, that of a place with its priorities straight. Substance over style. Inside the Financial Times: Discover more . Editor Lionel Barber tells me that when he started the Financial Times, the newsroom was full of "cigarette smoke and typewriters making a lot of noise." The typewriters are long gone and, with them, most of the noise. But, says Barber, "there is still something special about a newsroom." Twenty years ago the piles of newspapers may not have been so striking. Hard to believe now, but ft.com only launched in 1995. This year -- 17 years later -- digital subscriptions overtook print for the first time. This has undoubtedly changed the way the operation runs. Read more: The most influential business books . Breaking news happens in real time, screens with 24 hour news channels hang in the newsroom, and the journalists have the concentration of greyhounds on the blocks. Barber has an interesting view of this. "Working for the print newspaper and for ft.com," he says, "is a little like walking and chewing gum at the same time -- it is actually possible."

Chief executive John Ridding says people thought they were "a little strange, to put it politely", but they stuck with it, and it's worked. The numbers are proof enough. Over 300,000 digital subscribers and sales up 7% in the first half of this year. And, Ridding says, there's an "accidental benefit" that has transformed the business. They don't just know how many people are reading, they know who they are and what they are reading. That "enables us to do a much better job of developing products and services and being relevant to our readers," he added. The Financial Times' business is solid. The digital future, however, is not without collateral damage. CNN spent a day with the Financial Times in April, observing everything from the morning editorial meeting, to the evening frenzy at the east London print site. In September, the owners of that print site, Newsfax, went into administration, and the Financial Times' subsidiary St Clement's Press had to step in to run the site. Walking and chewing gum is possible, but not without risks.

chatgpt: In today's digital age, many industries have had to adapt to survive. The newspaper industry is no exception. CNN's Clare Sebastian recently went behind the scenes of the Financial Times in London to see how the paper has evolved to thrive in the digital era. Upon her arrival, Sebastian was greeted with piles of newsprint. However, she quickly learned that the Financial Times is an organization with a laser focus on digital. The paper is up-to-date on the latest technologies, and it is evident that its team is dedicated to keeping up with the ever-changing technological landscape.  The Financial Times has had to make significant changes to its operations to ensure that it remains competitive in the digital age. Filing for both print and digital platforms is now seen as essential to the paper's success. The art of filing for print and digital simultaneously has been compared to 'walking and chewing gum' at the same time. While this skill can be honed over time, it is not without its challenges. The Financial Times has adapted an 'online-first' mentality through a reduction of its print publication. The paper now focuses its resources on digital, with print serving as an extension of its digital content. This shift has proven to be a wise choice, as the Financial Times has seen an increase in its digital subscribers. As people have come to expect instant gratification in this on-demand world, they're not willing to wait for daily printed newspapers anymore. However, like any change, there have been some risks involved. The Financial Times is no stranger to digital disruption, having survived past disruptions like Craigslist, Google, and Facebook. The paper has learned to be vigilant and flexible in its approach to new technologies. The Financial Times has had to innovate to stay ahead of the game, particularly by diversifying its content offerings to include podcasts, videos, and social media. This diversification ensures that the paper reaches a broad audience using a variety of platforms. A case in point, Mashable reported last year that the Financial Times had gained over half a million subscribers during the pandemic, demonstrating that people still value quality journalism in a post-print world. The Financial Times is an excellent example of an organization that has adapted and thrived against all odds. By embracing technology and diversifying its content offerings, the paper has remained a relevant source of news in this on-demand digital age. Although filing for print and digital simultaneously may seem like a challenging task, the Financial Times has made it seem effortless. In conclusion, the Financial Times has demonstrated that it is entirely possible to succeed as a newspaper even in the digital age. By remaining nimble and innovative in its approach, the paper has managed to overcome the challenges of the changing technological landscape, and it looks set to continue its success for many years to come.
