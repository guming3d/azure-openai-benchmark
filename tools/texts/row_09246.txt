article: It took until the end of December before Neil Warnock became the first Barclays Premier League manager sacked this season but the overall trend towards greater managerial instability still deepens, especially at Championship clubs. Across the top four tiers of English football, there were 34 managerial changes and 27 dismissals between the start of the season and December 31. This beats the previous high of 24, set last season – and there were 12 dismissals in the Championship, which is also a record, five more than in the previous two years. Dave Hockaday (second left) was Leeds United manager... one of four to have the role this season . Neil Warnock was the first Premier League manager to go this season... from Crystal Palace in December . 2005-06: 13 . 2006-07: 22 . 2007-08: 20 . 2008-09: 19 . 2009-10: 19 . 2010-11: 14 . 2011-12: 13 . 2012-13: 21 . 2013-14: 24 . 2014-15: 27 . The numbers may be warped by unusual goings on at Watford (four different managers this season) and Leeds (three) but this season is on course to create a new record of managerial departures, set at 46 in 2006-07. One of the most disturbing trends for the League Managers Association, which released these figures today as part of its quarterly review, is that those managers dismissed during the current campaign were only in their jobs for an average of 1.04 years. The average for those sacked in the top three tiers has been less than a year. Mark Yeates, fired from Cheltenham after nearly five years, and Paul Cox, who departed Mansfield after more than three, boosted the average tenure figures in League Two. Thirteen of the 27 dismissals have been managers serving for the first time in the top four divisions of English football. Will they return to the job? Really, why would you? Mansfield's Paul Cox was at the club for three years, bucking the trend for length of tenure .

chatgpt: In the world of football, managerial changes are not unusual. However, the first half of the 2014/15 season saw an unusually high number of changes. In fact, 34 managerial changes were made during this period alone. This statistic alone reflects the pressure that football managers are under to produce results and the rapidity with which they can be sacked. One team that has experienced significant upheaval is Watford. The team has had four different managers so far this season, with each departure coming as a surprise to fans and analysts alike. While some speculate that this volatility is due to poor performance on the pitch, others suggest that the Watford board is particularly stringent when it comes to their expectations of their managerial staff. Another team that has seen a number of changes is Leeds United, who have gone through three managers in the first half of the season. Once a powerhouse of English football, the team is now languishing in the Championship with an uncertain future. With owner Massimo Cellino facing suspension from the Football League and a possible takeover in the offing, the team's supporters have been left wondering what the future holds. Despite this uncertainty, one thing is clear: the average tenure for dismissed managers during the first half of the season was just 1.04 years. This statistic points to the precarious nature of football management and the need for constant performance improvements, particularly in the upper leagues where the stakes are highest. In fact, Neil Warnock was the first Premier League manager to be sacked this season, highlighting just how unforgiving the league can be. His dismissal from Crystal Palace was seen as a necessary move, given the club's poor form and Warnock's inability to turn things around. Overall, the first half of the 2014/15 season has been one of upheaval and uncertainty for many teams and managers. With the second half of the season looming, fans and analysts are waiting with bated breath to see what twists and turns the remainder of the season will bring.
