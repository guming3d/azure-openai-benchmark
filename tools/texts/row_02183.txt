According to a survey conducted by YouGov, 113 fans were asked about their preferences, revealing that the classic comedies One Foot in the Grave and 'Allo 'Allo! were among their favourite television shows.

Yesteryear artists such as Johnny Mathis and Wizzard were named as popular musicians by the respondents. It might be surprising to some to learn that Burnley fans appreciate classic television and music, but it's important to remember that many of these fans are likely of an older demographic. One Foot in the Grave originally aired from 1990 to 2000, and 'Allo 'Allo! aired from 1982 to 1992.

It's important to remember that even those who are passionate about sports have other aspects to their lives, and these results highlight that Burnley fans are no exception.

It's unclear whether any Burnley players or staff members share their fans' love of One Foot in the Grave and 'Allo 'Allo!, but it's possible that they appreciate the same classic shows and music.
