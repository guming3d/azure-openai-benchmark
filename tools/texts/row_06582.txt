For he has started his own one-man charitable enterprise by feeding scores of cats that have been orphaned as a result of the war. Alaa spends around $4 (£2.50) of his savings each day on meat to feed around 150 strays in Masaken Hanano, a neigbourhood in Aleppo.

Alaa says he has been feeding and taking care of the cats for over two months. Aleppo, the country's largest city, has been at the centre of some of the fiercest fighting since a major rebel offensive in July 2012.

The city is also being encircled by barbaric Islamic State militants who have captured swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq in their bid to create a caliphate across the two countries. It means the city could see an escalation in fighting if the Islamic fighters make their way into the city. The West is also intensifying its bombing campaign against the terror group. But some Syrians see the U.S-led strikes as serving Assad's interests because they do not target government forces and because some have hit the Nusra Front, Syria's Al Qaeda affiliate that has battled both the Islamic State and the president's forces. 'All of this is to serve Bashar, and yet people believe the Americans are protecting the Syrians,' said Saad Saad, writing on the same Facebook page.

chatgpt: In the war-torn city of Idlib, Syria, Alaa, a 33-year-old man, has been spending £2.50 a day on meat to feed the stray cats and dogs around his home. Despite the risks to his own safety, Alaa continues to provide food to the hundreds of animals left behind by their owners who have fled the area.  Alaa's neighbourhood was once a thriving community, but after years of shelling by pro-Assad forces, it now lies deserted. The only inhabitants left are the stray animals that wander the streets, scavenging for food to survive.  Alaa's love for animals started at a young age when he took in a stray kitten. Since then, he has dedicated his life to rescuing and taking care of stray animals. However, his efforts have intensified in recent years due to the ongoing conflict in Syria.  "Animals are innocent and they deserve better than what they are getting right now," Alaa said. "I couldn't just sit back and watch them suffer."  Every morning, Alaa wakes up early to buy meat from the local market. He then spends the rest of the day distributing the food to the stray animals in his neighbourhood. The cost of the meat, £2.50 a day, may not be much, but for Alaa, it means sacrificing his own daily needs.  Despite the dangers of living in a war zone, Alaa remains committed to his mission. He has witnessed the horrors of war firsthand, including the loss of his own family members. But for Alaa, the animals provide a much-needed escape from the chaos and destruction around him.  "Seeing these animals happy and healthy is the only thing that brings me peace and happiness," Alaa said.  Alaa's dedication has not gone unnoticed. Locals in the area have praised his efforts to care for the stray animals, calling him a "hero" for his selfless actions. However, his work is far from over. With so many animals without homes and basic needs, Alaa's daily efforts are just a drop in the bucket.  The situation in Idlib remains dire, with thousands of civilians forced to flee the area due to ongoing fighting. For Alaa, the only solace he finds in the devastation around him is in the animals he cares for.  "I hope my work inspires others to help these innocent creatures," Alaa said. "They deserve all the love and care in the world."  As Alaa continues to provide food and care to the stray animals in his neighbourhood, his story stands as a reminder of the resilience and humanity that still exists amidst the chaos of war.
