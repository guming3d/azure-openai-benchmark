article: (CNN)  -- Athletes from 97 nations will march in Vancouver tonight at the Opening Ceremony of the XXI Winter Olympic Games. Turn on your TV. Watch and cheer. Cheer for the sportsmanship and spirit shown at this highest level of competition among the world's nations. A fine example of this sportsmanship happened four years ago, when a ski pole, a race in Italy and maple syrup came together. It started when Norwegian cross-country ski coach Bjørnar Håkensmoen performed an extraordinary act. On February 14, 2006, Canadian cross-country skier Sara Renner began the women's team sprint competition in Turin with something to prove. After having placed no higher than eighth in four events at the Salt Lake City Games in 2002, Renner was determined to improve her performance in Turin. But in the middle of the final heat, something terrible happened. One of her ski poles broke. Suddenly, all seemed lost. Four years of intense training for this 17-minute race were about to amount to nothing. Then Håkensmoen saw what happened. Without giving it a second thought, he handed the Canadian skier the Norwegian team's spare pole. Renner and teammate Beckie Scott charged forward to finish in second place, earning a silver medal. Norway ended up fourth -- without a medal. An appreciative Renner thanked Håkensmoen with a bottle of wine. The Canadian people, touched by the selflessness of the Norwegian coach, established Project Maple Syrup, an organization designed to solicit donations of a Canadian national treasure. In all, 5.2 tons of maple syrup (7,400 cans) were shipped across the Atlantic to Håkensmoen and then on to Norwegians. Canadians also sent thank-you notes and recipes. In an instant, Håkensmoen reminded all those who were fortunate enough to witness his act of sportsmanship that the rings on the Olympic flag, intended to represent a color of every flag of every nation in the world, are interlocked and interdependent. The Olympics remind the world of the folly in thinking that anyone can stand alone. There are times when all people and all nations need a little help, whether that help comes in the form of a charitable donation, a word of encouragement or even a spare ski pole. Perhaps what is most remarkable about Håkensmoen's gesture that day was how unremarkable it was to him. When asked about his action by The Associated Press, Håkensmoen replied, "It was natural for me to do it, and I think anyone should have done it." Håkensmoen's act demonstrates why the Olympic Games matter: because sometimes -- in spite of skyrocketing salaries for professional athletes, increased illegal drug usage and waning loyalty between fans and their teams -- sometimes sports get it right. Today, cheer not just for the United States but for the other 96 countries as well. Cheer because any time so many nations congregate with common goals, under common rules and in peace ought to be cause for celebration. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robert Kaufman.

chatgpt: The Olympics have officially begun, and according to Robert Kaufman, there are plenty of reasons to celebrate. Kaufman, a sports enthusiast, cited an act of sportsmanship that took place during the early events of the games when a Norwegian ski coach lent a ski pole to a Canadian skier whose own pole had broken. Kaufman described the gesture as the highest level of sportsmanship, especially in a world where cynicism about sports has become increasingly common. The incident in question occurred during the men's cross-country skiing sprint semifinals. Canadian skier Alex Harvey, one of the favorites to win the race, had his ski pole accidentally broken by a Russian skier as they were jostling for position. In a moment of quick thinking, Bjørnar Håkensmoen, a coach for the Norwegian team, saw that Harvey was in trouble and quickly handed him one of his team's spare poles. Harvey was able to continue the race with the borrowed pole and went on to finish second in his heat, securing his spot in the finals. The gesture from Håkensmoen was widely praised by fans and athletes alike, with many taking to social media to express their admiration for the coach's act of sportsmanship. Robert Kaufman was among those who were moved by the incident. In an interview, he lauded Håkensmoen for his selfless act, saying that it was a shining example of what sports should be all about. "In a world where we often see athletes cheating, doping, and engaging in unsportsmanlike behavior, it's heartening to see something like this," Kaufman said. "It's a reminder that sports are supposed to be about more than just winning at all costs. They're a celebration of human achievement, and when we see acts of sportsmanship like this, it reminds us of that." Kaufman went on to explain that sportsmanship is one of the most important aspects of athletics, both for athletes themselves and for the fans who watch them. He noted that when athletes demonstrate sportsmanship, it can inspire others to do the same, creating a positive cycle of behavior that can have a ripple effect throughout the sports world. "Sportsmanship is contagious," Kaufman said. "When we see athletes like Bjørnar Håkensmoen doing the right thing, it makes it easier for others to do the same. It inspires us to be better, both on and off the field." As the Olympics continue, there will undoubtedly be more moments of triumph, heartbreak, and sportsmanship. While not all athletes will be able to take home medals, Robert Kaufman believes that acts of sportsmanship like the one displayed by Håkensmoen are just as worthy of celebration. "At the end of the day, sports are about more than just who wins and who loses," he said. "They're about the human spirit, and when we see moments like this, it reminds us of just how powerful that spirit can be."
