article: (CNN) -- Israel was founded on democratic principles with the Jewish state's declaration of independence in 1948 including a commitment to the "complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex." It has remained a continuous democracy ever since. The 120-seat Knesset is the Israeli seat of government. The seat of Israeli government is the Knesset, the country's national parliament, located in Jerusalem, which Israel claims as its capital. The Knesset's 120 lawmakers are elected by universal suffrage with all Israeli citizens over the age of 18 entitled to vote. Knesset seats are divided according to each party's proportion of the overall vote. But parties must poll at least two percent nationally to gain a seat. Participation in elections, including among Arab Israelis who constitute around 20 percent of the population, has traditionally been high at around 80 percent turnout, according to Israeli government figures. Israel currently has around 5.3 million eligible voters. Israel usually holds national elections every four years. But this year's poll on February 10 was called early -- less than three years since the last vote -- by Israeli President Shimon Peres following the resignation of prime minister Ehud Olmert amid allegations of corruption and his Kadima Party successor Tzipi Livni's failure to form a coalition. Olmert has continued to serve as caretaker prime minister in the interim. Coalitions of two or more parties are common in Israel; in fact no party has ever won enough votes to form a government by itself. Those remaining outside the ruling coalition make up the opposition. Thirty-four parties will participate in the 2009 elections, including major parties such as Kadima, Likud and Labor and also three Arab parties. The task of forming and leading a government is charged by Israel's president to the Knesset member and party leader considered to have the best chance of forming a viable coalition. The prime minister-designate then has 28 days, extendable by 14 days, to build a coalition commanding the support of at least 61 Knesset members. Officials results are due to be published on February 18 with the new Knesset convening on March 2.

chatgpt: Israel is set to hold national elections on February 10, with millions of eligible voters expected to cast their ballots across the country. The election will see 34 competing parties bidding for 120 seats in the Knesset, Israelâ€™s parliament. This comes after the collapse of the Kadima-led coalition, which led to the resignation of former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. The election is expected to be highly contested, with many citizens passionate about the future direction of the country. Longstanding issues such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the economy, and security will all be major factors in the election. The Knesset is made up of parties that span the political spectrum, with many allegiance forming around specific issues, including religious and regional divides. The two main parties competing in the election are the center-left Labor Party and the incumbent center-right Likud Party, led by current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Despite recent polling suggesting a Likud victory, the neck-and-neck race highlights an increasing interest in Israeli politics and a sense of polarizing issues. Recent right-wing legislation, such as the controversial Nation-State bill passed in 2018, have stoked tensions among the country's diverse population. This election will also be a pivotal moment for young Israeli voters, the majority of whom are under the age of 35. Many have been vocal in their desire for change, from urgent action on climate change to a more inclusive and equitable society. Furthermore, the ongoing friction with neighboring countries, including Iran and Syria, is expected to feature heavily in the campaign. Israel has long been a crucial regional player, and the future of its foreign policy will be of great importance to the region and beyond. As the results of Israel's election unfold, the world will be watching closely. This is a critical moment for the country and the region, and the outcome of this election will shape the future direction of the Israeli state.
