Girl Guides will no longer pledge their loyalty to God and country under radical changes revealed yesterday. Youngsters joining the Guides and Brownies will instead promise ‘to be true to myself’ and ‘serve my community’. The change ends more than a century of tradition and has caused an outcry from the Church of England and other religious groups. New pledge: Youngsters joining the Guides and Brownies will promise 'to be true to myself' and 'serve my community' Tradition: Although members have been required to make a pledge to God since its inception in 1910, the phrase 'and my country' has been included only since 1994 .

Christian Concern, herself a former Brownie, said: ‘This is a sad day. It runs against the tradition and history of the Guide movement, which . was rooted in Christian values. The change comes just a fortnight after a uniformed Guide leader took part in the service marking the 60th anniversary of the Queen's Coronation . ‘Now the promise sounds like a . self-help manual.’ But Chief Guide Gill Slocombe insisted the previous . oath had been ‘confusing’ about belief and ‘discouraged some girls and . volunteers from joining us’. The promise has been changed 11 times in the organisation’s history.

chatgpt: The Church of England has appealed to the Guides, a popular British scouting organization, to include all girls from different backgrounds by changing their pledge to God. The church's effort comes in response to the growing need of inclusion, especially for young girls from different faiths and cultures. The Guides have required members to make a pledge to God since 1910, a tradition that has been followed for over a hundred years. However, some leaders are now saying that different words are needed to be more inclusive of all members, regardless of their religion or beliefs. The Christian faith is the main foundation of the Guides' pledge, with members "promising to love God, serve the Queen and country, and help other people." Although some members feel that the pledge is an important part of the organization's culture and history, others believe that it excludes those members who do not share the Christian faith. This year, the Church of England has asked the Guides to keep the promise to God in their pledge but to consider adding alternative words or options for those who do not believe in God. This move has been welcomed by many members and leaders of the Guides. The Church of England's appeal is part of its continued efforts to promote a diverse and inclusive community. In a statement, the church emphasized the importance of creating an environment where all individuals can feel valued and included. The Guides have also acknowledged the need for inclusivity by introducing a new badge for girls who participate in Ramadan, a period of fasting and prayer observed by many Muslims. The badge is designed to celebrate diversity while recognizing the religious practices of members from different faiths. The inclusion of the new badge and the church's appeal for change in the pledge are steps towards creating a more inclusive community within the Guides. The organization has always been known for empowering girls, encouraging them to develop skills, and promoting leadership. By embracing diversity, the Guides are taking another step towards empowerment. Through the church's appeal, the Guides are urged to create a pledge that is more inclusive of its members from different faiths and cultures. This will not only make the Guides a more welcoming organization but will also teach members the importance of respecting each other's beliefs. While some members may feel that changing the pledge is unnecessary, it is important to consider the needs of those from different faiths and backgrounds. The Guides have the opportunity to demonstrate that inclusivity is not just about being politically correct but rather a way to promote unity and respect for all. In conclusion, the church's appeal to the Guides to create a more inclusive pledge is a welcome move. It reflects the changing needs of the community and the desire to promote diversity and inclusivity. The Guides have the opportunity to show that a diverse group of girls can come together and learn from each other while still recognizing their differences. By doing so, the Guides are setting an example for other organizations and promoting a more harmonious and accepting world.
