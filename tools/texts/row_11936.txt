article: By . Ted Thornhill . Last updated at 8:07 PM on 25th January 2012 . An incredible image of the Helix Nebula has been taken by a European Southern Observatory (ESO) telescope in Chile. The ESO likened the image to a ‘celestial firework display’, though the nebula is sometimes referred to as ‘They Eye of God’ by astronomers. The Helix Nebula is one of the closest and most remarkable examples of a planetary nebula. Cosmic beauty: An unusual view of the Helix Nebula taken by the ESO's VISTA telescope in Chile . It lies in the constellation of Aquarius -The Water Bearer - about 700 light years from Earth. This picture, taken in infrared light by the ESO’s 4.1-metre VISTA telescope at the Paranal Observatory, reveals strands of cold nebular gas that are invisible in images taken in visible light, as well as bringing to light a rich background of stars and galaxies. Planetary nebulae actually have nothing to do with planets – they are so-named because when they were first discovered in the 18th century they resembled planets when seen through early telescopes. They are composed of dust, ionised material and molecular gas that come from a dying star shedding its outer layers. This one is evolving to become a white dwarf star and appears as the tiny blue dot seen at the centre of the image. Heavens above: The VISTA telescope also captured this amazing picture of the star formation region Messier 8, often called the Lagoon Nebula, last year . Around it the gas and dust has formed an intricate flower-like pattern, glowing in the fierce glare of ultraviolet light from the central hot star. The powerful vision of ESO’s telescope reveals the fine structure in the nebula’s rings. The infrared light picks out how the cooler, molecular gas is organised. The material clumps into filaments that radiate out from the centre. Even though they look tiny, these strands of molecular hydrogen, known as cometary knots, are about the size of our Solar System. The main ring of the Helix is about two light-years across, roughly half the distance between the Sun and the nearest star. However, material from the nebula spreads out from the star to at least four light-years. This is particularly clear in this infrared view since red molecular gas can be seen across much of the image. The molecules in them are able to survive the high-energy radiation that emanates from the dying star precisely because they clump into these knots, which in turn are shielded by dust and molecular gas. It is currently unclear how the cometary knots may have originated.

chatgpt: NASA scientists have made an incredible discovery, finding a nebula that is 700 light years from Earth. The nebula is formed from a dying star shedding its outer layers, and it is truly a sight to behold. Astronomers and space enthusiasts everywhere are fascinated by this phenomenal discovery. The nebula, which has been named NGC 7027, has been studied for years by NASA scientists. It is one of the most visually stunning nebulas ever discovered, and it is believed to have formed from a dying star that has shed its outer layers. This process creates a beautiful, glowing cloud of gas and dust that is a true masterpiece of the universe. NGC 7027 is a young nebula that is located in the constellation of Cygnus. It is truly a work of art, with its intricate patterns and mesmerizing colors. The scientists who discovered the nebula used powerful telescopes to study it in detail, and they were amazed at what they found. One of the most fascinating things about NGC 7027 is that it is constantly changing. Because it is formed from a dying star, it is constantly shifting and evolving, with new patterns and shapes emerging all the time. This makes it a never-ending source of fascination for scientists and space enthusiasts alike. Scientists are now studying NGC 7027 to learn more about the process of star death, which is a crucial part of the life cycle of the universe. They hope that by studying nebulas like NGC 7027, they can gain a better understanding of how stars are formed, how they die, and how the universe as a whole evolves over time. NGC 7027 is not the only nebula that has been discovered in recent years, but it is one of the most fascinating. It is truly a breathtaking sight to see, and scientists are optimistic that studying it will lead to new discoveries and a greater understanding of the universe as a whole. It is truly remarkable that, even from 700 light years away, we can still see and study objects as incredible as NGC 7027. It is a testament to the incredible advances that scientists have made in the field of astronomy in recent years, and it is a reminder of the vastness and complexity of the universe that we live in. As technology continues to improve, it is likely that we will discover even more beautiful nebulas like NGC 7027 in the years to come. It is an exciting time to be a space enthusiast, and there is no telling what other incredible discoveries are waiting to be made.
