Marks & Spencer customers with a mighty appetite can now try to tackle the biggest steak available from the high street supermarkets. Called the Tomahawk, the steak weighs 2lb 8oz and is more than five times heavier than the average cut of meat – which are usually a less-daunting 7oz. Carnivore's dream: The Tomahawk steak is more than five times heavier than the average cut of meat . But at such a formidable size it remains to be seen whether the new prime cut of steak will be too much for Marks & Spencer customers to stomach. However, Tom Harvey, the company’s meat buyer, said he has high hopes that the new product will be a success when it becomes available online for the first time this weekend. Mr Harvey said: ‘I trialled the idea of the Tomahawk with my friends. When they saw it in my kitchen it had jaws hitting the floor, and there is now a waiting list of guests wanting to come and feast. 'We’re really looking forward to seeing our customers’ reactions and hope that this will be the ultimate dish for them to wow their dinner party guests with.’ Inspiration: The Tomahawk was named after the large Native American weapon of the same name . The £25 Aberdeen Angus rib steak is hand trimmed and sold with the entire rib bone left intact to enhance the flavour. It has been named the Tomahawk because it is said to resemble the large Native American weapon. The beef is from cattle reared in the UK and is matured for 28 days before it becomes available to order. Mr Harvey added: ‘Feasting on colossal slabs of well-reared, well-butchered meat is a simple guilty pleasure you can’t beat. 'We know our customers love eating our delicious steaks, and our Tomahawk really is the ultimate steak experience.’ M&S recommends cooking the steak by  frying it first and then browning it in the oven before serving. The Tomahawk steak is part of Marks & Spencer’s Food To Order online-only range featuring its own butchers and fishmonger service as an extension of its web-based entertaining range. And while the steak will offer the ultimate challenge to the committed carnivore, the supermarket does recommend that the Tomahawk should serve two to three people.
