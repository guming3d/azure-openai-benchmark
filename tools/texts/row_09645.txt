article: People diagnosed with ADHD are twice as likely to die prematurely than people without the disorder, according to new research. Those diagnosed as adults were more than four times as likely to die early compared with those without ADHD at the same age - while children diagnosed before the age of six years had around double the risk of early death. ADHD is a group of behavioural symptoms that include inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness. ADHD, commonly treated with Ritalin (pictured) is a group of behavioural symptoms that include inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness . It's the UK's most common behavioural disorder and an estimated two to five per cent of schoolchildren and young people are affected by it. The increased risk of early death was driven by deaths from unnatural causes, more than half of which were caused by accidents. The study, published in The Lancet, is the first to shed light on the role of ADHD in premature death. Dr Soren Dalsgaard of Aarhus University in Denmark said: 'Our findings emphasise the importance diagnosing ADHD early, especially in girls and women, and treating any co-existing antisocial and substance use disorders. 'It is however important to emphasise that although the relative risk of premature death is increased in ADHD, the absolute risk is low.' The large nationwide study followed nearly two million people from the Danish national registers, including more than 32,000 people with ADHD, from their first birthday to 2013, for a maximum of 32 years. The causes of premature death were then assessed to compare individuals with and without ADHD and found 107 with ADHD died. Previous research showed individuals with ADHD are more likely to have a range of co-existing disorders including oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, and substance use disorders. Commenting on the study, Professor of psychiatry Dr Stephen Faraone at The State University of New York Upstate Medical University said: 'For too long, the validity of ADHD as a medical disorder has been challenged. 'Policy makers should take heed of these data and allocate a fair share of health care and research resources to people with ADHD. 'For clinicians, early identification and treatment should become the rule rather than the exception. 'Although talk of premature death will worry parents and patients, they can seek solace in the knowledge that the absolute risk for premature death is low and that this and other risks can be greatly reduced with evidenced-based treatments for the disorder.' The findings also reveal that girls and women with ADHD have a higher relative risk of premature death compared with boys and men with ADHD.

chatgpt: A new study has revealed that people diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) face a higher risk of dying prematurely by unnatural causes. The research, carried out by Danish scientists over a period of 32 years, showed that those with ADHD were twice as likely to succumb to unnatural causes of death such as car crashes. The study's findings are particularly alarming, as ADHD is a common condition that affects millions of people worldwide. It is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention, making it difficult for individuals with the condition to stay organized and focused. The increased risk of unnatural deaths faced by ADHD sufferers could be attributed to the fact that they may be more impulsive and have a harder time controlling their actions. This can lead to reckless behavior, particularly when it comes to driving. Previous studies have shown that people with ADHD are more likely to get involved in traffic accidents and other incidents involving vehicles. The research also indicated that people with ADHD have a higher risk of dying from cardiovascular disease and suicide-related incidents. It is believed that the difficulty in regulating emotions and behavior experienced by people with the condition may contribute to these deaths. The authors of the study suggested that early intervention and treatment for ADHD could help reduce the risk of premature death. Earlier diagnosis of ADHD would allow for appropriate medication and behavioral therapies to be implemented, which could help reduce impulsiveness and inattention, and in turn, prevent accidents. The study's findings are significant, particularly as the number of people diagnosed with ADHD continues to rise. The condition affects approximately 5-7% of children and 2-5% of adults worldwide. With early diagnosis and treatment, the negative outcomes of ADHD can be decreased, and individuals with the condition can lead long and healthy lives. The study serves as a reminder of the importance of seeking professional help as soon as possible after noticing symptoms of ADHD. Symptoms may include difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, and frequently interrupting others. With a proper diagnosis and treatment plan, people with ADHD can gain greater control over their lives and reduce the risk of premature death. The study's authors noted that their findings suggest a need for more research and resources to be directed towards ADHD. By prioritizing this research area, we can hope to close the knowledge gap that exists around ADHD and find ways to better manage the condition. In conclusion, the study highlights the importance of early diagnosis and intervention for ADHD. With the right treatment, people with the condition can lead long, healthy, and fulfilling lives. It also highlights the need for continued research into ADHD to better understand the condition and provide effective treatment interventions.
