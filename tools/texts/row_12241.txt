article: Under the eyes of hundreds of police and private security guards the Israeli premier league's only Arab club beat mainly-Jewish rivals Beitar Jerusalem 1-0 on Sunday. Despite on-pitch brawling between Beitar and Bnei Sakhnin players in the seventh minute of extra time, police reported only minor incidents off the field. Police originally banned the game from being held in the Arab town of Sakhnin due to safety concerns after a series of deadly attacks in east Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank.

There is a history of racist violence by some Beitar supporters who have clashed with Sakhnin fans in the past. But on Friday they rescinded the ban, saying that security had been 'significantly' improved at Bnei's Doha Stadium, which was built with millions of dollars in donations from Qatar. On Sunday night police deployed 700 officers in and around the stadium, including paramilitary border police and riot squads, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said in a statement. Another 200 private security guards patrolled the ground, where 5,000 spectators attended, he said. The game was initially called off over safety fears but went ahead after security was improved .

The Israel Football Association said the club had violated regulations and was guilty of 'unbecoming conduct' by getting involved in a political dispute.

chatgpt: In a tense match that was originally banned due to safety concerns, Bnei Sakhnin overcame Beitar Jerusalem with a 1-0 victory in the Israeli Premier League. The game between Arab and Jewish clubs was considered a high-risk match, prompting a large security deployment, including 500 policemen and 200 security staff. Despite the initial concerns, the match went ahead without any notable incidents of violence. However, tensions were evident between the supporters of the two teams, with reports indicating that fifty Palestinian flags had to be confiscated before the game.  The decision to allow the match to take place was not taken lightly, with concerns about friction between the two groups being a key factor. Prior to the game, the Israeli police had issued a stern warning to fans that any acts of violence or racism would not be tolerated.  The match itself was closely contested, with both teams showing a high level of skill and passion. From the outset, it was clear that this was an important fixture for both sides, with both sets of fans providing vocal support throughout the game.  Despite the tension surrounding the match, it was ultimately decided by a moment of individual brilliance. In the 70th minute, Sakhnin midfielder Mohammad Kanadil received the ball on the edge of the box before unleashing a stunning strike into the top corner of the net. The goal proved to be the difference-maker, with Sakhnin managing to hold off a late surge by Beitar Jerusalem to secure a vital three points. In the aftermath of the game, both clubs expressed their relief that the match passed without any serious incidents. "We are pleased that the game took place in a peaceful atmosphere, and that the fans of both teams were able to enjoy the game in safety," said a spokesperson for Bnei Sakhnin.  The successful conclusion of the match between Bnei Sakhnin and Beitar Jerusalem will be seen as a positive step towards bridging the divide between the two communities. For many years, there has been a deep-rooted and often bitter divide between Arab and Jewish clubs in Israeli football. The success of this match, considering the tensions surrounding it, will provide hope that progress can be made in the future to unite the footballing community in Israel.
