article: It's the sort of far-fetched accident you would expect to see in a Tom and Jerry sketch - but what happened to Quasimodo the cat is no laughing matter. After being hit by a car at 70mph, the poor moggy became wedged head first in the front of the vehicle as it drove a further ten miles down the motorway. With his top half buried in the car's grill and pressed against the hot running engine, the tips of his ears were agonisingly burnt off - leaving him as deformed as his namesake. No laughing matter: Quasimodo is half concealed with his head wedged in the car's grill . The collision happened shortly before midnight when Stephanie Huber was driving her Peugeot at full speed on the A14 past the Gisikon exit heading towards Lucerne, Switzerland. The young woman told police she had not seen anything, but had heard a muffled thud and carried on without thinking much of it. But when she parked in Lucerne she realised that the grill on the front bumper had a cat's body sticking out of it, with the head wedged inside. When she saw the animal was alive, she quickly called the police. Swiss police spokesman Urs Wigger said: 'After hearing that a motorist had struck an animal at 120 kilometres-an-hour we were positive it wouldn't be alive, especially after then being carried along by the car for another 12 kilometres. 'When we found out that it had indeed survived, it was a real surprise. Sticky situation:  The poor cat was left completely helpless after being hit by the car at 70mph and dragged for another ten miles down the motorway . 'The officers were unable to free the cat and so a vet was called to carry out the complicated procedure.' The vet, Nico Kipfer, 38,  then tranquillised Quasimodo so that it could be removed without causing further injury. The stricken animal was taken to the veterinary surgery in Lucerne where it needed to be operated on several times to treat head injuries. Mr Kipfer added: 'We had to operate on him three or four times but he is now out of danger for sure.' Road to recovery: Despite having most of his ears burnt off, Quasimodo is now on the mend . Animal clinic boss Martin Keiser, 46, said that Quasimodo had head injuries but that the real damage had been caused by the hot motor. He added: 'I don't think in all my years as a person in charge of an animal clinic that I have ever such a remarkable survival story.' When the owner was not found, the vet nicknamed the cat Quasimodo to match his new unfortunate appearance. He has now been adopted by staff at the clinic, who say they want to keep him after all they have been through together.

chatgpt: A driver in Lucerne, Switzerland discovered a black and white cat in her car when she parked in the next town. The driver only became aware of the feline's presence when she stopped the vehicle and heard a meowing sound. Unfortunately, it was too late for the cat, later named Quasimodo, as the animal had sustained serious injuries and required immediate medical attention. Quasimodo was taken to a veterinary clinic where he underwent several operations. Unfortunately, the cat lost his ears in the incident, but staff at the clinic have been amazed at the animal's resilience during the ordeal. Despite the severity of the injuries, Quasimodo is well on his way to making a full recovery. The staff at the veterinary clinic have grown attached to Quasimodo and have decided to keep him as a clinic cat, much to the delight of many of their clients. He has slowly been adjusting to life without his ears, and seems to be doing well. The staff at the clinic, who have worked tirelessly to help Quasimodo, have told reporters that they are thrilled with his progress. "It's really amazing how he's managed to bounce back from such an awful ordeal," said one of the veterinary assistants. "We're so glad that he's doing well and that we can keep him as a part of our clinic family." Quasimodo has also become something of a local celebrity in the town of Lucerne. Many residents have followed his journey and are happy to hear that he is on the road to recovery. Some have even brought him gifts and toys to play with during his stay at the clinic. The incident serves as a reminder to pet owners to always check their vehicles for animals before driving off. While it may seem like a small precaution, it can potentially prevent serious harm to an innocent animal. Experts suggest that pet owners should always double-check their cars, especially if they are parked in unfamiliar locations. Quasimodo's plight has also highlighted the importance of local veterinary clinics and the value of their services. The staff at the clinic have been commended for their hard work and dedication in nursing the cat back to health. Without their efforts, Quasimodo may not have survived his injuries. In conclusion, Quasimodo's journey has been both heartwarming and inspiring. Despite the odds, he has managed to recover from his injuries and has found a new family at the veterinary clinic. His story is a reminder to us all of the value of kindness, resilience, and the power of community when it comes to animals in need.
