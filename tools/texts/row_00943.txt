article: NEW YORK (CNN) -- Perhaps he should be called Captain Phoenix? Captain America will return in a new comic book series July 1. Its title: "Captain America Reborn." Rising from the dead after being killed off over two years ago, Captain America is being resurrected by Marvel Comics. Though the circumstances of his return are being closely shielded, the star-spangled superhero returns July 1 in a five-comic-book series, "Captain America Reborn." A big-budget movie in development by Marvel is also expected in 2011. After close to 60 years in print, Marvel Comics killed off Steve Rogers, aka Captain America, in 2007, one of its most famous and beloved superheroes, amid a controversial story line. He fought and triumphed over Hitler, Tojo, international Communism and a host of super-villains, but a sniper's bullet cut Captain America down in 2007, a move that shocked many of his fans. "The reaction was amazing," says Marvel Executive Editor Tom Brevoort. "It certainly was like the world went crazy for three days. Everybody had a point of view about it, including fans who hadn't read the comic for 30 years." In the comic series, Rogers was to stand trial for defying a superhero registration law passed after a hero's tragic mistake causes a 9/11-like event. Marvel said the comic story line was intentionally written as an allegory to current real-life issues like the Patriot Act, the war on terror and September 11. Rogers eventually surrenders to police. He is later mortally wounded as he climbs the courthouse steps. It was a violent and strange end for an American hero and icon. The primary shooter, Crossbones -- working under the orders of Captain America's longtime nemesis, the Red Skull -- was caught. The identity of a second shooter is revealed in issue 600, which goes on sale Monday. Many felt Captain America's death in 2007 was symbolic of the time. And his return now? "The tenor of the world now is when we're at a point where we want to believe in heroes. Someone who can lead the way," said Brevoort. "It just feels like the right time." Captain America first appeared in 1941, just as the United States entered World War II. He was a symbol of American strength and resolve in fighting the Axis powers. As originally conceived by creators Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, Rogers was born before the Great Depression in a very different America. He disappeared after the war and only reappeared recently in the Marvel timeline. Keeping superheroes dead and buried does not come easy. Even Superman, who was killed off by DC Comics in 1993, came back to life a year later. And what of Captain America's sidekick, Bucky Barnes? After taking up the shield and mission of Captain America for the past year, it'll be time to relinquish the mantle. Is there room for two sentinels of liberty? Stay tuned.

chatgpt: Marvel Comics fans were pleasantly surprised to learn that Captain America, one of the most beloved superheroes, is set to make a comeback. The iconic character was killed off by Marvel over two years ago, leaving fans devastated. However, recent issues of Marvel comics have shed light on the suspicious circumstances behind Captain America's death, a mystery that has kept fans on the edge of their seats.  According to Marvel Comics editors, it's the right time to bring Captain America back. To many fans, it feels like a natural progression in the storyline. In the comics, Captain America has played an instrumental role in defending humanity against numerous threats over the years. When he was killed off in 2018, it was a shock to the system. Many fans of the character were left wondering if they would ever see him again. Through the various iterations of the character, Captain America has always embodied a sense of hope and justice. He is a symbol of all that is good in the world, fighting for what is right no matter the cost. The loss of such a powerful symbol in the Marvel Universe was felt deeply. But now, there's hope on the horizon. Marvel Comics has been slowly building up to Captain America's resurrection, revealing key pieces of the puzzle with each new issue. The pieces have been falling into place, giving fans a sense of closure surrounding the character's death. The storyline has been carefully crafted to ensure that the return of Captain America feels authentic and not abrupt. "While the storyline behind Captain America's death was compelling, it just feels like the right time to bring him back," a Marvel Comics editor said. "We're excited to see how fans react to his return, and we think they're going to be blown away by the next chapter in his story." Fans have already begun to speculate on how Captain America will make his return. Some have theories that involve interdimensional travel, while others think the character will be brought back to life through technological means. Whatever the case, it's clear that the Marvel Universe will never be the same. As for the question of why Captain America was killed off in the first place, it appears that the reasons were entirely plot-driven. The character's death allowed other storylines to develop, and it gave writers the freedom to explore new territory in the Marvel Universe. However, it's undeniable that his death was a significant blow to the Marvel community, and his resurrection is a chance for fans to revisit one of their favorite superheroes. The return of Captain America is undoubtedly something to look forward to for Marvel fans. His story has always been one of courage and hope in the face of adversity, and his resurrection will give fans a much-needed dose of optimism in these uncertain times. The Marvel Universe will be better with Captain America back in it, ready to defend the world against all threats, both big and small.
