chatgpt: Actor Jamie Dornan was at the center of a crime that occurred outside his $4 million East Village home in New York City. Dornan, who is best known for his role as Christian Grey in the "Fifty Shades" trilogy, witnessed an altercation between two men outside his property late Saturday night. According to reports, one man was trying to steal a bicycle from the other man when a fight broke out. Dornan called the police and turned over security footage from his home's surveillance cameras, which captured the entire incident. While this incident is concerning, it's not the first time that Dornan has made waves in the neighborhood. Last year, the Northern Irish actor caused controversy by knocking down the existing 160-year-old building on his property and building a new home in its place. Some residents in the community argued that the demolition of the historic building was a loss for the neighborhood's culture and architecture. However, Dornan defended his decision by stating that the previous structure was not structurally sound and had to be demolished for safety reasons. Despite the controversy, Dornan has been a popular member of the East Village community since he moved in several years ago. He is often seen walking his dog through local parks and has even donated to local charities. The recent crime outside his home is a reminder of the need for increased security measures in the area. Dornan's decision to install security cameras on his property allowed for the quick resolution of the altercation and should serve as an example for other homeowners in the neighborhood. The police are currently investigating the incident and have not released the identities of the two men involved. The altercation may have been a random occurrence, but the neighborhood is still on high alert as residents hope to prevent future crime in the area. As for Dornan, he has not commented on the incident and is likely focusing on his acting projects. The actor has several films in development and is set to star in a new HBO limited series later this year. Despite the recent crime outside his home, Dornan's star power in Hollywood shows no signs of dimming anytime soon.
