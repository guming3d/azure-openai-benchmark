chatgpt: Scotland will be without the services of midfielder James McArthur for their upcoming match against the Republic of Ireland due to injury. In addition, the Irish will also be without one of their own midfielders, James McCarthy, for the clash. This will be a major blow for both sides, as McArthur and McCarthy are key players for their respective teams. McArthur has been a regular member of Scotland's squad since making his debut in 2010, while McCarthy has been an important figure for the Republic of Ireland over the past few years. Despite the absence of McArthur, Scotland will be confident going into the game. The team has lost just one of their last nine international matches, and they will be looking to continue their good form against the Irish. Manager Alex McLeish will be counting on his team to step up and deliver a strong performance in McArthur's absence. Meanwhile, the Republic of Ireland will have to find a way to cope without McCarthy. The midfielder has been an important figure for them over the past few years, and his absence could leave a big hole in the team. However, manager Martin O'Neill will be hoping that his side can still find a way to get a positive result, especially as they have netted 90th-minute goals in their last two away games. This game is expected to be a closely contested affair, with both teams keen to secure a victory. Scotland will be looking to build on their recent good form, while the Republic of Ireland will be eager to bounce back from their disappointing defeat to Wales in their last international match. The absence of McArthur and McCarthy could have a big impact on the outcome of the game, but there are still plenty of other talented players on both sides who will be looking to make a difference. Fans can expect a hard-fought, entertaining match, with both teams giving their all to secure the win. Overall, this promises to be a fascinating encounter between two evenly matched sides. It will be interesting to see how both teams cope without their key midfielders, and which side is able to come out on top. Fans of both teams will be hoping for an exciting and memorable game that will live long in the memory.
