chatgpt: Manchester United's Jesse Lingard suffered an injury scare during their opening game of the season against Swansea City. The midfielder was forced off the pitch on Saturday after colliding with Ashley Williams in the 24th minute of the match. Lingard hurt his right leg on impact, and had to be replaced by Adnan Januzaj. This news comes as a blow for manager Louis van Gaal, who is already concerned about the fitness of several of his players. Van Gaal had hoped that Lingard could play a crucial role for United this season after his impressive performances in pre-season. The 21-year-old was pictured leaving Bridgewater Hospital on Sunday with crutches, and his leg in a cast. It is unclear how long Lingard will be out for, but it is believed that he could miss up to three weeks of action. Lingard's injury is just the latest setback for van Gaal, who is already without the likes of Luke Shaw, Marcos Rojo, and Ashley Young. United were also without Sergio Romero and Antonio Valencia for their opening game, meaning that they had to field a weakened starting eleven. Despite taking the lead through Juan Mata, United ended up falling to a 2-1 defeat to Swansea in their opening game of the season. Goals from Andre Ayew and Bafetimbi Gomis sealed the victory for the Welsh side, who looked dangerous on the counter-attack throughout. Next up for United is a trip to the Stadium of Light to face Sunderland on Sunday. Van Gaal will be hoping that his side can bounce back from their opening day defeat, but will be aware that injuries could once again play a major role in the outcome of the match. It remains to be seen how long Lingard will be out for, but his absence will certainly be felt by United. The midfielder has shown great potential in his brief career so far, and will be eager to get back on the pitch as soon as possible.
