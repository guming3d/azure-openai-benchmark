article: (CNN) -- World heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko has told reporters that he believes rival David Haye is only bluffing with his threats to quit boxing in October. International Boxing Federation (IBF) and World Boxing Organization (WBO) champion Klitschko will defend his titles against Dereck Chisora on April 30, prompting World Boxing Association (WBA) champion Haye to announce that the unification fight between the duo will now not happen because he intends to retire when he turns 31 later this year. But Ukrainian Klitschko has poured scorn on Haye's claims, saying: "This is total nonsense and he is playing the media. "He will not retire because he is a liar. He has no legacy whatsoever from boxing -- beating Audley Harrison has not given him a legacy. "David Haye has accomplished nothing in the heavyweight division other than to present himself with his stupid t-shirt and comments," Klitschko continued. "This guy will eventually fight me because everything coming out of his mouth is a lie, but if he does retire, he will be a loser with no legacy in the heavyweight division at all." Haye made the comments after Klitschko chose to honor an agreement to face the Briton's compatriot Chisora, in a fight that was postponed from last year after Klitschko suffered a back injury in training. However, Klitschko maintains that if he beats Chisora, he can still fight Haye later in the year. The Ukrainian added: "I don't need a half a year to prepare for Haye. Me facing Chisora first is good promotion for the fight because the guy is also British and also very loud." Haye could be forced to fight mandatory WBA challenger and former world champion Ruslan Chagaev, with a preliminary date set for July 2, although Klitshcko maintains that could be side-stepped. "I don't take David Haye as a super-special fight. I'm always in shape anyway. He could give Chagaev step-aside money and then I'm going to be there with nobody to fight," continued Klitschko. "Because of our history before, I would fight him on July 2 and we would work on the contract, but I would still fight Chisora first."

chatgpt: Wladimir Klitschko, former heavyweight world champion, has dismissed the recent threats by David Haye to retire in October without ever facing him in the ring. Klitschko suggests that Haye is merely bluffing, as this isn't the first time the Briton has made such a claim. Haye's retirement threat comes after Klitschko announced his next opponent, Dereck Chisora, for a scheduled fight in April. The announcement did not sit well with Haye, who has been eager for a rematch with Klitschko since their last bout in 2011. Klitschko dismissed Haye's claims, saying that Haye is using the same tactic he used before their last fight, by creating an artificial scarcity of fights. Klitschko believes that Haye will not retire, but will instead look for other opportunities if he cannot arrange a fight with Klitschko. Haye, who retired in 2018 but returned to the ring in 2020, appeared to double down on his retirement threat in a statement released earlier this week. The statement reiterated Haye's claims that he will retire in October if he does not get a fight with Klitschko before then. For his part, Klitschko remains focused on his upcoming fight with Chisora, a young and motivated fighter who has been making waves in the boxing world. Klitschko is eager to prove that he is still a force to be reckoned with, and that retirement is not yet on his radar. Despite the back-and-forth between the two fighters, it remains unclear whether a rematch between Haye and Klitschko will ever happen. Both fighters have their own priorities, and it remains to be seen whether they will be able to come together for one final bout. If Haye does retire, he will leave behind a complex legacy in the sport. While he was undoubtedly one of the most dynamic and exciting heavyweights of his time, he was also criticized for his trash-talking and his unwillingness to fight the best in the world. His retirement threat may be seen as yet another example of his unwillingness to take on the best fighters in the world. In the meantime, Klitschko remains focused on his upcoming fight with Chisora, and is determined to prove his critics wrong once again. It may be a long road to retirement for the Ukrainian legend, but he is proving that he still has plenty of fight left in him.
