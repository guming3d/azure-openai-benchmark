Katherine Jennings, 33, was arrested in Charlotte on Tuesday and taken across the state to Brunswick County to face charges in the death of Luke Stephen Phillips. Luke was eight months old when he died on December 13, 2013 while Jennings lived in Oak Island, near Wilmington, North Carolina. Medical examiners ruled the infant's death an accident, finding that he suffocated while he was sleeping with Jennings. Katherine Jennings, 33, had two sons die while she was sleeping with them in an 18 month time span - the last in December 2013 . In June 2012,  Jennings' first son, James Robert 'Bo' Phillips, died when he was four months old. That death was ruled an accident, but later the cause was changed to 'undetermined.' The medical examiner said the fact that he had been sleeping with Jennings was a factor in his death. Co-sleeping - the practice of infants sleeping with their parents - is a contentious issue in America. Most parents say they do it at least sometimes. However, many cases of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome that are reported every year actually show signs of being suffocation deaths from sleeping. The American Academy of Pediatrics says infants should be put to sleep in a crib with no blankets or pillows. Experts say parents can accidentally suffocate their children while they are sleeping - and never realize until it's too late. According to the Charlotte Observer, Jennings told police that when her second son, Luke, died, he was laying face up in her arms. Booked: Jennings was arrested in Charlotte and taken across the state to Wilmington, where she was charged with manslaughter . Brunswick County Assistant District Attorney Lee Bollinger told MailOnline he has never prosecuted a co-sleeping case before. He told MailOnline: 'She’s had two infants die and so that automatically makes this case different from folks who have an isolated incident of a child’s death.' He declined to say, however, exactly what factors went into deciding to charge Jennings. Jennings' husband, Seth Phillips, serves in the Coast Guard and was not home when either child died, according to the newspaper. The couple also have a four-year-old daughter. The Observer reports that Jennings has at least four arrests for drunk driving in her native Georgia, including one in 2007.

chatgpt: In a shocking development, Katherine Jennings, a 33-year old woman, has been arrested in Charlotte for her alleged involvement in the death of 8-month-old Luke Phillips. The infant reportedly died while sleeping with the accused in December 2013, under circumstances eerily similar to that of James 'Bo' Phillips, who died in June 2012 at the tender age of four months. The tragic and disturbing incidents have left the family of the children devastated and heartbroken. According to reports, both incidents occurred while the infants were sleeping with Jennings, who was entrusted with their care. The causes of death are yet to be established, but the authorities suspect that it could be due to suffocation or accidental smothering. The circumstances surrounding the deaths of Bo and Luke have raised concerns about infant sleep safety and the need for caregivers to exercise caution and vigilance. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all infants should be placed to sleep on their backs in a crib or playpen with no soft objects, toys, or loose bedding around them. Investigators have not revealed how the accused came to be in the position where the infants died. However, the case has sparked debate about the use of co-sleeping as a method of child-rearing. Some parents have advocated for it as a way to bond with their babies and promote closeness, while others have warned that it can be dangerous and lead to tragic outcomes. The news of Jennings' arrest has sent shockwaves through both the community and the families of the deceased. While the legal system will take its course, the bigger question remains: how can such tragedies be prevented in the future? It is essential that all caregivers, whether family members or professionals, familiarize themselves with safe practices for infant sleep. This includes providing a safe and secure sleeping environment and ensuring that infants are placed on their backs. Experts also advise against the use of soft surfaces, such as adult beds, couches, or chairs, as a place for babies to sleep. As the investigation into the tragic deaths of Bo and Luke Phillips continues, our thoughts and prayers are with their families. This is a stark reminder of the need to prioritize the safety and well-being of our most vulnerable in our homes and communities.
