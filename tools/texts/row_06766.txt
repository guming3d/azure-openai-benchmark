article: By . Chris Pleasance . While most bank robbers might have chosen a balaclava or a more traditional pair of tights to keep their faces hidden during a raid, this thief had other ideas. Instead he strolled into a branch of Barclays with blue masking tape over his face before demanding money from shocked cashiers. Staff handed over bags of notes before the criminal jumped into a metallic green Peugeot estate parked in a service road behind the bank. It's a sticky-tape up: Police are hunting this man who raided a branch of Barclays while wearing blue masking tape around his face as a disguise . Officers say the man escaped with a quantity of bank notes before jumping into a metallic green Peugeot estate car parked at the back of the building . However, a pouch of red dye is then believed to have exploded inside the car, covering the interior and the crook, showing that forward planning is perhaps not his strongest suit. The raid took place at Barclays Bank in Wallisdown in Poole, Dorset, at around 10am on Thursday. Detective Sergeant Dave Colomb, of Dorset Police, said: 'Following enquiries I am now able to release CCTV images of the suspect. 'Even though his faced is disguised it is hoped that someone may recognise him by his clothing and stature. 'It is believed that a security pack containing red dye discharged over the suspect shortly after the robbery. If anyone has seen this man with red dye on his clothing they are urged to contact the police urgently. The raid happened on Thursday at around 10am at this branch of Barclays in Wallisdown, Dorset .

chatgpt: The Metropolitan Police have launched a manhunt for a suspect who robbed a branch of Barclays bank in London yesterday afternoon. According to reports, the suspect made away with a significant amount of cash after threatening bank staff with a firearm. CCTV footage shows the robber wearing blue masking tape across his face as a disguise, leaving only his eyes visible. He is seen entering the bank at around 3 pm, brandishing a gun and demanding money from the terrified bank tellers. After taking the cash, the suspect made his getaway in a metallic green Peugeot car parked outside the bank. Despite a swift response from police, the car was not found at the scene. The suspect is described as a white male, approximately six feet tall, and of a slim build. He was reportedly wearing a black hoodie, dark trousers, and black gloves at the time of the robbery. Officers are appealing to witnesses who may have seen the suspect, particularly anyone who may have seen the metallic green Peugeot car leaving the scene. They are also urging anyone with information to come forward to assist with the investigation. Detective Inspector Sarah Morris of the Metropolitan Police said, "This was a terrifying incident which left staff members understandably shaken. We are doing everything in our power to bring the perpetrator to justice and are appealing to the public for any information they may have." Barclays Bank has confirmed that none of their staff members were harmed during the robbery, and are offering support and counseling to those affected. This is not the first time a bank has been targeted by robbers in the UK. In 2019, a record 122 banks were robbed in England and Wales alone, with the majority of offenders using intimidation tactics rather than violence. The latest incident has once again raised concerns about the safety of bank staff and customers, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic when many banks are operating with reduced staffing levels. Police are continuing their search for the suspect and are urging anyone with information to come forward. Anyone who sees the suspect is advised not to approach him and to call 999 immediately.
