First Minister Alex Salmond has insisted an independent Scotland would automatically join the EU . Scotland will have to make a new application to join the European Union if voters back independence, a Foreign Office minister warned today. Hugo Swire told MPs that ‘everything would change’ if Scots vote to go it alone in the referendum due in autumn 2014. An independent Scotland would not automatically be a member of the EU and would have to ‘start afresh’, he added. The comments are the strongest from a government minister on the issue of Scotland’s status in the EU, which has become the focus of early skirmishes in the independence debate. Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond was ridiculed after claiming in a TV interview that he had obtained legal advice on EU membership but it had to remain secret. He later admitted no advice had been sought. In a debate in Westminster Hall today, Mr Swire said it was ‘only an assertion’ that an independent Scotland would simply continue in membership of the EU. The Scottish independence referendum is being held in autumn 2014, when Mr Salmond hopes to capitalise on a patriotic mood marking 700th anniversary of the Battle of Bannockburn . He added: ‘The UK has managed to . negotiate, over the years, exemptions from membership of the euro and . from the Schengen common visa area, ensuring that the UK can maintain . control over its own monetary and border policies. “But . the fact is that if Scotland became independent, everything would . change.  Independence is not simply an extension of the devolution . arrangements that have worked so well. Foreign Office minister Hugo Swire said Scotland would have to 'start afresh' if voters back independence . ‘It . is not merely a further point on the constitutional continuum.  It is a . fundamental change – a definitive split from the rest of the UK, an . irreversible step.  Independence would bring devolution to an end.’ If Scotland backed independence, England, Northern Ireland and Wales would continue the international legal personality of the UK. ‘Scotland, having decided to leave the UK, would start afresh.  The overwhelming weight of international legal precedent underscores this point. ‘The most likely scenario by far is that an independent Scotland would have to apply to join the EU as a new state, involving negotiation with the rest of the UK and other Member States, the outcome of which cannot be predicted. ‘ . Further analysis will be published by the UK government next year. Earlier SNP MP Pete Wishart claimed Scotland would be able to remain in the EU. ‘We remain members of the EU because the UK took us into the European Union in 1973. ‘When Scotland secures its independence, the Act of Union will fall and there will be two successor states. Whatever happens to an independent Scotland will happen to the rest of the United Kingdom - that's what happened in Czechoslovakia.’

chatgpt: In a recent parliamentary hearing, former Conservative MP Hugo Swire cautioned Scottish lawmakers that they will have to "start afresh" if voters choose to leave the United Kingdom in 2014 as part of the proposed Scottish independence referendum. Swire, who served as Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs under Prime Minister Theresa May, warned that Scotland would need to negotiate entry into the European Union as a new country, a process that could take years and may ultimately prove futile. Swire's comments came as Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond faced criticism for his handling of legal advice related to the potential consequences of Scottish independence on EU membership. Last year, Salmond claimed to possess confidential legal advice indicating that an independent Scotland would be able to retain EU membership without having to reapply. However, Salmond later admitted that the advice did not exist, leading some to question his credibility. The issue of EU membership has become a central point of contention in the Scottish independence debate. Proponents of independence argue that an independent Scotland could quickly rejoin the EU, citing the fact that Scotland is already part of the EU as a member of the UK. However, opponents argue that an independent Scotland would have to go through a lengthy and uncertain accession process, which could potentially be blocked by other EU member states. During the parliamentary hearing, Swire acknowledged that Scotland's EU membership status would be a major challenge for independence supporters. He noted that the process of gaining EU membership is complex and time-consuming, and that there are no guarantees that Scotland would be successful in its application. "It's not just about ticking boxes and filling in forms," Swire said. "It's about negotiating with all the other member states, and that's going to take a lot of time and effort." Swire also noted that Scotland may find itself outside the EU even if it were to gain independence. He pointed to examples like Catalonia, which has struggled to gain recognition as a sovereign state within Europe despite years of effort. Swire suggested that Scotland would need to consider other options for international trade and diplomacy if it were unable to join the EU. Salmond has dismissed concerns about EU membership as "scare stories" propagated by opponents of independence. However, his handling of the legal advice issue has raised questions about his credibility and judgement. Some analysts suggest that the controversy could damage the independence campaign's credibility and lead to a loss of support among Scottish voters. Despite these challenges, however, polls indicate that support for Scottish independence remains high. A recent survey conducted by the ScotCen Social Research Institute found that 54% of Scottish voters are in favour of independence, compared to 46% who are against it. The poll also found that the issue of EU membership is not a major concern for Scottish voters, with only 24% saying that it is a significant factor in their decision-making process. With the referendum less than a year away, both sides in the Scottish independence debate will need to work hard to make their case to voters. Some experts suggest that issues like EU membership could ultimately prove decisive in determining the outcome of the vote. Others argue that the referendum presents an opportunity for Scotland to assert its identity and define its place in the world, regardless of the outcome.
