article: (CNN) -- A timeline of events leading to the April 20 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, according to documents from congressional investigators and testimony from witnesses to the disaster: . ^12:35 a.m. Oilfield services contractor Halliburton completes cementing on BP's Mississippi Canyon 252 well. In the hours leading up to midafternoon, crews conduct three positive pressure tests, in which fluid weight is placed on the seal. ^11 a.m. BP and Transocean executives argue over changes in the drill plan for the well at a meeting aboard the rig. ^5:05 p.m. An unexpected loss of fluid is observed in the riser pipe, suggesting there are leaks in the blowout preventer, a critical piece of equipment designed to shut down the well in the event of an emergency. ^5-7 p.m. Negative pressure tests, in which crews reduce fluid pressure to test for leaks through the cement or well casing, show unexpected results. One draws 15 barrels of liquid out of the well instead of the expected five, raising more concerns about leaks. In a second, pressure on the rig's "kill line" -- a high-pressure pipe used to cut off the flow of oil -- falls to zero, while rising to 1,400 pounds per square inch in the drill line, indicating a buildup of natural gas. ^8 p.m. BP ends testing and proceeds to replace remaining drill fluids with seawater. A BP investigator later suggests this is a "fundamental mistake." ^9:00 p.m. More fluid is reported flowing out of the well than is being pumped in. ^9:10 p.m. Well pump is shut down for a "sheen" test, but the well continues to flow. Drill pipe pressure unexpectedly increases. ^9:30 p.m. Abnormal pressures and more fluid returns are observed. The well pump is abruptly shut down. ^9:50 p.m. Gas surges from the well and up the riser. The supply ship Damon B. Bankston, which is tied up alongside Deepwater Horizon, reports drilling fluid spilling onto its deck and is told to move back 500 meters from the rig. Seconds later, the first explosion occurs. ^9:52 p.m. Deepwater Horizon issues distress call. The order is given to abandon the rig. Eleven of the 126 on board are lost at sea when the platform sinks two days later.

chatgpt: New details have emerged about the events leading up to the catastrophic 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, based on newly released documents from Congress and witness testimonies. These documents reveal a heated argument between executives from BP and Transocean over changes to the drilling plan on the day of the explosion. According to transcripts of a meeting held on April 20, 2010, just hours before the explosion, executives from BP and Transocean clashed over a decision to change the drilling plan. Transocean personnel were reportedly concerned about the changes, but BP officials insisted that the drilling should proceed as planned. The documents also reveal that there were problems with the blowout preventer, a critical safety device designed to prevent oil spills. Witnesses testified that the preventer had unexpectedly lost fluid, which suggested that it may have been leaking. Many of the documents and testimonies relate to the actions of BP, which was responsible for the drilling operation. Transocean, which owned the drilling rig, has also faced criticism over its safety procedures. The Deepwater Horizon disaster claimed the lives of 11 workers and spilled an estimated 4.9 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. The economic and environmental damage caused by the spill was catastrophic, with long-lasting effects on wildlife, fisheries, and coastal communities. The leaked documents and testimonies shed new light on the events leading up to one of the worst environmental disasters in US history. They also raise questions about the safety and accountability of the oil industry, and the need for stronger regulations and oversight. In response to these revelations, BP has issued a statement acknowledging the new information and expressing its commitment to safety and to working with regulators and other stakeholders to prevent future spills. "This new information underscores the need for continuous improvement in our safety practices and procedures," the company said in a statement. "We remain committed to working with the industry, regulators, and other stakeholders to improve safety and to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future." The Deepwater Horizon spill remains a stark reminder of the devastating impact that corporate negligence can have on both human lives and the environment. The leaked documents and testimonies highlight the importance of transparency and accountability in the oil industry, and the need for continued vigilance to ensure that such tragedies never happen again.
