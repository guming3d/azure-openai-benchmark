article: (CNN) -- The English Premier League has decided to dispense with the traditional pre-match handshakes before Sunday's clash between Chelsea and Queens Park Rangers due to the legal case involving John Terry and Anton Ferdinand. Chelsea captain Terry is accused of racially abusing QPR defender Ferdinand during a match between the two teams at Loftus Road back in October. At a preliminary hearing in February, Terry's lawyer entered a not guilty plea and the judge decided to adjourn the case until July 9 -- after the Euro 2012 finals. After the case was put back, Terry was stripped of the England captaincy, triggering the turn of events that eventually led to Fabio Capello's resignation as coach. But ahead of the two players coming face-to-face at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge stadium, the Premier League has decided to abandon their usual pre-match ritual, given the legal complexities involved. A statement on their official website read: "The Premier League position on the pre-match handshake convention remains consistent. In all normal circumstances it must be observed. "However, after discussions with both Chelsea and Queens Park Rangers about the potential and specific legal context in relation to John Terry and Anton Ferdinand the decision has been taken to suspend the handshake convention for Sunday's match." When the teams met in the English FA Cup in January, the Football Association dispensed with the pre-match handshake to "diffuse further tensions." The handshake ritual caused huge controversy earlier in the Premier League season when Liverpool's Uruguayan striker Luis Suarez refused to shake the hand of Manchester United's French defender Patrice Evra. This was after Suarez had been banned for eight games by the Football Association after being found guilty of racially abusing Evra in an earlier match. Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson called Suarez a "disgrace" after the game. The striker later apologized, as did his club. Terry has remained Chelsea captain and was part of the side that made it into the European Champions League final at the expense of Barcelona on Tuesday, though he was sent off for an off the ball incident and will miss the final against Bayern Munich on May 19.

chatgpt: In a significant development ahead of the high-stakes Premier League match between Chelsea and Queens Park Rangers, the League has announced that pre-match handshakes have been dispensed with for this particular encounter. This move comes after Chelsea's John Terry was charged with using racist language towards QPR defender Anton Ferdinand during a Premier League game in October last year. The incident had caused immense controversy and had divided people's opinions on the severity of Terry's alleged "racist slur". Terry had steadfastly denied the charges leveled against him and insisted that he had used the words as an insult, rather than anything racist. Despite his protestations, the Football Association had taken a dim view of the situation and had stripped Terry of his England captaincy in February this year. This had caused an uproar amongst football fans worldwide, with many claiming that Terry had been unfairly treated. This latest development of scrapping pre-match handshakes for the Chelsea-QPR game is being viewed by many as a way of ensuring that the focus remains on the game itself rather than on the off-field controversies. Many people have strong views on this matter. Some believe that Terry's alleged actions were unacceptable and should not be tolerated in any form. Others have a more nuanced view of the situation and believe that Terry has been unfairly maligned by the media and that he deserves the benefit of the doubt. Chelsea has not issued any official statement on this matter yet. However, many of their fans have been quick to criticize the decision to scrap pre-match handshakes, with some branding it as an overreaction to a situation that has been blown out of proportion. It remains to be seen how this decision will impact the game itself. However, one thing is for sure, there will be plenty of attention on John Terry when he steps out onto the pitch at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. All eyes will be on him, and he will be hoping to let his football do the talking rather than his off-field controversies.
