chatgpt: In a shocking incident, a family of three was brutally attacked by a mob near the city of Xi'an in western China's Shaanxi province for refusing to move out of their home. An Lu's parents had refused to vacate their property to make way for a construction project. Other families in the area had already accepted compensation and moved out, but the An family held out. This decision led to a vicious attack on the family home that left the daughter in hospital in an artificial coma and fighting for her life. The attack, which occurred a few days ago, has left the An family reeling in shock and disbelief. According to eyewitnesses, a group of around 30-40 people gathered outside the family's home and started throwing stones and other objects at the property. When the family refused to open the door, the mob broke it down and stormed inside. They then beat the family with sticks and other weapons, causing serious injuries. An Lu, who was studying to become a teacher, is currently in hospital in an artificial coma. Her parents were also injured in the attack but have been discharged from hospital. The attack has been widely condemned by people across China, with many expressing their shock and outrage at the brutal nature of the assault. Speaking to reporters, the An family's neighbours expressed their concern and shock at the incident. "We are all scared now," said one neighbour. "If they can do this to the An family, what will they do to us if we refuse to move out?" The local authorities have promised to take strict action against those responsible for the attack. "We condemn this brutal attack and assure the family of our full support," said a government spokesperson. "We will take strict action against those responsible for this heinous crime." However, some have criticised the government's role in the attack, claiming that they have failed to protect the rights of property owners. "The government should ensure that people's rights are protected," said one commentator. "This attack is a clear violation of the law and it is the government's responsibility to make sure that justice is done." The incident has once again highlighted the issue of forced evictions in China. While the country has made progress in recent years in protecting the rights of property owners, cases of forced evictions continue to occur. The An family's refusal to move out of their home may have been their legal right, but it has come at a heavy price. As for An Lu, her family and friends continue to pray for her recovery. The attack has left her in a critical condition, and doctors say it may be some time before she is able to fully recover. In the meantime, the An family is receiving support from their neighbours and the wider community, who have come together to condemn this senseless act of violence.
