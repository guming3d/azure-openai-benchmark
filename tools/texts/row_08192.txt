article: (CNN) -- More then three years after a suspected cop killer died while in solitary confinement at a Maryland jail, a federal grand jury Thursday indicted a former jail guard in connection with the case. Anthony McIntosh, 48, a former corporal at the Prince George's County Detention Center outside of Washington, is charged with deprivation of civil rights and falsifying records in the June 29, 2008, death of Ronnie White. Prosecutors allege McIntosh failed to call for medical attention when he found White unresponsive in his cell. They also accuse him of attempting to cover up his involvement in the matter. White, 19, had been arrested two days earlier, charged with first-degree murder for allegedly running down Prince George's County Police Cpl. Richard Findley with a stolen truck. White passed a physical examination when he was admitted to the jail, was checked regularly in his solitary confinement cell, and was fine at 10:15 a.m. the day of his death, authorities said at the time. But when guards brought him his lunch 20 minutes later, he had no pulse. Initially, authorities said there was no sign of visible trauma to White, but an autopsy later revealed he died of asphyxiation and had two broken bones in his neck. Experts said it is virtually impossible for a person to strangle himself with his own hands. Seven corrections officials and an unspecified number of supervisors were the only ones authorized to be in White's cell, authorities said. Community leaders at the time decried White's death as "vigilante justice," and many voiced suspicions that jailers had killed him. The indictment sidesteps the question of who, if anyone, killed White. But it says that McIntosh discovered White in his cell unresponsive, but "walked away without providing medical care" or notifying anyone. McIntosh thereby acted "with deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of harm to (White), and resulting in bodily injury to, and the death of (White)," the indictment reads. That inaction deprived (White) of his constitutional rights, which includes an inmate's right "to be free from a correctional officer's deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs," the indictment said. McIntosh later concealed material facts when he wrote up incident reports, the indictment says. Specifically, McIntosh stated in his report that a corporal informed him White was unresponsive in his cell, but omitted that McIntosh had previously discovered him unresponsive and had left without notifying anyone. McIntosh was arrested Thursday in New York City by the FBI, the Department of Justice said. McIntosh faces a maximum penalty of life in prison for the civil rights offense. He faces up to 20 years in prison on each of two counts of falsification of records. The maximum fine for each count is $250,000. CNN was unable to identify and contact an attorney representing McIntosh. The case is being investigated by the Baltimore Division of the FBI and is being prosecuted by the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice.

chatgpt: Anthony McIntosh, a 48-year-old corrections officer at the Mayland Correctional Institution in Maryland, has been charged with depriving an inmate of his civil rights and falsifying records. The charges stem from an incident that occurred on June 29, 2018, when McIntosh allegedly found an inmate, Ronnie White, unresponsive in his cell and failed to report it. According to the indictment, McIntosh discovered White unresponsive during a routine check of the cells. However, instead of immediately notifying the medical staff or calling for emergency assistance, McIntosh allegedly did nothing. He then falsified records to make it appear as though he had checked on the inmate regularly throughout his shift. When White was eventually discovered, it was too late. An autopsy revealed that he had died from asphyxiation and had suffered broken bones in his neck. The autopsy report also noted that there were injuries to White's face and neck, suggesting that he may have been physically restrained prior to his death. The charges against McIntosh include one count of deprivation of rights under color of law, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, and one count of falsifying records, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. McIntosh was arrested on Tuesday, and his initial appearance is scheduled for Wednesday afternoon. The case highlights the ongoing problem of abuse and neglect within the prison system. According to a report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, there were 3,359 allegations of staff sexual misconduct against inmates reported between 2009 and 2011, and that's just the reported cases. The same report found that there were 7,444 allegations of excessive use of force by staff during the same time period. As for Ronnie White's family, they have been left to grieve the loss of their loved one and are calling for justice to be served. "We want to see justice done," said White's mother. "We want to see Anthony McIntosh held accountable for what he did to my son. He should have been looking out for him, not neglecting him." The case is also raising questions about the need for better training and accountability within the prison system. "This tragedy highlights the urgent need for better training of corrections officers and greater accountability for those who abuse their power," said Sheila Jackson Lee, a member of the House Judiciary Committee. The Baltimore Sun editorial board also weighed in on the case, calling for a full investigation into the incident and for reforms to be made to ensure that inmates are treated with dignity and respect. "We should be outraged by Mr. White's death and demand a thorough investigation to ensure that such tragedies never happen again," the paper wrote.  As the case against Anthony McIntosh moves forward, the question remains: how many more Ronnie Whites will be left to die in the hands of those who are supposed to protect them? The hope is that this case will serve as a wake-up call to those in power to take action and make the necessary changes to prevent such incidents from happening again in the future.
