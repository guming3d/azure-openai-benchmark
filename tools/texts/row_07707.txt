article: Arsene Wenger has revealed that his biggest regret in football is missing out on the signing of Cristiano Ronaldo before the Portuguese star sealed a deal with Manchester United. The then 18-year-old signed for Sir Alex Ferguson's side from Sporting Lisbon in 2003, but Wenger believes he was 'so close' to getting there before United. Speaking to Arsenal's official smartphone sponsor, Huawei, Wenger said: 'My biggest regret, I was so close, to signing Cristiano Ronaldo, and not only did I not get him he signed for Manchester United, so that of course still hurts today.'

The Arsenal boss also claimed that his greatest every signing was Cameroon defender Lauren, rather than Gunners legend Thierry Henry. He added: 'I’d never say which player was the best, but I think it’s the signings like Lauren who you spot when nobody else does.

chatgpt: Arsene Wenger, the former Arsenal manager, has spoken about his regret over not signing Cristiano Ronaldo during his time at the North London club. The Portuguese forward signed for Manchester United in 2003 for a fee of £12.24 million and went on to become one of the best players in the world. Wenger, who managed Arsenal for 22 years between 1996 and 2018, revealed that he was "so close" to signing Ronaldo before he joined United. In an interview with French TV channel Canal+, he said, "We had an agreement with Sporting and [Ronaldo's agent] Jorge Mendes. But for one or two details, it didn't happen. Because of that, the club missed Ronaldo, which was a huge disappointment." Wenger admitted that missing out on Ronaldo was a major regret of his time at Arsenal, saying, "Not signing Ronaldo when he was at Sporting Lisbon was my biggest regret. We were so close to signing him. Maybe it was my fault. But we had other players like [Jose Antonio] Reyes and [Gael] Clichy that was very close." Despite this, Wenger did acknowledge one of his best ever signings during his tenure at Arsenal. He praised former Gunners defender Lauren, who joined the club from Mallorca in 2000 for £7.2 million, saying, "One of my big regrets in the time I spent at Arsenal was not winning the Champions League. But one of my best signings was Lauren, who scored in the final at the Stade de France." Wenger was also bullish about Arsenal's chances of success this season, claiming that the team were in a "comfortable position" to challenge for the title. He said, "Arsenal have a good team, a good coach, and they are in a comfortable position. The gap is not insurmountable. They have the potential to challenge for the Premier League title." Current Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has made some astute signings in recent months, with Thomas Partey and Gabriel Magalhaes arriving in the summer transfer window. The Gunners currently sit in 11th place in the Premier League table, but they have games in hand over the teams around them. Wenger's comments about Ronaldo will no doubt stir up some emotions among Arsenal fans, who will wonder what might have been had the Portuguese superstar joined the club. Nevertheless, the Frenchman will always be remembered as one of the greatest managers in Arsenal's history, and it is clear that he still has a lot of respect for the club and its fans.
