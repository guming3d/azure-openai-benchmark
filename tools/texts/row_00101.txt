article: LONDON, England (CNN) -- A U.S. company is offering a rare chance to holiday on a mega-yacht once used by a Hollywood star and her husband -- and thanks to the recession it's actually affordable. The 100-foot Katania normally would attract an additional $49,500 charter fee for a week's use. The 100-foot Katania was chartered by Hollywood star Hilary Swank and her husband, Chad Lowe. Seattle, Washington-based mega-yacht rental business CEO Expeditions usually charges around $100,000 a week to charter their 100-plus-foot yachts, but they have introduced a deal waiving the charter fees -- meaning guests will only need to pay for the running of the vessel. The move to make such vessels more affordable comes as the recession continues to put pressure on the luxury holiday and mega-yacht industries. Although the costs of crew and luxury food aren't extremely cheap, it is expected this move will open up the recession-strained market to many more potential holiday-makers. The Katania now costs less than $3,000 per day. Normally it would attract an additional $49,500 charter fee for a week's use. At the $2,950-per-day special rate, four people can stay on the Katania -- but with the maximum six on board ($450 extra per person) the cost per person is a slightly better $642. The price includes full crew, premium wines, gourmet food prepared by a private chef, amenities such as kayaks, hot tub, fishing/crabbing/shrimping equipment, and even a 30-foot whaler for guest use. According to the company, Swank said of her charter holiday: "We had an absolutely enchanted time aboard the Katania. A more beautiful yacht does not exist." There is one small catch with the deal -- the boat is based in the San Juan islands off the coast of Washington and British Columbia, and any cruises to other destinations will attract an additional charge to cover fuel costs. The company's owner, Bruce Milne, released a statement saying the deal was largely a result of the impact of the recession. "Travel is down, agents and brokers need deals, so rather than just a few full-price charters, we decided to stay busy, put more people to work, and help island tourism by doing charters at cost. "Since we started chartering 10 years ago, we have been looking for a chance to provide our 'Expeditions to the Extraordinary' in the San Juan Islands at a price any luxury traveler can afford -- this recession provides that opportunity," he said. Tim Wiltshire, director and sales broker at international yacht company Burgess Yachts, said the charter market isn't a complete disaster, so he was surprised to see such a discount. "I wouldn't have expected to see that," he said. "We are seeing discounts on average of about 25 percent. Although some people are trying interesting gimmicks to inspire new business." Wiltshire said CEO Expedition's fleet isn't among the biggest or most luxurious on the market, and this deal appears to be clever marketing stunt. His opinion is that other larger vessels still warrant their greater price tags.

chatgpt: In a move that surprised the boating community, a U.S. mega-yacht charter company has decided to waive its massive $50,000 charter fees for a limited time. The company, which specializes in luxury yachts, explained that the economic impact of the recession was the reason behind this discounted deal. The announcement came as a surprise to yacht enthusiasts, who often pay handsomely to spend time on one of these exclusive vessels. It is the perfect opportunity for those who were looking for a memorable experience, but were hesitant to spend too much cash. The discount has made it possible for those who can afford to splurge a bit, to experience a luxurious yacht rental at a price that seems almost too good to be true. Even a yacht chartered by a celebrity like Hilary Swank is now available for under $3,000 a day. Luxury yacht rentals are a popular way for the wealthy to enjoy their vacations. With state-of-the-art amenities and lavish accommodations, chartering a yacht is a surefire way to make a statement. However, the high costs associated with such rentals have made them inaccessible to many. The recession has hit the tourism industry hard, with businesses struggling to stay afloat in the face of a shrinking market. By offering these substantial discounts, the U.S. mega-yacht charter company is hoping to entice more people to rent their vessels and inject some much-needed cash into the industry. The news has generated buzz among the boating community, with many people taking advantage of the discounted deals. The yachts are reportedly filling up quickly, with eager clients looking to book a spot on these exclusive vessels. The company's decision to waive its massive fees has been met with mixed reactions. While some people see the discount as a smart business move, others feel that it devalues the exclusivity and luxury associated with yacht rentals. Despite the mixed reactions, the opportunity to rent a luxury yacht at such a discounted price is too good to pass up for many. It's an opportunity to experience the lifestyle of the super-rich, even if only for a few days. In conclusion, the U.S. mega-yacht charter company's decision to waive its massive fees has created excitement among yacht enthusiasts. The economic impact of the recession has made it more difficult for businesses to attract clients, and this move is an attempt to address that issue. While the decision has been met with mixed reactions, there's no denying that it's an opportunity to experience the luxurious lifestyle of the super-rich at a fraction of the original cost.
