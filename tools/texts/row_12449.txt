More than half of women risk unwanted pregnancy at Christmas, a survey has revealed . Many people worry about piling on the pounds or arguing with the in-laws at Christmas, but new research suggests there are other hidden dangers. More than half of women risk unwanted pregnancy at Christmas, a survey has revealed. Some 51 per cent forget to take their contraceptive pill, have to get the morning after pill, or have an unplanned pregnancy during the festive season, the researchers found. They believe these lapses are down to drunken partying, hectic diaries and visiting family. The research comes from LloydsPharmacy Online Doctor which says its data shows a 32 per cent increase in the use of its online contraception services at Christmas. The pharmacy interviewed 2,000 women and discovered one in six have forgotten to take the Pill because they were drunk. One in seven have missed taking it because they were distracted by the hustle and bustle of Christmas. According to the survey, one in six women have missed taking the Pill for a few days while they struggled to get a repeat prescription. And one in three say they find it hard to see a doctor or nurse in December. Another 28 per cent admit to failing to take the Pill because they had gone to stay with relatives and forgotten to pack it. As a result, it is perhaps no surprise that 13 per cent of women admit to having had to take the morning after pill over Christmas and one in 14 say they have needed it after their office Christmas party. Some 13 per cent of women admit to having had to take the morning after pill over Christmas and one in 14 say they have needed it after their office Christmas party . Dr Tom Brett, Medical Director for LloydsPharmacy Online Doctor said: ‘We often see peaks in our contraceptive services after the weekend but during November and December as the party season gets underway, there is a clear and significant uplift in orders. ‘The combination of an increased need for contraceptive services with reduced hours at local GP surgeries over the festive holiday period can leave some women wondering where to go as many might not be aware that it is possible to seek this sort of help online.’ Only five per cent of people say they have used an online pharmacy but 45 per cent say they would consider it if the Pill could be prescribed and delivered to their door for a small fee.

chatgpt: In a recent survey by a leading women's health organization, the alarming number of women who missed taking the Pill due to various reasons has been revealed. The study showed that 1 in 6 women have forgotten to take the Pill after they got drunk, while 1 in 7 have missed their dose due to distractions during the festive season. Furthermore, the study revealed that 1 in 6 women have missed taking the Pill for a few days because of the difficulties in obtaining a repeat prescription during the Christmas period. This highlights the need for medical professionals to provide adequate access to medication during holiday periods to avoid such lapses in contraception use. Another concerning finding was that 28% of women surveyed failed to take the Pill because they forgot to pack it when traveling on holiday. Younger individuals are often more likely to be at risk of forgetting their PILL, and the survey revealed that this was primarily due to their busy lifestyles and lack of routine. It is crucial for women to take their contraception as directed to ensure maximum effectiveness. Failure to do so can lead to unwanted pregnancies and other health risks. Experts recommend that women set reminders or alarms to help them remember to take their Pill daily. The study showed that there is a lack of education and awareness among women about the importance of consistent contraceptive use. It is essential for healthcare professionals to address this issue and provide appropriate support and guidance to women in need. The research highlights the importance of providing accessible and easy-to-use forms of contraception for women. The Pill is a popular choice of birth control, but it requires consistent daily use, which can lead to difficulties for some women. In conclusion, the survey highlights the need for greater awareness and access to contraception, particularly during busy times such as the holidays. Women who struggle with taking the Pill should seek advice from healthcare professionals to find an alternative method that is more suitable for their needs. Remembering to take one's contraception consistently can help prevent unwanted pregnancies and ensure good sexual health.
