article: (CNN) -- Mexico's foreign ministry has accused a U.S. border patrol agent of fatally shooting a Mexican citizen over the weekend. The shooting occurred near the bridge that connects Brownsville, Texas, with the Mexican town of Matamoros, the foreign ministry said Sunday in a statement condemning the violence. The ministry said a Mexican national died after being shot by the U.S. agent, but did not release details about the circumstances surrounding the Saturday violence. "The Mexican government has repeatedly expressed that the disproportionate use of lethal force in the exercising of immigration control functions is unacceptable under any circumstance," the foreign ministry said, calling for a thorough investigation. A U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman said two agents fired shots Saturday morning during "dangerous encounters" along the border. The truth about the Fast and Furious scandal . But U.S. officials have not confirmed any deaths related to the shootings. "We have been unable to establish a connection between the shootings and a victim reportedly admitted to a Matamoros hospital," U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman Bill Brooks said. Agents "were involved in two dangerous encounters" in the Rio Grande Valley Saturday morning, he said. In one incident, an agent fired toward someone who was throwing rocks at him, he said. "At approximately the same time, another nearby agent observed a person aiming a weapon at him and fired his service weapon in defense," he said. The FBI is investigating, Brooks said. In 2010, the FBI investigated after a border patrol agent shot and killed a Mexican teen along the border between El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. Federal officials closed the case in April, saying there was not enough evidence to pursue charges against the officer and that he acted within the agency's policies for use of force. The officer received widespread condemnation from critics who questioned his use of deadly force against 15-year-old Sergio Adrian Hernandez Guereca, who authorities said had been throwing rocks at the agent when he was shot and killed.

Hernandez had a history of involvement with human smuggling and was on a list of repeat juvenile offenders, U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman Mark Qualia told CNN after the shooting. An appeal is pending in a lawsuit filed by the teen's parents in U.S. federal court, accusing the officer of using excessive force. The Mexican government filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case last week, noting that its request to extradite the border patrol agent for prosecution had been denied. "As a matter of international responsibility, the fact that the victim was on Mexican soil when he was killed does not absolve the United States of responsibility for the acts of its agent," the brief said.

chatgpt: Mexican officials have come out condemning what they say is a "disproportionate use of lethal force" in near the U.S-Mexico border. The alleged incident comes after two border patrol agents opened fire, leading to a fatal shooting. The incident has left many questions unanswered with the possibility of two sides to the story. The FBI has stepped in to take over the investigation and is expected to release a statement soon. According to sources, the shooting took place on Monday night in the Mexican town of Nogales, close to the border with Arizona. It is believed that the agents opened fire during what they described as "dangerous encounters" with individuals, leading to at least one person being fatally injured. Mexico's foreign ministry has called on U.S. authorities to conduct a "thorough and transparent investigation" into the incident. In a statement, the ministry expressed "deep concern and condemnation of the disproportionate use of lethal force" in the shooting. The border patrol, on the other hand, offered a different version of events, saying that the agents had opened fire in self-defense after coming under attack by individuals throwing rocks. The agents were responding to reports of illegal activity in the area when they encountered the group and were forced to protect themselves, according to a border patrol spokesman. The incident comes at a time when tensions between the United States and Mexico are already strained, particularly over the issue of immigration. The Mexican government has been strongly critical of the policies of U.S. President Donald Trump towards immigrants and has previously accused U.S. border patrol agents of using excessive force in the past. This event highlights the tensions that exist between the two nations over border control and emphasizes the need for continued dialogue in solving cross-border disputes. The FBI is currently investigating the incident and is expected to release a statement soon. It remains to be seen what conclusions the agency will come to and how the incident will be resolved, but it is clear that the event has further increased tensions between the two nations. As Mexico continues to call on U.S. authorities to investigate and pursue accountability, it is clear that the issue of cross-border violence and patrol techniques remains a complicated and sensitive issue that will require continued attention and focus from both sides.
