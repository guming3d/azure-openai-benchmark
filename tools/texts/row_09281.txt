Clubbers using the toilets had a nasty shock when they fell through to the cellar when the floor gave way from under them at a Salford nightclub. Mark Cowgill, 29, and six others were using the gents when the floor collapsed and sent them crashing into the drinks cellar of Hell Polish Club in Eccles. None of the seven men were injured when they fell, and ambulance crews, including those specially trained in hazardous area response, were speedily dispatched to the Church Road club shortly after 1.30am on March 15. Clubbers fell through the floor after the toilet collapsed in a Salford nightclub, which miraculously didn't leave anyone injured . Greater Manchester Police attended the incident and a building control officer was called to secure the scene and investigate. The council said that evidence of a water leak was found at the area of the collapse, which may have been the cause. A spokeswoman for the North West Ambulance Service said four of the men were taken to Salford Royal with minor injuries. It was described by one survivor as 'like something out of a film' as the floor creaked and gave way below him . The cause of the collapse is unclear, although examiners from the council believe it might be due to water leakages . A survey was recommended to assess the full extent of the damage, and the club remained open after the incident but it is not known whether or not it has been open since. However, the council apparently has no power to force it to shut. Cowgill said: 'I was just washing my hands when we heard a creak. 'Everyone sort of stopped and looked at each other and it just gave way. All seven men using the toilet at the time collapse through the floor to the drinks cellar, although only four were sent to hospital and none were seriously injured . 'It was quite surreal, it was like something out of a film to be honest. 'I ended up in a heap in the cellar. 'We were all in shock just looking at each other. It was frightening.'

chatgpt: A night out in Salford turned dramatic for a group of men who were using the toilet at a nightclub. A sudden creak from the floor was all it took for the toilet floor to collapse, causing all seven men to plummet into the drinks cellar below. According to reports, the incident took place at around 1:30 am on Saturday at a popular nightclub in Salford. The men were using the cubicles when they heard a creak followed by a loud crash as the floor collapsed under them. They fell around six feet into the cellar containing alcohol and other drinks. When emergency services arrived at the scene, they found four of the men had sustained injuries and needed hospital treatment. However, none of them were seriously injured and are expected to make a full recovery. The local council believes that the cause of the collapse may have been a water leak. They have ordered an investigation to determine the exact cause of the incident, including whether the nightclub had taken appropriate precautions to ensure the safety of its customers. The nightclub, which has not been named, has released a statement expressing its concern for the men who were injured and promising to cooperate fully with the investigation. They have also temporarily closed the nightclub to assess and repair any damage caused. While it is not uncommon for floor collapses to occur in older buildings, such incidents still have the potential to cause serious injuries or even fatalities. The importance of regular inspections and maintenance of public buildings cannot be emphasized enough to prevent such occurrences in the future. The incident has understandably caused concern among locals and frequent nightclub-goers in the area. However, as the injured men were not seriously hurt, many have taken to social media to make light of the situation, with some even praising the nightclub for having a "new feature." In a time where many are struggling with the impact of the ongoing pandemic, incidents like this serve as a reminder to be extra vigilant when out and about. As investigations into the incident continue, it is hoped that measures will be put in place to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
