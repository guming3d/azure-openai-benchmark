'Of course as a professional and a winner you always want to play every game, so we will see what the decision is of the coach. 'But of course I am a professional player and I want to play every game that is possible.'

chatgpt: Goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois is set to sign a new contract with Chelsea, following his return from a successful loan spell at Atletico Madrid. The Belgium international has enjoyed a remarkable three years with the La Liga giants, helping them to win the Spanish league title once and reach the Champions League final on two occasions.  Courtois has been one of the most impressive goalkeepers in Europe during his time in Spain and was a vital part of Atletico's success. He returned to Chelsea this summer, eager to fight for his place in the first team. However, it seems that his impressive performances have convinced manager Jose Mourinho of his credentials, as he has been selected ahead of long-time Blues goalkeeper Petr Cech as the first choice shot-stopper for the current season. Courtois has repaid that faith with some fine displays, keeping several clean sheets in the Premier League and helping the team to climb to the top of the table. His outstanding displays have not gone unnoticed by the club hierarchy, who have reportedly opened talks with the 23-year-old over a new contract. The new deal is expected to keep the talented keeper at the club for the foreseeable future. Despite his young age, Courtois has already amassed extensive experience at the highest level, playing for Chelsea while Cech was out injured and during his spell with Atletico. His incredible reflexes and commanding presence in the box have made him one of the best goalkeepers in the world. And as he continues to develop his skills and gain more experience, he is only going to get even better. If he signs a new contract, Courtois is likely to become a vital part of Chelsea's future plans. His potential is massive, and with the likes of Eden Hazard and Oscar around him, he has the perfect platform to develop further. With Chelsea in good form and chasing multiple trophies this season, keeping hold of a player like Courtois is vital for their success. Overall, Courtois' new contract is excellent news for the Blues and their fans. The Belgian shot-stopper has quickly become one of the best goalkeepers in Europe and is a crucial part of Chelsea's future. The club should do all they can to tie him down to a long-term deal, as he has the potential to help them achieve great success in the years to come.
