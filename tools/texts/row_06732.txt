A  judge refused to sentence a thief who stole heating oil from a village hall amid fears he would 'overreact' when sentencing him. Robert Lee, 24, admitted siphoning off the oil from a small village hall and was expecting to be punished when he was brought before district judge Nigel Cadbury. But Mr Cadbury told the hearing at . Worcester Magistrates Court on Tuesday that his wife worked on a village . hall committee and he sympathised with their cause which left him unable to issue a fair sentence. Robert Lee admitted stealing heating oil from Peopleton Village Hall, Worcs on March 18 . He said: 'My wife is on a small village hall committee. I feel very strongly about this sort of behaviour. 'Village halls struggle to survive and raise enough money to keep going. 'This sort of theft can put an end to a village hall's existence. 'If this happened in my village hall it would not surprise me if the village hall had to be closed down. 'I feel I would overreact and consider that he should undoubtedly go to prison for this. 'It would be wrong for me to sentence him. I may be seen to be biased." The court heard Lee, from Gloucester, was caught stealing heating oil from Peopleton Village Hall, Worcs. Prosecutor Kerry Lovegrove told the court police were called to the scene at 2am on March 18. When they arrived they found a van with it's back doors open and fuel pumps and containers nearby. District Judge Nigel Cadbury told Worcester Magistrates Court (pictured) that he couldn't pass on fair sentence on thief on Robert Lee . Miss Lovegrove said: 'He stated that he had taken it, he would pay for it and put it back. 'The police have assisted in putting the fuel back in the tank to make sure that the village hall had fuel the next day.' Lee was eventually handed a 12-month community order and ordered to undertake 150 hours of unpaid work after being transferred to another courtroom. Chairman of the bench Chris Bull told Lee: "You were caught red-handed. This was a planned act that targeted a village that is not on the way to anywhere. 'You will be aware that this is a prevalent offence in this county and in rural areas.' Lee was ordered to pay £83 costs and a victim surcharge of £60. He was also ordered to pay the village hall £525.65 for the fuel, which may have been contaminated, and £48.58 for damage he caused.

chatgpt: In a sentencing hearing at the local courthouse, Robert Lee was handed a 12-month community order after being found guilty of a series of charges. The verdict from the judge came as no surprise to those in attendance, as the prosecution had presented a compelling case against him. Lee had been accused of multiple offenses, including theft, vandalism and assault. According to the prosecution, he had been involved in several incidents over the course of several months, in which he had targeted various businesses and individuals. The prosecution presented a range of evidence against Lee, including CCTV footage from the scenes of the crimes, eyewitness testimony and physical evidence found at the locations. The judge noted that this evidence was substantial and convincing and that Lee had not provided any meaningful defense for his actions. The community order handed down to Lee will require him to complete a range of activities aimed at rehabilitating him and preventing future offenses. These activities will include regular meetings with a probation officer, participation in counseling sessions and adherence to a strict curfew. The sentencing judge emphasized that the community order was a serious punishment and that Lee should take it seriously. He warned that any violation of the order could result in further legal action against Lee. The verdict was met with mixed reactions from those in attendance. Some expressed relief at seeing justice done and the perpetrator punished, while others expressed sympathy for Lee and concern for his future. Speaking after the hearing, a spokesperson for the prosecution expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the case. "We are pleased that justice has been served in this case. We hope that Mr. Lee takes the community order seriously and uses it as an opportunity to turn his life around." Lee did not speak to reporters after the hearing, but his legal team issued a statement expressing disappointment with the verdict. They suggested that they may seek to appeal the decision, though no specific plans for this have been announced. The community order handed down to Lee is the latest in a series of measures aimed at reducing crime and improving community safety. It is hoped that the order will not only address Lee's behavior but also act as a deterrent to others who may be considering similar offenses. Overall, the community order handed down to Robert Lee is a significant punishment that reflects the seriousness of the offenses he was found guilty of. It is now up to Lee to show that he can accept responsibility for his actions and work toward becoming a productive member of society.
