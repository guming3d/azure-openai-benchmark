article: A neglectful family life and the sounds of daily domestic abuse soon led Ben Smith into a downward spiral of self-harm. The New Zealand man was mistreated by his step-father for as long as he could remember, while his mother remained powerless against the man who beat her behind closed doors. 'There were times when it was late at night and I'd be woken up because of screaming, I could hear him beating my mum in the lounge,' Ben told the New Zealand Herald. Ben Smith, from New Zealand, was bullied by his step-father and neglected by his mother, eventually leading him to self-harm . 'I just felt cowardice, there was nothing I could do about it.' Only a teenager at the time, Ben sought to find affection in other places and became dependant on relationships. It was when he was between relationships, halfway through year 10, that he turned to self-harm after seeing examples in blog posts. Clearly deep in depression, Ben secluded himself to his room and began to cut himself regularly with blades where he hoped no one would notice the scars. 'It was in a period between relationships. I wasn't getting any affection there, I wasn't getting any affection at home, and I felt like I had no feelings, so with self-harm I felt pain,' Ben told the New Zealand Herald. His life was turned around however after a confrontation with his mother. 'I was just sick of the way I was treated. I said like, 'Mum you have to either get rid of him or me.' And she said, 'He gets home in about two hours, you'd better be gone by then,' he said. Since that day, Ben has barely looked back. He moved in with his maternal grandmother after tracking her down and has since started an audio engineering course. Although he's had to temporarily leave the course behind and move on to full time work due to his grandfather being diagnosed with cancer, Ben leads a far happier life.
