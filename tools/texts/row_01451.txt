Wasserman Schultz, who battled breast cancer, agreed during the joint interview at an early rainy morning practice. "I don't' think we have the desire to talk politics on the field. We're just friends out here," she said. Most of the time, anyway. Capito admitted that sometimes partisan discussions do ensue, but teammates from the opposite side of the aisle shut it down, fast.

chatgpt: Washington D.C. - The annual bipartisan women's softball game took on a different tone this year as the politics of the upcoming elections infiltrated the normally friendly competition. The game featured two co-captains with strong political ties, Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Republican Rep. Shelley Moore Capito. Wasserman Schultz, who also serves as head of the Democratic National Committee, led her team onto the field with a sense of determination. The Congresswoman has been a vocal supporter of women's sports and was excited to participate in the game once again. However, this year was different as the team's strength was tested by Capito's determined Republican squad. Capito, who is running for a Senate seat, was equally determined to win the game. She led her team with a fierce determination and the desire to prove herself as a leader. Capito's political stance was evident on the field as she commanded her team to victory. Her team came out on top with a score of six to five in a close game that came down to the wire. The game not only showcased the athletic abilities of the women, but also their political influence. Many of the players in attendance had ties to politics, including members of Congress, lobbyists, and political consultants. The game was a platform for these women to show off their athletic abilities, but also to network and make key connections that could advance their political careers. Wasserman Schultz spoke to reporters after the game and expressed her excitement about being a part of the bipartisan event. "This game is always a highlight of the year for me," she said. "It's so great to see women from both sides of the aisle come together to play a sport that we all love." Capito also spoke to reporters and noted the importance of setting aside political differences on the field. "At the end of the day, we may have different political beliefs, but we are all here to play a game and have a good time," she said. "It's important to remember that we are all on the same team when it comes to supporting women's sports." The annual game has been a tradition in Washington D.C. for over a decade and serves as a reminder that politicians are not just numbers on a ballot, but human beings with passions and interests outside of their professional lives. It's also a testament to the power of sports to bring people together, regardless of their political differences. As the event came to a close, the players hugged and congratulated each other on a hard-fought game. They left the field as colleagues and friends, knowing that they'll be working together to advance women's sports and to make a difference in the world of politics. The next annual game is already being planned, and it's expected to bring even more excitement and camaraderie to the world of electoral politics.
