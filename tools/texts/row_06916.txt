A supermarket is offering shoppers 'free erections' after a sign was wrongly translated into Welsh. The sign on a cash machine at the Tesco store in Aberystwyth should read 'arian am ddim' which means free money. But the supermarket blundered by saying 'codiad am ddim' which means free erections. The error was seen by Welsh speaking Aberystwyth councillor Ceredig Davies who said: 'There were a few titters in the town so I went down to have a look myself. 'Ten out of ten to Tesco for considering the Welsh language. 'But perhaps they should have had it checked by an actual Welsh speaker before putting the signs on the machines. 'People get their Welsh translations wrong from time to time but this one is hilarious.' Managers at the Tesco Express store in the university town took the sign down and were investigating the mistake. But shoppers believe the supermarket used Google to translate - and got it badly wrong. Garin Fitter, 18, whose girlfriend works at the new store, said: 'I am not sure how they came up with because anyone with a basic understanding of Welsh would know it is the wrong word. 'They must have used Google translate. 'I think it's quite funny but I know some people might be offended they didn't bother to check they had got it right.' The Tesco social media team saw the funny side of the incident, tweeting: 'Weâ€™ve taken down the sign and will replace it with the correct translation. We appreciate this is a sensitive area.' In 2010 Swansea Council sent an email to its in-house translations service to have a road sign - 'No entry for heavy goods vehicles. Residential site only' - translated into Welsh. The only problem was that the Welsh translator wasn't in at the time. An automated email response was sent to council officials who believed it was exactly what they needed. But in fact it stated: 'I am not in the office at the moment. Send any work to be translated.' Unaware of the real meaning of the message, authorities had it printed on the road sign under the English. A council spokesman said the sign was removed as soon as it was notified of the blunder. Managers at the Tesco Express store in Abeystwyth took the sign down and were investigating the mistake .

chatgpt: An embarrassing mistake made in the small town of Aberystwyth has caused a stir in Wales. The town's council had erected a sign which was meant to read 'arian am ddim', which translates to "free money" in English. Unfortunately, a simple yet critical error led to the sign reading 'codiad am ddim' instead, which means "free erections." The blunder was quickly noticed by a Welsh-speaking councillor who was passing by the sign. They immediately notified the council and the sign was swiftly removed. However, the mistake has caused amusement and some embarrassment amongst the local community. The council has apologized for the error, citing a miscommunication with their sign-making company. They have assured locals that the necessary steps have been taken to prevent such a mistake from happening again in the future. In the meantime, the incident has sparked many humorous reactions on social media, with some comparing the sign to Monty Python's famous "Biggus Dickus" sketch. Others have expressed their disappointment that the sign did not, in fact, offer free money - regardless of the awkward message it conveyed. Despite the council's swift response, some have criticized the mistake as a symptom of a larger issue with the lack of emphasis put on Welsh language proficiency among public officials. The incident has reignited discussions about the importance of preserving Wales' native language and the need for bilingualism in the country's representation. The incident has also brought attention to the growing debate around language and identity in Wales. As the country seeks to assert its autonomy and unique cultural heritage, there is a growing demand for greater recognition and use of the Welsh language in public spaces and official documents. It remains to be seen how the council will proceed in the aftermath of the incident. However, it is clear that the sign's unintended message has caused quite a stir, both in Aberystwyth and beyond. As for the actual meaning of the sign, whether it offered "free money" or "free erections," we may never know.
