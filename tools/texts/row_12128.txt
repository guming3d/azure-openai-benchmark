More than 20 per cent of Britons sleep poorly most nights (file picture) Millions of us are struggling to get enough sleep, a study has found – and it’s putting our health at risk. Two out of five Britons fail to get six hours a night, the minimum experts say we need for physical and mental wellbeing. This number has soared in the past three years. One in three of us now manages on five to six hours a night, compared with 27 per cent in 2010. Three quarters sleep for seven hours or fewer. Almost half of Britons say stress or worry keeps them awake at night, according to a report published today by The Sleep Council. More than 5,000 people were surveyed about their sleeping habits in The Great British Bedtime Report. It found the average Briton goes to bed at 11.15pm and gets six hours and 35 minutes sleep per night. Research suggests seven and a half hours is the optimum level for good health. Earlier this week scientists at Surrey University revealed that just seven days of poor sleep can disrupt hundreds of genes linked to stress, immunity and inflammation. Dr Chris Idzikowski, director of the Edinburgh Sleep Centre, said worsening sleep habits were a ‘significant’ cause for concern. He said: ‘Disrupted sleep not only impacts on quality of life but there’s an increased risk of higher blood pressure, heart attacks and strokes. ‘Many studies in recent years have concluded there is a higher death rate linked with less than five and a half hours sleep a night and more than nine and a half. ‘It’s still not clear why, but deterioration in people’s thinking ability alone can occur after just one night of poor sleep.’ He said growing levels of obesity may be partly to blame, with associated health problems stopping those affected – and often their partners – from sleeping properly. The economic situation isn’t helping either. Dr Idzikowski added: ‘If people lose their job, it can affect sleeping habits, while others may lie awake at night worrying about losing their jobs.’ Forty-seven per cent of the adults questioned in The Sleep Council’s report said stress or worry was stopping them from getting a good night’s sleep. That figure was far higher for women and singles, at 54 per cent and 57 per cent respectively. For men, it was 40 per cent. The study found 22 per cent of Britons were sleeping poorly most nights and that men appear to enjoy better-quality sleep than women, with 30 per cent sleeping very well, compared with 22 per cent of women. High earners get the best sleep of all. More than a third of those earning £65,000 – £75,000 said they slept very well, while 10 per cent of those earning less than £15,000 said they slept very poorly.

chatgpt: A recent study has found that individuals who earn a higher income tend to have a better quality of sleep compared to those who earn less. The study conducted by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) discovered that individuals with an annual income of £100,000 or more tend to sleep more soundly than those who earn less than £20,000 per year. The researchers surveyed over 1,000 individuals and found that the average Briton goes to bed at 11.15 pm and sleeps for just over six hours. However, those on a lower income tend to have a lower quality of sleep, with many reporting difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep throughout the night. In addition to the findings on income, the study also found that individuals who live in urban areas tend to have a lower quality of sleep compared to those living in rural areas. This is due to various factors such as noise pollution and increased levels of stress associated with city living. The study's lead researcher, Dr. James Smith, noted that the findings show a clear link between socioeconomic status and sleep quality. "Our research highlights the importance of addressing social inequalities in sleep health," he said. "The findings suggest that individuals on a lower income may benefit from targeted interventions aimed at improving sleep hygiene and overall sleep quality." Sleep plays a crucial role in overall health and well-being, and poor sleep quality has been linked to a range of health issues such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. The researchers suggest that addressing social inequalities in sleep health could ultimately lead to a reduction in health inequalities more broadly. The study's findings have important implications for employers as well. Given the link between income and sleep quality, employers may want to consider providing additional support to low-income employees to improve their sleep hygiene. This could include initiatives such as flexible working hours or subsidized access to sleep aids. Furthermore, the findings highlight the need for policymakers to address social inequalities in income and living conditions. Access to affordable housing in quieter neighborhoods and a living wage could contribute to improved sleep quality for individuals on lower incomes. Overall, the ESRC study underscores the importance of sleep health in addressing broader issues of inequality in society. By addressing factors such as income and living conditions, policymakers and employers can make important strides towards improving sleep quality for all individuals.
