chatgpt: Oklahoma City â€“ A former Oklahoma City police officer, Daniel Ken Holtzclaw, was arrested on Thursday on complaints of rape, forcible oral sodomy, sexual battery, and indecent exposure. The 27-year-old officer has been accused of assaulting several African American women between the ages of 34 and 58. The Oklahoma City Police Department's Sex Crimes Unit started investigating Holtzclaw after a woman reported he had sexually assaulted her during a routine traffic stop. The police then found  several other victims who had similar stories. All of the women who have come forward are African American, which has raised concerns about whether Holtzclaw targeted them because of their race. The police have not yet released the victims' identities. Holtzclaw has been charged with 16 counts, including first-degree rape. A conviction for first-degree rape carries a sentence of five years to life or life without parole. The former officer faces ten counts of sexual battery, three counts of forcible oral sodomy, and single counts of indecent exposure. After the arrest, the Oklahoma City Police Department released a statement, saying, "These are very serious charges, and the Oklahoma City Police Department is fully committed to ensuring justice is served in this case." The department also said that Holtzclaw had been terminated from his position in 2015. Holtzclaw is now in custody, and the police are urging anyone who believes they may have been a victim of sexual assault to come forward. The investigation is expected to continue over the coming weeks as the authorities try to determine if there are any other potential victims. The arrest of a former police officer on rape charges has sent shockwaves through Oklahoma City. It is a reminder that no one is above the law, and the police have a duty to serve and protect all citizens. The Oklahoma City Police Department has said that it takes its responsibility seriously, and it will do everything in its power to ensure that justice is served in this case.
