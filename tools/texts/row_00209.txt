It is the latest diet fad, urging  weight watchers to soak in ice-cold baths, give up fruit and gulp down black coffee before exercise. The self-published ebook, Six Weeks To OMG: Get Skinnier Than All Your Friends, has knocked the Dukan Diet from the top of the bestseller list and secured its author a seven-figure book deal in the US. But critics say the word-of-mouth hit, said to be inspired by reality TV show The Only Way Is Essex, cynically targets impressionable teenagers. Impressionable: Nutritionists and parents say the 'quick fix' diet could herald an epidemic of eating disorders (file photo) Nutritionists and parents say the ‘quick fix’ diet could herald an epidemic of eating disorders. Psychologist Deanne Jade, of the National Centre for Eating Disorders, said she was horrified by the diet’s premise. She added: ‘Teenagers will try anything. They’ll sit in a cold bath for hours. ‘This diet uses psychology against vulnerable young people and will encourage unhealthy competition to lose weight.’ Mrs Jade warned that sitting in ice-cold baths can seriously damage the immune system and said drinking black coffee stimulates the adrenal system, leaching minerals and vitamins from the body and damaging the thyroid. Criticism: The word-of-mouth hit targets impressionable teenagers, it is claimed . ‘You can lose weight in a million wacky ways. But you’ll put all it all back on again and you may have damaged your body, brain and appetite control for ever,’ she added. Dr Ian Campbell, a GP and weight loss expert, said: ‘My first thought is OMG! This book is encouraging extreme behaviour. ‘Teens are very vulnerable to diet fads, especially quirky ones like this. 'The advice is hypothetically correct but in reality will have little effect on weight loss and some of the advice like taking ice cold baths can be very dangerous. 'This is a cynical attempt to sell huge numbers of books and I certainly wouldn’t recommend it.’ The book, written by a British sports scientist and celebrity personal trainer who goes by the pen name of Venice A Fulton – real name Paul Khanna – claims to use a mix of nutrition, biochemistry, genetics and psychology to help readers lose 20lbs of body fat and reduce cellulite. Khanna denies specifically targeting teenagers and says he would never urge anyone under 16 or who was still growing to diet. A spokesman for Khanna said: ‘The reason Paul wrote the book is to cut through all the myths about dieting and change people’s lifestyle for the better. ‘If people get into healthy habits when they are young that’s obviously a good thing, but that’s not the primary aim of the book.’

chatgpt: In a surprising turn of events, a self-published book has overtaken the Dukan Diet as the top-selling book in the market. The book, titled "The Skinny," has become a word-of-mouth hit amongst teenagers and young adults, much to the chagrin of critics who claim that it cynically targets impressionable youth. "The Skinny" is a supposedly self-help guide that purports to offer tips and tricks for weight loss and achieving the perfect body. The book's author, a self-proclaimed fitness guru, encourages readers to take extreme measures to achieve their desired body type, including strict diets, rigorous exercise routines, and even dangerous weight-loss pills. The book's rise to the top of the bestseller list has sparked concern among mental health experts and eating disorder specialists, who worry about the potential harm the book could cause impressionable young readers. They argue that "The Skinny" promotes unrealistic and dangerous beauty standards and encourages unhealthy tactics for achieving them. Critics have also pointed out the book's questionable credentials, noting that the author has no formal training or educational background in fitness or nutrition. They believe that "The Skinny" only appeals to readers because it promises a quick fix solution to their body image insecurities. Despite the criticisms, "The Skinny" continues to gain popularity, with many young readers praising the book for its helpful tips and relatable tone. However, mental health experts caution that the book's messages must be taken with a grain of salt. In response to the controversy surrounding the book, major bookstores and online retailers have begun to review their policies when it comes to stocking self-help and diet books. Some have called for stricter regulations to prevent potentially harmful content from being sold to impressionable consumers. Overall, the rise of "The Skinny" highlights the dangers of promoting unrealistic and dangerous beauty standards. It also underscores the importance of empowering young people to make informed decisions about their health and wellbeing, rather than relying on shady self-help books that promise quick and easy solutions. As consumers, it's crucial that we remain vigilant and critical of the media we consume, in order to protect ourselves and our loved ones from potentially harmful messages.
