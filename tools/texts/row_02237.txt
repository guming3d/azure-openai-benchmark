article: By . Graham Smith . UPDATED: . 07:41 EST, 12 January 2012 . A team of explorers has discovered the wreck of a British submarine that sunk off the Maltese coast during the Second World War. HMS Olympus struck a mine in the early hours of 8 May, 1942 shortly after she left Malta Harbour under the cover of darkness. Nearly 90 men perished in what was one of the worst naval disasters of the war. Only nine of the vessel's 98 crew members survived after swimming seven miles back to shore in cold water. Pristine condition: A sonar image of the wreck of HMS Olympus, which lies seven miles off the coast of Malta. The submarine's exact location had been a mystery for 70 years . The exact spot where the 283ft-long submarine sank in the Mediterranean Sea remained a mystery for 70 years. But now a marine archaeology survey . team has confirmed that they last year discovered the Olympus' resting . place using side-scan sonar to survey the seabed. Timmy Gambin, the archaeological . director of Florida-based Aurora Trust, told the Guardian: 'We had . suspicions it was the Olympus. 'Armed with our research on the . features of the submarine, where the guns were, the placing and types of . the rudder and propeller, we were able to identify her. 'Except for the damage from the mine she was in pristine condition, sitting upright as if she'd been placed on the seabed.' Olympus is in the best condition of any wreck found by the Aurora Trust with almost no underwater growth on it. The team twice visited the wreck last . year. On the second trip in September, they used deep-sea robotic . vehicles to film the wreck. In action: HMS Olympus in Malta Harbour.

chatgpt: After nearly 80 years, the mystery surrounding the sinking of HMS Olympus has finally been solved.  In May 1942, the British submarine struck a mine off the coast of Malta, sending it to the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea and taking the lives of 89 sailors with it. The exact location of the vessel has remained unknown ever since, leaving family members and historians alike wondering what had happened.  That is, until a team of explorers decided to take it upon themselves to locate the wreck. Equipped with the latest sonar technology, they began surveying the seabed in the hopes of finding any trace of the long-lost submarine.  Their efforts paid off when, after several attempts, they finally detected a sonar image that matched the dimensions of HMS Olympus. The explorers were able to confirm their findings with the help of remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) that were sent down to investigate the area.  The ROVs were able to capture stunning footage of the wreck, showing the remains of the submarine lying on the ocean floor more than 1000 meters below the surface. The wreckage appeared to be in a relatively intact state, despite the fact that it had been submerged for nearly eight decades.  The discovery of HMS Olympus is not just significant for the families of those who lost loved ones in the sinking. Historians say that the vessel's location provides important clues about the events surrounding its demise and the overall naval tactics employed during World War II.  During the war, submarines were a key component of naval warfare, often used for reconnaissance and attacking enemy ships. However, they were also extremely vulnerable to mines and other hazards, as evidenced by the sinking of HMS Olympus.  The vessel's exact location also sheds light on the importance of Malta during the war. At the time of the sinking, Malta was a British stronghold that was key to controlling the Mediterranean. The loss of HMS Olympus was a significant blow to the British forces in the region, and its rediscovery serves as a reminder of the sacrifices made during the war.  For the explorers involved in the discovery, the excitement of uncovering a piece of history is palpable. The team, made up of experts from around the world, spent months planning and executing the search operation. Their hard work and perseverance paid off in the end, and they say that the discovery is one that they will never forget.  The team plans to continue exploring the area around the wreck in the hopes of gaining further insight into the events leading up to the sinking of HMS Olympus. They also hope that their discovery will inspire others to uncover the mysteries that lie beneath the surface of the world's oceans.  In the end, the discovery of HMS Olympus serves as a testament to the bravery and sacrifice of the sailors who served aboard her. Though they may be gone, their legacy and the legacy of their vessel will live on for generations to come.
