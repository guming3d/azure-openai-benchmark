article: Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- Nepalis went to the polls Tuesday amid tight security to elect an assembly that will draw up a new constitution. The tiny Himalayan nation has been trying since 2008 to draft a constitution. When it failed to reach any kind of agreement last year, Nepal dissolved its parliament -- paving the way for Tuesday's vote. The 601-seat constituent assembly will double as the parliament. The army has been called in to help police provide security after an alliance of 33 parties vowed to disrupt polling. Despite fears, officials and reports say that voters turned up in large numbers in the 18,438 polling centers across the country to choose assembly members. About 12 million people are eligible to vote. "Except in a few places, elections are being held peacefully," police spokesman Ganesh K. C. said. In the capital Kathmandu, an 8-year-old boy was injured Tuesday morning when an object he found on the street that he thought was a toy exploded, police said. Earlier reports said that three people had been injured. In Dang district, about 350 kilometres (217 miles) southwest of Kathmandu, three people were arrested with explosives-making materials, K.C. said. The anti-poll alliance called a country-wide transport strike in the runup to the elections. But people largely ignored the call and are voting "enthusiastically," said Election Commission spokesman Bir Bahadur Rai. About two dozen people were injured in several incidents over the last week when petrol bombs were thrown at passenger buses. One person later died of injuries in hospital, police said. No party is expected to win a majority although the Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) and the Nepali Congress will vie to be the largest party. For most of its history, Nepal was a monarchy. The Maoists carried out a 10-year insurgency to abolish that system. The fighting claimed about 15,000 lives before the Maoists signed on to a peace accord in 2006. Two years later, in 2008, Nepal held elections for the first time. But since then, lawmakers have not been able to come up with a constitution for the country's 27 million people. Preliminary results will be available Thursday. But final results will take at least a couple of weeks.

chatgpt: After five long years, Nepal's efforts to draft a new constitution are finally coming to fruition. The 601-seat assembly responsible for the monumental task of creating the country's new governing structure will also double as the parliament. However, not everyone is on board with the plan. An alliance of 33 political parties has vowed to disrupt the polling process in an effort to show their dissatisfaction with the new governing framework. This group, consisting of a diverse array of political ideologies and opinions, represents a significant challenge to the drafting process. Despite the opposition, Nepal's leaders are determined to see this process through. The country has been without a constitution since 2006, with numerous attempts made to create one since that time. After years of debate, negotiation, and compromise, the time has finally come for the country to move forward with a new era of governance. This new constitution will establish Nepal as a democratic republic with a president as the head of state. The document will also provide for a federal structure and guarantees for human rights and the protection of minorities. With these protections in place, Nepal is poised to move forward as a stable and prosperous nation. The drafting process has not been without its challenges. Fierce debates have raged over issues such as representation, the role of the judiciary, and the distribution of power. However, despite these challenges, Nepal's leaders have remained committed to finding a solution that works for all parties involved. While the alliance of 33 parties may cause some chaos during the polling process, Nepal's leaders remain optimistic about the future. With the new constitution in place, the country can move forward and address the many challenges it faces, from economic development to environmental sustainability. With determination, hard work, and a commitment to democracy, Nepal is poised to enter a new era of prosperity and progress.
