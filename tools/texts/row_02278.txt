Her father Fayhan al-Ghamdi, a prominent Islamist preacher who regularly appears on television in Saudi Arabia, served only a few months in jail despite admitting having used a cane and cables to inflict the injuries. Activists from the group Women to Drive said the preacher had doubted Lama's virginity and had her checked up by a medic. Randa al-Kaleeb, a social worker from the hospital where Lama was admitted, said the girl's back was broken and that she had been repeatedly raped. Her injuries were then burned. Rather than the death penalty or a long prison sentence, the judge in the case ruled the prosecution could only seek 'blood money', according to activists. The money is compensation for the next of kin under Islamic law. Torture: Saudi preacher Fayhan al-Ghamdi admitting beating his daughter with a cable and is said to have been concerned about his five-year-old daughter's virginity . Activists said the judge ruled the few months al-Ghamdi spent in prison since his arrest in November was sufficient punishment. He has reportedly agreed to pay £31,000 ($50,000), which is believed to have gone to Lama's mother. The amount is half that would have been paid if Lama had been a boy. Activists say under Islamic laws a father cannot be executed for murdering his children. Husbands can also not be executed for murdering their wives, the group say. Three Saudi activists, including Manal al-Sharif, who started the women's right to drive campaign, have raised objections to the ruling. A social media campaign is now gaining momentum after the ruling was publicised. Manal al-Sharif has launched a campaign on Twitter using the hashtag 'Ana Lama', which is translated as I am Lama, calling for better protection for children and women. Local reports say public anger in Saudi Arabia is also growing and authorities have said they will create a 24-hour hotline to take calls about child abuse.

chatgpt: A campaign to give women and children better protection is gaining momentum in Saudi Arabia following the brutal death of Lama al-Ghamdi. The 5-year-old girl's father, Fayhan al-Ghamdi, a prominent Islamist preacher, admitted to beating her so severely that her back was broken, and she was raped and burned. Lama spent ten months in hospital and ultimately died in October from her injuries. Despite the severity of the crime, the father was freed after agreeing to pay £31,000 compensation to Lama's mother. The decision sparked outrage and protests on social media, with many people calling for stricter laws to protect women and children. The case has also brought attention to the issue of domestic violence in the country, as women are often left with no recourse when they suffer abuse at the hands of their male guardians. Under the current system, men have almost unlimited power over female relatives, making them vulnerable to abuse. Women's rights activists in Saudi Arabia are calling for a change in the law to criminalize domestic violence and provide women with more protection. They argue that such protections are necessary to prevent tragedies like the death of Lama al-Ghamdi. One of the activists leading the campaign is Aisha al-Mana, a lawyer and member of the Saudi Shura Council. Al-Mana has been working for years to raise awareness about domestic violence and promote gender equality in the country. She says that the case of Lama al-Ghamdi is a wake-up call for the government to take action to protect women and children. Al-Mana is also calling for more education and awareness campaigns to help change attitudes towards women and domestic violence in the country. She believes that these initiatives can help break down the cultural barriers that prevent women from seeking help and speaking out against abuse. The government has already taken some steps to address the issue. In 2013, it passed a law criminalizing domestic violence and established a specialized court to handle domestic abuse cases. However, critics say the law is not being enforced adequately and there is still a long way to go in terms of protecting women's rights. The case of Lama al-Ghamdi has galvanized activists and drawn attention to the urgent need for better protections for women and children in Saudi Arabia. While there is still much work to be done, the campaign is gaining momentum and may ultimately lead to significant changes in the country's laws and attitudes towards domestic violence.
