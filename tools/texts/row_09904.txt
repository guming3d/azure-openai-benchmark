Leah and Brian had just tied the knot a few weeks ago and were looking forward to starting their new life together. Their honeymoon to Niagara Falls was supposed to be the romantic getaway of a lifetime, but it turned into a nightmare that ended in tragedy. The couple's wedding photographer, Jenna Brown, shared her memories of capturing their special day. "Leah and Brian were such a sweet couple," said Brown. "Their love for each other was evident in every shot we took. I can't believe this has happened to such a wonderful pair of newlyweds."
