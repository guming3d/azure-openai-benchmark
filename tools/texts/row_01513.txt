article: (CNN) -- A horse racing trainer who became engulfed in a doping scandal and was banned from the sport for eight years has appealed his sentence, the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) has confirmed. Mahmood Al Zarooni, who worked at the world famous Godolphin stables in the English town of Newmarket, was banned from horse racing after admitting injecting his thoroughbreds with steroids. The 37-year-old admitted a "catastrophic error" in administering prohibited anabolic steroids -- ethylestranol and stanozolol -- to 15 leading thoroughbreds. All 15 horses, including the former 1,000 Guineas favorite Certify, were banned from racing for six months by the BHA. The case rocked the sport and led to Godolphin principal Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum -- the ruler of Dubai -- shutting down the stables, saying he was "appalled and angered" by the doping revelations. A statement on the BHA's official website read: "Mahmood Al Zarooni has lodged an appeal against the severity of his eight-year suspension from training. "Al Zarooni, 37, was found guilty of administering anabolic steroids to 15 horses in his care at a BHA hearing on April 25. "The former Godolphin handler, who was based at Moulton Paddocks in Newmarket, was officially charged with rule breaches related to prohibited substances, duty to keep medication records, and conduct prejudicial to racing. "He will now contest the length of the eight-year ban, with the date for the appeal hearing to be confirmed in due course." Al Zarooni waived his right to legal representation and accepted all the charges at a hearing in London at the end of April. It led to Sheikh Mohammed locking down the paddocks and issuing a statement. In it he said: "I can assure the racing public that no horse will run from that yard this season until I have been absolutely assured by my team that the entire yard is completely clean." The 63-year-old Sheikh attended Newmarket racecourse on Saturday to see Godolphin colt Dawn Approach win the English 2000 Guineas. According to AFP, Godolphin said Al Zarooni's appeal was nothing to do with them and was simply a matter between him and the BHA. "He is no longer a Godolphin employee and the appeal is a matter between himself and the BHA. Godolphin has no involvement with this appeal," AFP quoted a Godolphin spokesperson as saying. Soon after Al Zarooni's punishment was confirmed a second trainer in Newmarket revealed he was facing an inquiry on similar offenses. The BHA confirmed Gerard Butler was being investigated after some of his horses tested positive for banned substances at his yard in February. Butler told a British newspaper he was facing a ban after injecting his horses with a product used to treat joints but said he was so sure of its validity he entered it into his official medical records which were then sent to the BHA. He called the incident "an unpardonable misjudgment" but said it hadn't crossed his mind there could be a problem with the medication.

chatgpt: Mahmood Al Zarooni, a former horse racing trainer, has appealed an eight-year ban from the sport after admitting to administering anabolic steroids to 15 top thoroughbreds. The horses in question have also been suspended from running for six months. The British Horseracing Authority handed down the ban in 2013 after Al Zarooni's actions came to light during routine drug testing. The trainer had administered steroids to the horses without seeking veterinary advice, in what he has since described as a "catastrophic error". Al Zarooni, who had been considered one of the rising stars of British racing prior to the scandal, has now appealed the length of the ban. The appeal date is yet to be confirmed by the British Horseracing Authority. The case has caused significant controversy in the horse racing world, with some calling for harsher penalties for those found guilty of administering drugs to horses. Others have expressed sympathy for Al Zarooni, suggesting that he may have been misled or pressured by others in the industry. However, the British Horseracing Authority has stood by its decision, insisting that the ban reflects the severity of Al Zarooni's actions. The authority's chief executive, Paul Bittar, stated at the time of the ban that "we cannot have people administering prohibited substances to horses on our watch." The ban has also led to changes in the way horse racing trainers are licensed and regulated. The British Horseracing Authority has introduced tougher rules around the use of drugs in the sport, including requirements for trainers to declare any medications given to horses. Al Zarooni, who was trained by the respected Godolphin stable, has since left the sport but remains a controversial figure. Some have suggested that he was made a scapegoat for wider problems in the horse racing industry, where there are concerns about the use of performance-enhancing drugs. Regardless of the reasons behind the scandal, the case has highlighted the importance of ensuring that the welfare of horses in racing is protected. The British Horseracing Authority and other industry bodies are committed to ensuring that the sport is conducted in a fair and safe manner, and that all participants abide by strict rules around the use of drugs and other substances. As Al Zarooni awaits his appeal, the case continues to generate significant interest in the horse racing world. Many will be watching closely to see how the British Horseracing Authority responds, and what this means for the wider industry.
