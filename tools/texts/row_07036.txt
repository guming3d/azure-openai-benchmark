article: The website of Olympic bobsledder Justin Kripps has been censored by Russia's strict Internet laws while the Canadian is in Sochi for the Winter Games. The heavy-handed censorship has led to speculation as to whether a recent picture of Kripps and his teammates posing bare-chested may have fallen foul of President Putin's anti-gay laws. Kripps had been using the website to keep fans updated on the team's preparations for the Olympics, but when he arrived in Sochi he found access to it had been barred. Scroll down for video . Fans: Justin Kripps, left, and his teammates were voted 'Beards of the Week' by a gay blogger when the Olympic hopeful posted this picture online . When the 27-year-old pilot of Canada's three-man bobsled team tried to log into his website from his cellphone an error message, written in Russian, appeared. Kripps used an online translator to decipher the message and discovered his website had been 'restricted' because it contained information prohibited by Russian law. It is believed the ban could be related to a tweet that Kripps sent on February 6, that linked to a video mocking Russia's homophobic laws. He tweeted: 'This is pretty funny' and linked to a short film made by the Canadian Institute of Diversity as part of its Keep The Games Gay campaign. Kripps had also tweeted a team picture in January, which showed him and his bearded teammates wearing only their underpants.

chatgpt: Canadian bobsledder, Justin Kripps, is facing an unexpected obstacle during the Winter Games in Sochi. Kripps has been barred from accessing his own website, which he had been using to update fans on his team's progress. The website was reportedly shut down due to an alleged violation of the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) rules. Kripps received an error message claiming that the web content was spreading barred information. It remains unclear what specifically led to the website's shutdown, leaving Kripps and his fans in the dark. Kripps, who had been optimistic about the team's performance, expressed his frustration to reporters. "It's disappointing to not be able to connect with fans and share our journey with them," he said. "We put so much work into our training and preparation, and it's a shame that we can't showcase our progress like we had planned." The news was met with disappointment from fans who had been following Kripps' progress through his website. Many expressed their support for the athlete on social media, calling on the IOC to reconsider their decision. The IOC has strict guidelines in place for athletes and their teams during the Olympic Games. These regulations also extend to social media and online presence. As a result, Kripps' case isn't the first of its kind. In the past, athletes have been barred from posting content that may be seen as political or against the Olympic spirit. However, Kripps insisted that the website's content was solely focused on his team's progress and was not in violation of any rules. "We were always careful about what we posted online," Kripps explained. "We were only sharing our journey with fans and trying to keep them updated." Despite this setback, Kripps and his team are still focused on achieving their goals at this year's Olympics. They have been training hard in the lead-up to their events, and Kripps remains optimistic that they will deliver their best performance yet. As for the website, Kripps is hoping that he will be able to regain access and reconnect with his fans soon. "We want to be able to share our journey and inspire others to pursue their own dreams," he said. "Hopefully, we can find a way to do that soon."  In the meantime, fans are left waiting for updates on their favorite bobsledder, hoping to witness his success at the Winter Games in Sochi.
