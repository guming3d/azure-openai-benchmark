The New York City skyline has the ability to take ones breath away at almost any time of day, but it is after dark when the shimmering lights of Manhattan's skyscrapers really stand out against the night sky. Those looking eastwards at the skyline from New Jersey last night were treated to a 'pink moon' rising in between the buildings. Traditionally, the April full moon is known as "the Pink Moon," supposedly as a tribute to the Grass Pink Orchids or Wild Ground Phlox, considered one of the earliest widespread flowers of the spring. The moon is particularly colourful as it is rising or setting for the same reason that sunrise and sunsets are red and orange. When the moon is near the horizon, the moonlight must pass through much more atmosphere than when the moon is directly overhead. The moon appears to glow red as the reflected light from the sun is scattered and refracted by thick layers of atmosphere. By the time the moonlight reaches our eyes, the blue, green, and purple . pieces of visible light have been scattered away by air molecules. That's why you only see yellow, orange, or red. It is also caused by the dust particles and other pollutants in the air. The phenomenon is known as Rayleigh scattering and makes for a beautiful sight both for our eyes and as shown here, the camera lens too!

chatgpt: New York City is currently experiencing a sight to behold as a glorious full moon has risen over its skyline. Unlike its typical appearance, this particular full moon has earned the moniker of the 'Pink Moon', but not for the reasons one might expect. The name derives from the pink flowers of spring, which signals the dawn of a new season. As the moon begins to rise in the post-sunset sky, it takes up a pinkish glow, making it a breathtaking spectacle to watch. The color comes from the scattering of light through the Earth's atmosphere and is accentuated by the moon's position as it rises. The 'Pink Moon' is a rare occurrence, happening only once a year, and is caused by the moon's orbit around the Earth. During this time, it appears larger and brighter than usual, making it a popular sight-seeing attraction.

In many cultures, the full moon is also a symbol of prosperity and prosperity, making the 'Pink Moon' all the more special. In Native American culture, the 'Pink Moon' represents the blooming of pink phlox flowers, which signify the arrival of spring. Similarly, in Japanese culture, the full moon is a symbol of new beginnings, and it is customary to hold festivals and celebrations during this time. Overall, the 'Pink Moon' rising over New York City is a rare and magnificent sight, one that captures the attention and imagination of everyone who witnesses it.
