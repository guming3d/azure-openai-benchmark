Diabetes will cost the NHS more than a sixth of its entire budget by 2035, a report has warned. The disease accounts for 10 per cent (£9.8 billion) of NHS spending, but this is projected to rise to £16.9 billion over the next 25 years, or 17 per cent of the health service's funds. Yet researchers also found that up to four-fifths of the money goes on treating complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage and amputation, which are often preventable. Their Impact Diabetes report, published in the journal Diabetic Medicine, also considered the indirect costs to individuals living with the condition, including those related to increased death and illness, the loss of income from stopping work, and the need for informal care. It found the total associated with these extra burdens in addition to direct patient care in the UK stands at £23.7 billion and is predicted to rise to £39.8 billion by 2035. There are around 3.8 million people living with diabetes in the UK and this is expected to increase to 6.25 million in just over two decades. Barbara Young, chief executive of Diabetes UK, said: 'This report shows that without urgent action, the already huge sums of money being spent on treating diabetes will rise to unsustainable levels that threaten to bankrupt the NHS. 'But the most shocking part of this report is the finding that almost four-fifths of NHS diabetes spending goes on treating complications that in many cases could have been prevented. 'The failure to do more to prevent these complications is both a tragedy for the people involved and a damning indictment of the failure to implement the clear and recommended solutions. Unless the Government and the NHS start to show real leadership on this issue, this unfolding public health disaster will only get worse.' A Department of Health spokeswoman said: 'We agree that diabetes is a very serious illness and one that has a big impact on the NHS. 'That's why we are tackling the disease on three fronts. First, through prevention of Type 2 diabetes - encouraging people to eat well and be more active. Second, by helping people to manage their diabetes through the nine annual health care checks performed in primary care. And by better management of the condition in hospital.' The report was put together by researchers at the York Health Economic . Consortium, in partnership with charities Diabetes UK, the Juvenile . Diabetes Research Foundation and Sanofi Diabetes.

chatgpt: A recent report has revealed that four-fifths of NHS diabetes spending goes towards treating complications as opposed to prevention or treatment of the condition itself. The report, commissioned by Diabetes UK, shows that just £8.2bn of the NHS budget for diabetes goes towards prevention or treatment, while £32bn is spent on complications such as amputations, kidney disease, and heart attacks. The findings are particularly worrying as the number of people with diabetes in the UK is expected to rise from the current figure of 3.8 million to 6.25 million by 2035. The report highlights that the main reason for the high level of complication spending is due to the lack of focus on prevention and early intervention. Barbara Young, chief executive of Diabetes UK, said: "The fact that four-fifths of NHS diabetes spending is going on treating complications is a clear signal that we are not doing enough to prevent people with diabetes from developing devastating and costly complications. Unless we get much better at preventing Type 2 diabetes, we will also see a rise in complications in the years to come." One of the biggest areas of concern highlighted by the report is the high level of diabetes-related amputations. In the UK, there are currently 23 amputations a day carried out on people with diabetes. This is a stark contrast to countries like Sweden and Denmark, where the number of diabetes-related amputations is significantly lower due to their proactive approach to prevention and treatment. The report suggests that the NHS needs to focus on prevention and early intervention in order to reduce the number of complications and ultimately save money. It calls for a national strategy for prevention and early intervention, increased funding for diabetes research, and better education and support for people with the condition. Professor Jonathan Valabhji, national clinical director for Diabetes and Obesity at NHS England, said: "This report shines a light on the challenge we face in tackling diabetes and its complications. As the report highlights, we need to step up efforts to prevent diabetes in the first place, better detect those at high risk of developing diabetes, and improve care and support for all those affected by the condition." The report also highlights the need for greater public awareness about diabetes and its complications. It is hoped that greater understanding of the condition will lead to increased prevention and early intervention and ultimately reduce the number of complications and associated costs. In summary, the report highlights the urgent need for action to prevent and treat diabetes in the UK. With the number of people with the condition expected to rise significantly in the coming years, it is vital that the NHS takes a proactive approach to prevention and early intervention in order to reduce the number of complications and ultimately save money.
