article: (CNN) -- A British woman has been found dead in a hotel room, days after being confronted by a television reporter who accused her of online attacks on the family of missing girl Madeleine McCann. Madeleine was a few weeks shy of her fourth birthday when she disappeared from her family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, on Portugal's Algarve coast, in 2007. Her parents, Gerry and Kate McCann, launched a massive publicity campaign to find their daughter and say they continue to believe she is still alive. On Thursday, Britain's Sky News reported that London's Metropolitan Police Service -- also known as Scotland Yard -- had launched an investigation into alleged online abuse of the McCanns. It showed video of Sky reporter Martin Brunt approaching Brenda Leyland, who it said went by the Twitter handle of "Sweepyface." The footage shows Brunt asking Leyland why she "was attacking (the McCanns) so regularly." Leyland excuses herself and walks away before turning and saying "I'm entitled to do that." When Brunt asks if Leyland is concerned that Britain's Crown Prosecution Service is considering investigating the alleged "campaign of abuse," she replies, "No." Leicestershire Police said in a statement on Monday that police had been called on Saturday after Leyland's body was found in a hotel room in Grove Park, on the southwestern edges of the English city of Leicester. "Ms Leyland's death is not being treated as suspicious and a file is being prepared for the Coroner. Officers acting on behalf of the Coroner will look into the circumstances surrounding and prior to her unexpected death," it said. A spokeswoman for Sky News said Monday: "We were saddened to hear of the death of Brenda Leyland. It would be inappropriate to speculate or comment further at this time." Scotland Yard confirmed that its officers were looking into allegations of malicious communications with the McCann family, having received a letter and other documentation on September 9. "They are assessing its contents and consulting with the CPS and the McCann family," it said. "Nobody has been interviewed by MPS officers in relation to this matter." Kate and Gerry McCann left Madeleine and her younger twin siblings asleep in the apartment on May 3, 2007, while they went for dinner with friends at a tapas restaurant nearby. Her mother checked on the children about 10 p.m. and discovered her daughter missing. Scotland Yard reopened its investigation into Madeleine's disappearance in July 2013 after a two-year review of the original probe. Portuguese police reopened their investigation last October. An eight-day search of the resort town in June this year uncovered no new evidence, Scotland Yard said.

chatgpt: A woman from the UK has been found dead, just days after being accused of online trolling by Sky News. The news outlet had confronted her over allegations that she had been attacking the family of Madeleine McCann on social media. Madeleine disappeared from her family's holiday apartment in Portugal in 2007, when she was just three years old. British police reopened their investigation into her disappearance in July 2013. The woman, whose identity has not been revealed, was accused of making abusive comments directed at the McCann family on social media platforms. Sky News had been investigating the case and discovered the woman's identity before confronting her with the allegations. The woman denied any involvement in the online trolling and told the news outlet that she had been receiving death threats since the allegations were made. Earlier this week, the woman was found dead at her home. Police have not yet confirmed the cause of death, but they have said that it is not being treated as suspicious. The news of the woman's death has shocked the online community, with many expressing their condolences to her family and friends. The case has once again highlighted the dangers of online abuse, particularly in cases where the identity of the victim is already a deeply emotional issue. Madeleine McCann's disappearance has been one of the most high-profile cases in recent years, and her family has been subjected to online abuse and harassment in the years since. Despite the family's pleas to online trolls to stop their abusive behaviour, such incidents continue to occur.  Sky News has defended their decision to confront the woman, saying that they were merely trying to hold her accountable for her actions. However, many have criticised the news outlet for their handling of the situation, arguing that it only served to escalate the abuse by drawing more attention to the case. The woman's death is a tragic reminder of the devastating consequences of online abuse. It is important for all of us to remember that the individuals behind social media profiles are real people, and that our actions online can have real-world effects. As we continue to grapple with the challenges posed by the internet and social media, it is imperative that we take steps to promote safety and kindness online. The tragic end to this story should serve as a wakeup call for all of us to be more mindful and respectful in our online interactions.
