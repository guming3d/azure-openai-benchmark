article: (CNN) -- India has been certified polio-free by the World Health Organization after going three years without an endemic case of polio. The eradication of polio in India is heralded as one of the biggest achievements in global health efforts. The polio-free certification by the Regional Certification Commission came Thursday, along with a proclamation that Southeast Asia is free of the disease. Just five years ago, India was home to nearly half the global polio cases and considered one of the most technically difficult places to eradicate the disease, because of sanitation challenges and high-density population. India's last case was reported in a young girl paralyzed by polio in West Bengal in January 2011. Meet the last person to have polio in India . So how did the second most populous country in the world, considered the hardest place to end polio, become free of the disease? Health workers determined that the children of migrants or those growing up in difficult-to-reach areas were not getting access to vaccines. So they deployed immunization efforts to reach the most vulnerable, according to UNICEF. India launched a massive effort involving a surveillance network and almost 2.3 million vaccine administrators, who identified communities falling through the cracks. To counter rumors and misgivings about the vaccine, social mobilizers, religious leaders and parents were included to increase understanding about immunizations. They also bolstered communication and outreach efforts that often included Bollywood celebrities and cricket players. The efforts combined government, various U.N. agencies as well as philanthropic organizations. The highly infectious viral disease primarily affects young children and could lead to paralysis and death. It can be prevented through immunization, but there is no cure. The incidence of the disease has dropped by more than 99% since 1988. It remains endemic in three countries -- Pakistan, Nigeria and Afghanistan -- down from more than 125 countries in 1988. Vaccinating children against polio can be a deadly job . Polio workers in those countries have been facing violence as some militant groups have begun targeting anti-polio campaigns.

chatgpt: India was previously known as one of the world's hotspots for the widespread occurrence of polio, but recent reports indicate a significant achievement in the fight against the disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) officially certified India as a polio-free nation on Thursday, marking the end of a long and challenging battle that lasted for more than two decades. India's last case of polio was recorded on January 13, 2011, and since then, the country has not had any new cases. This is a remarkable feat considering the fact that India had thousands of polio cases each year before the launch of the polio eradication program. The campaign involved the use of polio vaccines and strict surveillance measures. India's success in eradicating polio is a huge milestone in the global efforts to combat the disease. Polio is a highly infectious disease that can cause paralysis and even death. It mainly affects children under the age of five, and is transmitted through contaminated drinking water and food. The WHO has been working extensively to eradicate polio worldwide since 1988, and the success in India is a major step towards achieving this goal. India's polio eradication program was implemented by the government and supported by numerous international organizations and donor agencies. The WHO provided technical assistance, while the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) facilitated the procurement and distribution of vaccines. The program was also aided by thousands of health workers who went door-to-door to administer the vaccine to children. The end of polio in India is a testament to the hard work and dedication of all those involved in the fight against the disease. The success in India shows that eradication is possible, even in countries with the most challenging conditions. It also highlights the importance of continued investment in immunization programs and surveillance systems to ensure that the virus does not return. The certification by the WHO is a great victory for India and a proud moment for all those involved in the fight against polio. It is also a significant milestone in global health efforts and a step closer to a polio-free world. The WHO has now called upon other countries to follow in India's footsteps and intensify their efforts towards eradicating polio.  In conclusion, India's polio-free certification is a significant achievement and an inspiration that other countries can emulate. With continued support and investment, the world can work towards eradication of polio and create a healthier future for all.
