Dracula looms over the anti-Vampire weaponry on show in the gothic exhibition in the British Library, in London . Curator Greg Buzwell said: 'They really do exist and we're very fortunate and lucky to have this.

There is no real evidence of them existing prior to about 1970.' Mr Buzwell said he could only speculate as to how many were made and for whom. 'There are 60 or 70 of them thought to be in existence. We think probably a lot of them were maybe made for eccentric collectors. Wallace and Gromit Were-Rabbit also on display in the Terror and Wonder: The Gothic Imagination exhibition .
