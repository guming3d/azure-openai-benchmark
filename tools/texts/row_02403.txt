article: A Florida police officer is on paid leave and facing an internal affairs investigation after a video captured him shooting a 62-year-old woman in the back with a stun gun Tuesday. Viola Young approached officers shortly after they had taken three individuals into custody on a narrow Tallahassee street close to the governor's mansion. She can be heard on a video apparently shot with a cellphone from a neighbor's porch shouting 'I have some some questions.' Scroll down for video . Tased: Viola Young, 62, was hit in the back with a stun gun after Officer Terry Mahan ordered her to back away and tried to grab her arm . The officer by the vehicle closest to Young tells her to stay back as Officer Terry Mahan walks from the other end of the street. He reaches out to grab her arm but Young twists away from him. As she looks to be walking away, Mahan raises his stun gun and fires into Young's back, causing the woman to fall face first into the road. Tallahassee Police Chief Michael DeLeo announced at a late-night press conference after the department had obtained and reviewed the video. 'Based on the video, I have enough concerns to call for an internal investigation,' DeLeo said. 'We will conduct a thorough investigation into this incident. We want to be transparent with the community by sharing what we can at this point, including the video.' Voices in the video can be heard advising Young not to approach officers and after she falls to the ground, the person with the cellphone says police 'tased a lady for nothing.' Young was handcuffed on the ground as officers walked over to Young to help her up and escort her to a squad car. Citizen: A neighbor shot what appears to be cellphone video of the moment where Young was hit by the stun gun and collapsed to the pavement . According to police, Young was medically cleared by paramedics and charged with resisting and obstructing an officer without violence. The first-degree misdemeanor carries a sentence of up to 12 months in jail or a fine of up to $1000. Young told the Associated Press her attorney instructed her not to speak about the incident. The Tallahassee Democrat reports Chuck Hobbs, a Tallahassee attorney, wrote a letter to State Attorney Willie Meggs asking him to 'strongly consider' charges against Mahan. 'I am asking you to strongly consider filing charges directly,' the letter stated, 'if you and your top investigators conclude that this incident was unjustified.' Tallahassee police have been scrutinized in recent months. In September, the city settled for $475,000 in a case where a woman had her nose broken following an arrest and an altercation with officers. The arrest of Christina West last year was also filmed, showing officers throwing her against a police car and then onto the ground as West screams. West can be heard screaming in the video. A grand jury declined to press charges against officers.

chatgpt: In a startling incident in Tallahassee, police officers were filmed using excessive force on a woman who approached them while they were making arrests. Viola Young, who happened to be in the area, approached the officers to ask what was happening, when one of them suddenly reached out and grabbed her arm. As she tried to walk away, Officer Terry Mahan shot her in the back with a stun gun. The shocking footage shows the woman falling face-first into the road. Despite being initially unresponsive, Viola Young was later cleared by paramedics. The incident has sparked outrage among residents of Tallahassee, who are now demanding answers from the police department. Police say that officers were in the area responding to reports of drug activity when they made the arrests. However, many people are questioning why such extreme use of force was necessary, particularly when the woman posed no threat to the officers. The incident has raised serious concerns about police accountability and the need for better training when it comes to interactions with the public. Advocates for police reform are calling for an investigation into the incident, as well as a review of police policies and practices. In a statement, Tallahassee police chief Lawrence Revell said he was "deeply troubled" by the video footage and that he had launched an internal investigation into the matter. He added that the department was committed to transparency and accountability and that any officer found to have acted improperly would face consequences. The incident has also highlighted the need for greater community involvement in policing. Some residents say they have long felt targeted by police and that incidents like the one involving Viola Young are all too common in their neighborhoods. "I'm not surprised by what happened," said local activist Malik Johnson. "It's just another example of how police treat people in our community. We need to hold them accountable and demand real change." The use of force by police has become a contentious issue in recent years, particularly in light of high-profile incidents involving the deaths of unarmed civilians. Many advocates are calling for systemic changes to how police operate, including increased use of non-lethal force and greater community involvement in decision-making. Meanwhile, Viola Young's family says they are still shaken by what happened and are calling for justice. "We want answers," said her sister, Vanessa Young. "We want to know why this happened and why the police thought it was necessary to use such extreme force. My sister could have been seriously injured or even killed." The incident remains under investigation, and it is unclear what actions, if any, will be taken against the officers involved. However, the incident has served as a stark reminder of the need for greater police accountability and reform, particularly when it comes to interactions with minority communities.
