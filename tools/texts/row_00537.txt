article: (CNN) -- The Raspberry Pi is all the rage for hobbyists in search of cheap, credit card-sized computers that can run a full PC operating system. Arduino boards have been around nearly a decade, meanwhile, powering robots and all sorts of other creative electronics projects. Now, a project called UDOO ("you do") seeks to bring the best elements of Raspberry Pi and Arduino together into a single mini-PC that can run either Android or Linux. "With UDOO, we want to combine the winning characteristics of Arduino and Raspberry Pi in one single board. The simplicity of Arduino in managing sensors, combined with the flexibility of a microcomputer based on ARM are integrated in UDOO, giving you a powerful prototyping board able to run Linux or Android," UDOO project coordinator Bruno Sinopli, a Carnegie Mellon professor in electrical and computer engineering, said in a video on UDOO's Kickstarter page. UDOO-based projects demonstrated in the video included a camera-equipped toy car controlled remotely with a tablet, programming education for kids, and a video game involving players running on equipment reminiscent of the Wii Balance Board. Touchscreens and various other types of sensors can be connected to the UDOO. "Want to build an LED light-controller, an RFID reader, or a creative game controller? UDOO allows you to create any kind of project and share it with the community," the Kickstarter page states. "Combining the flexibility of Arduino with the power of Android or Linux, you can create and update tons of stand-alone solutions without worrying about the linking between the two worlds and their wiring." UDOO's designers claim the board will have "the power of four Raspberry Pis," apparently in reference to the quad-core chip (the Raspberry Pi uses a single-core). The UDOO also has twice as much RAM (1GB) and Gigabit Ethernet as opposed to the Pi's 100 Megabit Ethernet. The Raspberry Pi has the UDOO beat on price, though, with models selling for $25 or $35. The UDOO was seeking $27,000 to jump start development of the computer. It has already received over $250,000 with 46 days of funding still to go. COPYRIGHT 2011 ARSTECHNICA.COM .

chatgpt: UDOO raises $95,000 in 6 days on Kickstarter for powerful mini PC UDOO, a new mini PC that combines the power of four Raspberry Pis and an Arduino, has raised $95,000 in just six days on Kickstarter. The project marks a new milestone in the evolution of the Raspberry Pi, which has already become a phenomenon in the maker community. UDOO is designed as a powerful prototyping board for software development and design. The mini PC is intended to provide the computing muscle necessary to run a variety of applications, including machine learning, automation, robotics, and more. According to the UDOO campaign page, the powerful mini PC is designed for both Android and Linux operating systems. This means developers and designers can use UDOO as a powerful platform to test and experiment with their software and hardware designs. The UDOO mini PC is powered by a quad-core ARM Cortex-A15 CPU running at 1.8 GHz, paired with a quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 CPU running at 1.2 GHz. It also includes a programmable FPGA and an integrated 2D/3D graphics accelerator, which makes it capable of running complex and demanding applications. UDOO is designed to be a powerful, yet affordable platform for prototyping and experimentation. The mini PC is priced at $99 for the basic model, with the high-end model costing $299. The high-end model includes a 64-bit ARM Cortex-A53 CPU running at 1.5 GHz, 4 GB of RAM, and an integrated graphics card. The UDOO Kickstarter campaign has already surpassed its funding goal of $20,000. The company has received support from more than 300 backers, and there are still 24 days left to go in the campaign. UDOO is a promising platform for makers and developers who want to experiment with new software and hardware designs. With its powerful computing capabilities and flexible operating system support, UDOO is poised to become a popular choice for the maker community.
