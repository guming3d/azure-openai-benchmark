chatgpt: Abdullah bin Fandi Al Shammari, a Saudi Arabian citizen who was sentenced to death in 1983 for killing a man with a stick following a heated argument, has been executed. He had been spared from the gallows while the victim's relatives were asked to grant a pardon, and the victim's sons had to come of age to decide whether to accept blood money. During his time in prison, he learned the Quran and was described as the "ideal inmate." However, his sentence was finally carried out, bringing the total number of executions in Saudi Arabia to 10 for the year. Mr. Shammari had been on death row for nearly four decades before he was executed for his crime. Despite pleas from human rights organizations to commute his sentence, the Saudi government proceeded with his execution. Similar to other cases, the government claimed that their legal system adheres to Islamic law - sharia - and that they have provided fair trials according to international law. The death penalty in Saudi Arabia is known for its strict application, including executions for drug offenses and apostasy. The country has faced international criticism for its use of capital punishment, and human rights organizations have repeatedly accused Saudi Arabia of carrying out unfair trials, including denial of the right to legal counsel. While Mr. Shammari's execution was carried out in accordance with Saudi law, his case has sparked debate over the use of capital punishment. Many have criticized the country's legal system, citing concerns over the lack of transparency and due process rights. Despite these criticisms, however, the Saudi government has consistently defended its use of the death penalty as a necessary measure to maintain law and order. Saudi officials have argued that capital punishment is used only against defendants who have committed serious crimes, and only after fair and transparent trials. Critics argue, however, that Saudi Arabia's legal system is far from transparent, with many defendants facing trial without the right to legal representation. Additionally, many argue that the country's interpretation of Islamic law is too severe, resulting in executions for relatively minor offenses. Regardless of these concerns, the Saudi government shows no signs of slowing down its use of the death penalty. With 10 executions already carried out this year, it appears that the country will continue to use capital punishment as a means of maintaining law and order, despite the concerns of international human rights organizations.
