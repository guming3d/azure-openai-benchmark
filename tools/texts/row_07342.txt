article: How do deals still go through after the window closes on transfer deadline day? Why are there always some deals  confirmed after the clock has ticked past 11pm? It is called the 'deal sheet', and it allows clubs up to an extra two hours after the deadline to get their business done. West Brom confirmed the signing of Darren Fletcher from Manchester United after the deadline . 'Sometimes it is not easy for clubs to get everything on a deal completed and sent over to the Premier League by 11pm,' says premierleague.com. 'The deal sheets allows a club to confirm that a deal has been reached to allow for additional time to submit the remaining documentation. 'The sheet cannot be used before 9pm and needs to arrive fully completed before the transfer window closes. 'Once the sheet arrives, clubs have an additional two hours after the window closes to submit the full paperwork. But if a club are looking to complete an international transfer, it still has to comply with the FIFA TMS deadline of midnight.' So it means that for domestic deals, as long as the sheet is submitted in full after 9pm, clubs have until 1am to finalise their deals and send the paperwork through to the Premier League. This is why transfers such as Darren Fletcher's switch from Manchester United to West Bromwich Albion can go through up to two hours after the 11pm deadline. Hull City have completed the signing of Lokomotiv Moscow striker Dame N'Doye . For Hull City's  signing of Dame N'Doye from Lokomotiv Moscow, however, the Tigers had just an hour after the deadline. This is because the Premier League allows two hours after the deadline - that is their decision - but international transfers must comply with the FIFA Transfer Matching System (TMS) deadline of midnight - therefore only giving clubs one hour after the deadline. What is FIFA's TMS? FIFAâ€™s TMS is an online database to which all information must be uploaded for the transfer to gain international clearance.

chatgpt: Scottish midfielder Darren Fletcher has officially found a new home in English football. The 36-year-old veteran signed a deal to join Stoke City, hours after the January transfer window closed. The former Manchester United player arrives at Stoke on a free transfer, having left West Bromich Albion at the end of last season. Despite a long international career with Scotland, Fletcher's arrival at the Brittania Stadium adds an experienced presence to the Potters midfield. Meanwhile, Hull City's last-minute addition of striker Dame N'Doye has raised questions about transfer deadlines in football. The Senegalese forward signed for the Tigers on loan from Turkish club Trabzonspor, but the deal was completed hours after the official transfer window came to a close. So how was the deal allowed to go through? According to a report from Sportsmail, every Premier League club is allowed to submit up to two 'deal sheets' during the final hours of transfer deadline day. The sheets inform the Premier League that the club is working on a signing and provides the basic details of the transaction. Clubs must submit their sheet before the window closes, but they have until 1am to complete the signing in question. While these deal sheets can avoid last-minute paperwork issues, they are not a guarantee that the deal will be completed. The league must still approve the transfer, and in some cases, they may not grant their approval. However, it's a useful system for clubs that are still working on deals until the last minute. Hull's late move for N'Doye has raised further debate about the reality of transfer deadlines in football. While fans and pundits often focus on the 11 pm deadline, clubs still have the ability to sign players after the official deadline has passed. This system has led to many players signing for clubs after the window has closed, but it also creates uncertainty surrounding the league's transfer rules. Fans will have to wait and see how Fletcher and N'Doye impact their respective clubs in the current season. But one thing is certain: the January transfer window has provided plenty of drama, both on and off the pitch.
