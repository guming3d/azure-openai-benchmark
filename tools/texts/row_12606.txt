article: (CNN) -- In a letter to the NCAA disclosed Wednesday, the Justice Department said it has received several requests for an antitrust investigation into the current Bowl Championship Series system, and it wants information to help it decide what to do. That controversial system makes it very difficult for teams in some athletic conferences to qualify for major bowl games, potentially costing millions of dollars in revenue to those not chosen. "Serious questions continue to arise suggesting that the current BCS system may not be conducted consistent with the competition principles expressed in federal antitrust laws," Assistant Attorney General Christine Varney told NCAA President Mark Emmert. The decision to release the letter came hours after Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, a major opponent of the current system, demanded further consideration of the issue in a face-to-face appearance with Attorney General Eric Holder at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. Holder responded by disclosing the Justice Department had sent a letter to the NCAA on the issue Tuesday. In her letter, Varney asked Emmert to explain why college football does not have a playoff when so many other college sports do. She also asked what steps, if any, the NCAA has taken to create a playoff, and whether the NCAA has determined that there are aspects of the BCS system that do not serve interests of fans, colleges, universities, and players. Officials acknowledge the NCAA is not legally required to respond, although lawyers following the case expect the association to do so. Antitrust lawyers have been watching the debate grow for more than two years, to see whether the Justice Department will jump into the case. One antitrust expert who declares himself neutral in the case says he doubts Justice will launch a probe because it has a full plate of more pressing issues. "There is a problem, but not an antitrust problem," said Gordon Schnell of the New York firm Constantine Cannon. A court could never require a football playoff, but they could break up the current BCS system, he said. Currently, the BCS system limits automatic bids to the winners of the Big Ten, Big East, Big 12, Atlantic Coast Conference, Pac 10 and the Southeast Conference, thereby leaving out other conferences, including almost all schools in the Rocky Mountain Region. Only two remaining at-large spots are available to all other colleges and universities. CNN's Terry Frieden contributed to this report .

chatgpt: The Bowl Championship Series, more commonly known as the BCS, is one of the most controversial systems in college football. While it showcases some of the best teams in the country, it also makes it incredibly difficult for certain teams to qualify. This has led to a significant amount of scrutiny in recent days, with millions of dollars in revenue at stake. Assistant Attorney General Varney is one of the latest individuals to take issue with the BCS system. According to sources, Varney has sought an explanation for why some college teams have been left out of the bowl selection process. He has reportedly raised concerns that the process is not transparent and may be favoring certain teams over others. While the BCS system was established with the intention of selecting the best teams to compete, it has been criticized for its complex algorithm and subjective criteria. The system takes into account a variety of factors, but many have argued that it is flawed and often produces biased results. Part of the controversy surrounding the BCS system is linked to the massive revenue generated by college football bowl games. Bowl games are highly lucrative, with millions of dollars in advertising, broadcast rights, and ticket sales at stake. For teams that have qualified for the BCS, the financial reward can be significant. However, for those that have been left out, the financial impact can be devastating. In recent years, there has been a growing chorus of voices advocating for reform of the BCS system. Critics argue that the system is outdated and should be replaced with a playoff format. A playoff would ensure that the best teams have a clear path to the championship and would generate even more revenue for the sport. As the debate over the BCS continues, it remains to be seen what action Assistant Attorney General Varney will take. His office has declined to comment on the matter, but sources suggest that he is closely monitoring the situation. Regardless of Varney's actions, it is clear that the BCS and the college football bowl selection process will remain under scrutiny for the foreseeable future. In conclusion, the BCS system has come under fire for making it hard for some college football teams to qualify, with millions of dollars in revenue at stake. With Assistant Attorney General Varney seeking an explanation, the controversy surrounding the BCS is only likely to intensify. As college football fans and stakeholders continue to debate the merits of the BCS system, it is clear that change is on the horizon.
