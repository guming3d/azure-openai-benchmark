article: (CNN) -- Substitute Javier Hernandez scored a late header as champions Manchester United fought back from three goals down to earn a remarkable 3-3 Premier League draw at Chelsea on Sunday. On a bitterly cold afternoon in south-west London, United knew they needed a victory at Stamford Bridge to keep pace with rivals Manchester City at the top of the table. But they got off to a poor start and went into the interval a goal behind after defender Johnny Evans had inadvertently turned Daniel Sturridge's cross into his own net. And United then suffered a double blow early in the second half as two goals in the space of just five minutes looked to have handed Chelsea victory. With the second 45 minutes barely a minute old, Fernando Torres' crash was superbly volleyed home by fellow-Spaniard Juan Mata to double Chelsea's lead. And United's defense was found wanting again soon afterwards when David Luiz was left unmarked to head home a free-kick. The visitors had been denied two first-half penalty appeals by referee Howard Webb, but the World Cup final official had no hesitation in pointing to the spot when Sturridge fouled Patrice Evra in the area. Wayne Rooney smashed home the 58th minute spot-kick to make it 3-1 and Rooney again held his nerve from the spot just 11 minutes later, this time Branislav Ivanovic was adjudged to have tripped Danny Welbeck. By now United were in the ascendency, and they drew level when Hernandez found space in the area to head home Ryan Giggs' cross from close range six minutes from time. However, only a superb flying save from much-criticized United goalkeeper David de Gea, to keep out Mata's last-minute free-kick, ensured the points were shared. Despite the fightback, United lose ground in the title race, with City now two points ahead of their rivals, with a much better goal difference as well. Chelsea remain in fourth place on 43 points, but Newcastle are now only a point behind in fifth after their Senegalese international strikers combined to beat Aston Villa 2-1. Demba Ba scored his 16th goal of the season, second only to Arsenal's Robin van Persie, to give Newcastle the lead, only for Robbie Keane to level for Villa from close range. But debutant Papiss Demba Cisse secured the three points for Newcastle with a stunning strike that arrowed into the top corner of the Villa net with 19 minutes remaining.

chatgpt: Manchester United showcased their fighting spirit as they clawed their way back from a 3-0 deficit to secure a dramatic draw against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Thanks to two Wayne Rooney penalties and an incredible goal from his center-forward partner, Robin van Persie, the Red Devils earned a share of the spoils and kept their title hopes alive. It all started so poorly for United as Chelsea surged into a commanding lead in the first half. United's traditionally stingy defense simply crumbled under the weight of the home side's attacking prowess, as Chelsea netted three goals in the opening 50 minutes. But despite the scoreline, United refused to give up and mounted a spirited comeback. Their first glimmer of hope came in the form of a Rooney penalty after 57 minutes, which displayed the England international's steadfast determination as he made no mistake from the spot. The momentum started to build for the visitors, and their attacking play began to bear fruit. They piled the pressure on Chelsea's defense, and it eventually paid off when Van Persie produced an absolute stunner of a goal in the 74th minute. The Dutchman picked up a cleverly disguised pass from Rooney and hammered a first-time volley past Chelsea keeper, Petr Cech – a goal that will be remembered for years to come. With time running out, United gave everything they had to find a winner, but Chelsea held firm to secure a point. Despite the setback, the draw sees United remain two points behind league leaders Manchester City, who had earlier defeated Newcastle in a hard-fought match. And speaking of Newcastle, they continued their impressive run of form with a 2-1 victory over Aston Villa, moving them up to fifth in the Premier League table, just one point behind Chelsea. The Magpies showed their mettle with goals from Papiss Cisse and Yohan Cabaye – the latter being an outrageous free-kick from long range that left Villa keeper Brad Guzan hapless. Overall, it was a thrilling weekend of Premier League action, with plenty of twists and turns along the way. Manchester United proved that they are still a force to be reckoned with, while Newcastle demonstrated that they are a team on the rise. It sets up a fascinating next round of fixtures, with everything still to play for in what has already been a fantastic season.
