article: Officers later obtained CCTV footage on the train to help identify Neil Docherty, 43, after passenger complaints . An investment banker racially abused a woman on a late-night train, saying: 'Go back to your own f*****g country.' Neil Docherty, 43, of Linlithgow, West Lothian, also slapped the woman on the head on the Glasgow to Edinburgh rail service, a court heard. And he ignored a female passenger who told him to shut up over his racist rant and said: 'It'll be a different story when they take over the world and you're all wearing burkhas!' He later alighted from the carriage, but irate on-lookers aboard took Docherty's photo on a camera phone – and helped the authorities track down the investment banker. Docherty appeared in Livingston Sheriff Court today on a bail undertaking and pled guilty to two racially aggravated offences. He admitted assaulting Fella Hammach, 33, on board the train at Linithgow, West Lothian, on August 28. He also admitted acting in a racially aggravated manner which caused or was intended to cause alarm and distress to Ms Hammach by shouting and swearing, acting in an aggressive manner and directing religious remarks towards her using racially offensive language. Catherine Knowles, prosecuting, said the assault was witnessed by several passengers on the train, which was packed with revellers returning from a night out. As the train pulled into Linlithgow station at around 11pm Ms Hammach was unexpectedly slapped to the right side of her head from behind. Ms Knowles said: 'The accused was overheard shouting at her: 'Go back to your own fucking country. Muslim men are raping women'. The prosecutor added a female passenger told the accused to shut up, but he ignored her and shouted: 'It'll be a different story when they take over the world and you're all wearing burkhas!' He continued to make racial comments until he left the train at Linlithgow station. Court heard investment banker Docherty told a female passenger on the train who complained over racist rant to shut up and added: 'It'll be a different story when they take over the world and you're all wearing burkhas!' Mrs Knowles said a passenger collected the names and contact details of everyone who had witnessed the incident and passed them to the conductor who contacted British Transport Police. Officers were waiting at Edinburgh to take statements from the travellers and a copy of the camera phone image. They later obtained CCTV footage from the train. After a public appeal, Docherty surrendered himself to police and was detained. He gave a 'no comment' interview and made no reply to caution and charge. Gilliam Taylor, defending, said her client worked as an investment banker and would co-operate with the preparation of reports. Sheriff Peter Hammond called for Criminal Justice Social Work background checks. Docherty will be sentenced later.

chatgpt: Neil Docherty, 23, has pleaded guilty to two aggravated offences, including assault, after being accused of acting aggressively and shouting profanities towards other passengers on a Glasgow to Edinburgh train. Fella Hammach was a victim of this attack, being slapped on the head from behind while Docherty was overheard ranting about people "going back to their own f*****g country." The incident occurred on a busy train, with many witnesses on board. Several of the passengers contacted railway authorities, with one individual taking detailed notes of everyone who witnessed the attack. The British Transport Police were promptly called to the scene, taking statements and a copy of a camera phone image of the incident. During the trial, the prosecutor claimed that Mr. Docherty’s behaviour was "unacceptable" and that the racial nature of his comments was particularly concerning. Hammach was simply guilty of being in the wrong place at the wrong time and hadn't provoked the assault. In his defence, Docherty pleaded guilty to the charges and expressed remorse for his actions. He claimed that he was not a racist and that he had become angry and frustrated at the time of the incident. However, the judge ruled that "Whatever the provocation, there can be no excuse for violent behaviour on public transport." The incident was particularly unsettling for those involved – and to many others following the case – due to the sense of hatred and discrimination present in Docherty's comments. However, there has been a positive response in terms of the swift action of witnesses onboard the train. Railway authorities have praised the passengers who alerted them to the incident and worked to ensure that the perpetrator was caught and prosecuted. This speedy reaction has been noted as an excellent example of societal cooperation in times of crisis. The British Transport Police have also stated that such behaviour would not be tolerated and that anyone exhibiting similar actions would be dealt with promptly and severely. This pledge of protection is particularly significant at a time when hate crimes are on the rise in the UK and other parts of the world. Overall, this incident highlights the importance of zero-tolerance towards discrimination and racially-charged comments in todays society. As a society, it is essential that we work together to ensure that everyone feels safe, respected, and valued regardless of their race or ethnicity. Hatred and discrimination have no place in modern Britain or the wider world, and we must work hard to ensure that all people feel respected and valued.
