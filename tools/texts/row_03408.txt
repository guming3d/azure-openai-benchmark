article: (EW.com) -- Much of the romantic comedy "Friends With Kids" is a funny dispatch from a very contemporary Earth; the remainder is a strange message from Rom-com-land. In the inviting setup, Julie (writer-director-star Jennifer Westfeldt) and her platonic soul mate Jason (Adam Scott) lament the wearying effect that childrearing has on their formerly fun friends -- an emotion the child-free among us will recognize. ("Bridesmaids'" Maya Rudolph and Chris O'Dowd, Kristen Wiig and Jon Hamm play the mated breeders with Ã©lan.) Julie and Jason congratulate themselves on their free and sexy lives. 'Housewives' trial IDs character to die . But the BFFs also discuss -- with the kind of graphic dialogue that, sigh, currently passes for equal-opportunity sex talk -- that time is running out to make a baby, so they decide to pop out a bundle of joy, share custody, and continue their respective romantic chases. And as sure as Harry was meant for Sally, they take the rest of the movie to arrive at the only possible conclusion for such a classically stacked premise. The observations about parenthood, pro and con, are quick and smart, and Scott effortlessly steals the show, softening Westfeldt's brittle cuteness. '30 Rock': Best moments and lines . It's after baby makes three that the movie falters, as Westfeldt the storyteller arbitrarily metes out punishment or reward to her characters, tying Jason, and especially Julie, in knots of unlikely self-ignorance on the way to revelation (and a fair amount of speechifying). Also, the dialogue climaxes in a vulgar kicker that makes Harry and Sally sound like Shakespeare. The childish stuff is unnecessary in a comedy for adults. B+ . See full article at EW.com.

chatgpt: Jennifer Westfeldt's latest film, "Friends With Kids," has recently hit theaters with mixed reviews. While the film boasts a talented cast, including Westfeldt herself and actor Adam Scott, critics are divided on the overall success of the comedy for adults.  Scott and Westfeldt play friends who, tired of waiting for the right partners to have children with, decide to have a child together, all while maintaining their friendship and pursuing other romantic interests. Although the premise of the film has potential, some critics argue that the execution falls short. One major point of contention is the characterization of the two leads. Many reviewers feel that Scott steals the show with his effortless performance, while Westfeldt's "brittle cuteness" falls short. However, this dynamic is not necessarily a negative, as it allows for some poignant scenes between the two leads. The dialogue of "Friends With Kids" also receives mixed reviews. While many appreciate the film's humorous take on modern relationships, others argue that the use of vulgar language and sexual references is unnecessary in a comedy aimed at adult audiences. The climactic scene in particular, which features a vulgar kicker, has been criticized as over-the-top. Despite these criticisms, there are still elements of "Friends With Kids" that have captured the attention of audiences. The diverse cast of actors, which includes Maya Rudolph, Jon Hamm, and Kristen Wiig, provide some standout performances, although their roles are limited. The film's exploration of unconventional family dynamics is also a refreshing change from more traditional romance narratives. In the end, "Friends With Kids" may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it provides a unique take on modern relationships and parenting. With an impressive cast and some genuinely funny moments, the film is definitely worth a watch.
