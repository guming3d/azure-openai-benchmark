article: Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- At least three Thai soldiers were killed Friday in a new round of clashes with Cambodian troops in a disputed border region, a military official said. Thirteen other Thai troops were injured, Lt. Col. Siriya Khuangsirikul said. The fighting broke out near two temples in the Phanom Dong Rak of southeastern Thailand's Surin province, Thai army spokesman Col. Sunsern Kaewkumnerd said. A Cambodian foreign ministry spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment. Authorities evacuated between 7,000 and 10,000 residents to temporary shelters as clashes erupted, Ong-art Klarmpaibul of the Thai prime minister's office said in an interview with the Thai Public Broadcasting System. Sunsern said the cause of Friday's clashes "is not yet known." At least 10 people were killed when renewed fighting flared up in another disputed border area between the two nations in February, prompting the U.N. Security Council to issue a statement calling on both sides to implement a permanent cease-fire and "resolve the situation peacefully and through effective dialogue." Those clashes, which lasted four days, stemmed from a longstanding conflict related to the 11th-century Preah Vihear temple. Both Cambodia and Thailand lay claim to the temple, which sits atop a cliff on Cambodian soil but has its most accessible entrance on the Thai side. At the time, each nation accused the other of firing first, according to a statement from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Conflict over the site has taken place periodically for years. In 1962, the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, ruled that the site was in Cambodia, adding that the structure was "an outstanding masterpiece of Khmer architecture." But Thailand says the 1.8-square-mile (4.7-square-kilometer) area around Preah Vihear was never fully demarcated, and blames a map drawn at the beginning of the 20th-century during the French occupation of Cambodia. CNN's Kocha Olarn contributed to this report.

chatgpt: At least 7,000 people have been evacuated as clashes broke out between Thai and Cambodian troops in a disputed border area. The fighting claimed three Thai soldiers' lives and injured 13 others. The cause of the clashes is not known yet, according to a Thai military spokesman. However, it comes more than two months after prior clashes erupted in another disputed border area. The Thai military has already evacuated residents from villages in the vicinity of the clash zone. Furthermore, local schools have been closed, and parents have been urged to keep their children at home. The two countries have a long-standing territorial dispute over land next to their border. The area where the recent clash occurred is around the 11th-century Preah Vihear Temple. The temple has been a source of tension and conflict between the two countries for years. At the moment, both countries have provided different information about the incident, with Cambodia claiming that they responded to Thai aggression. In contrast, Thailand alleges that Cambodia launched the attack. The United Nations has called for an immediate ceasefire and urged both countries to resolve their differences through peaceful means. They called on them to continue working with the International Court of Justice to resolve the ongoing territorial dispute that has caused these tensions. The border dispute between Thailand and Cambodia has been ongoing for many years, and troops have frequently clashed in the disputed region. However, this recent clash has caused significant concern for both countries, who have promised to work together to de-escalate the tensions and prevent further violence.
