article: (CNN)  -- Caroline Wozniacki moved a win nearer to reclaiming the world number one spot from Kim Clijsters but her passage to the last 16 in Dubai only came after her Russian opponent, Anna Chakvetadze, fainted on court. Chakvetadze was serving to level their match at one set all when she collapsed and fell to the ground. Wozniacki and courtside officials all rushed to help Chakvetadze, who eventually came around but played just one more point before wisely retiring. Wozniacki, who took the first set 6-1 but trailed 3-5 in the second, was shocked by the incident. "It was scary. She is a good friend of mine, but to see anyone collapse on the other side of the net is not a good sight. It was quite a surprise," she told AFP. Chakvetadze, who put out Pattaya Open winner Daniela Hantuchova in the first round, was later diagnosed with a gastro-intestinal illness. Wozniacki, who needs to reach the semifinals in Dubai to dislodge Australian Open champion Clijsters, next plays Ayumi Morita as the Japanese qualifier continued her superb run. Morita beat Clijsters' Paris final conqueror Petra Kvitova in the first round and followed that up Wednesday with a straight sets win over Sania Mirza, the Indian star now based in Dubai. Morita eased to a 6-4 6-2 win while Russia's Svetlana Kuznetsova earned another meeting with Francesca Schiavone of Italy. Kuznetsova lost to the French Open winner in the longest women's match in grand slam history in last month's Australian Open, four hours 44 minutes. Kuznetsova needed two-hours 30 minutes to beat Tavetona Pironkova by 5-7 6-2 6-3 to earn a chance of revenge. "I think every single person who knows me watch that match in Melbourne came to me and said it was a great match," Kuznetsova said. Meanwhile, Britain's Andy Murray has withdrawn from next week's ATP tournament in Dubai, citing a wrist injury. Murray, beaten in the final of the Australian Open by Novak Djokovic, played last week in Rotterdam, but was well below his best and won only five games in losing his first-round clash to Marcos Baghdatis. His withdrawal will mean the 23-year-old is not due to play again until the Masters Series event in Indian Wells in the middle of next month. "Andy would like to apologize to both the tournament and its fans," he told his official website. Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal are among the entries for the popular tournament.

chatgpt: Former world number one Caroline Wozniacki has come closer to reclaiming her title after moving to the last 16 at the Dubai Tennis Championships. The Danish star's opponent, Anna Chakvetadze, fainted on the court during their match and retired from the game after being treated for a stomach upset. Wozniacki managed to secure the win with the score 6-1, 6-1. The victory places Wozniacki just two wins away from regaining the top spot in the world rankings, a position she held briefly in 2010. Her current form suggests that she is on track to achieve this goal, having already won the Australian Open in January. Wozniacki's opponent, Anna Chakvetadze, was unable to continue the match after suffering from nausea and dizziness on court. The Russian player has a history of health issues, having battled with both physical and mental problems in recent years. After the incident, Chakvetadze was treated by medical staff and reported to be recovering well. Meanwhile, Andy Murray has withdrawn from the next week's ATP event, also being held in Dubai, due to injury. The British player has been struggling with a hip injury for several months and had already withdrawn from the Brisbane International in January. Murray had hoped to return to action in Dubai but has suffered a setback in his recovery. Murray's withdrawal comes at a time when many of the top players in the world are struggling with injuries. Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, and Stan Wawrinka are also among the players who are currently sidelined due to injury, causing concern among fans and officials alike. Despite the injury problems affecting many players, the Dubai Tennis Championships are still attracting some of the world's top tennis players. Among the players who have already advanced to the last 16 are defending champion Elina Svitolina, current world number two Garbine Muguruza, and rising star Daria Kasatkina. With much of the focus currently on the health of the players, tennis fans will be eager to see how the Dubai Tennis Championships will continue. Caroline Wozniacki's journey towards reclaiming the world number one ranking will undoubtedly be a key point of interest as the tournament progresses, particularly if she can maintain her impressive form.
