Humpbacks are often seen in Monterey Bay in the late Summer months, where gray whales can also be found. The humpbacks live in the bay between April and December, feeding on schooling fishes and krill. They often use a 'bubble net' to catch their prey, blowing bubbles that surround the school so it cannot escape before swooping through with their mouths wide open. Killer whales often lurk just outside of the bay, hoping to catch the gray whales when they migrate north. The acrobatic humpbacks can grow up to 50ft long, and have a reputation for throwing themselves out of the water despite weighing up to 40 tons. They were almost hunted to extinction during the 1960s, but a ban has allowed their global population to reach approximately 80,000. The whales are also known for the songs they sing when looking for a mate, which can last for up to 20 minutes and can be heard 18 miles away.
