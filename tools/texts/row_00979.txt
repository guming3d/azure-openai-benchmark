article: (CNN) -- As a teenager who basically lives at Disney World, Lily Mock has been on virtually every ride at the Florida amusement park. But no ride has been as surprising as the monorail from Magic Kingdom to Epcot center. A power outage Sunday evening forced the evacuation of about 120 passengers from the monorail, Disney spokeswoman Jacquee Wahler said. She said weather caused the power outage, but it did not appear a lightning strike was responsible. Lily said the sky was filled with dark clouds when she, her parents and siblings boarded the monorail around 6 p.m. "When we sat there, we heard a lot of thunder and saw a few bolts of lightning," the 15-year-old said. Suddenly, with the monorail about 30 feet in the air, the train came to a halt. "It wasn't a jolting stop, but it did stop really fast -- the monorail glided to a stop," Lily said. Without the air conditioner running, the train car got pretty hot over the next 90 minutes. As they waited for firefighters to help them off, the stranded visitors passed the time by chatting with each other and messaging friends. No one seemed to panic, Lily said. Firefighters later managed to pop open the top hatch of the train car -- but opted to escort passengers out through the doors, using a lift. That actually disappointed Lily. "I kind of wanted to go through the top, I thought it'd be fun," she said. Despite the mishap, Lily said she'll definitely be back -- especially after getting free passes for the inconvenience. And for a teen who visits Disney World at least three times a year, the experience was actually pretty cool. "I just kept saying this is the most exclusive ride, having to evacuate the monorail," Lily said. Her mother, Melissa Mock, has been visiting Disney World since she was 8 years old. She describes the family as a bunch of "Disney-philes" and didn't mind the surprise at all. "It was the single most exciting thing that's happened to us since we've been visiting in 30 years," she said. Six Flags coaster car derails, 4 injured .

chatgpt: About 120 passengers were evacuated on the monorail heading to Epcot on Monday morning after being stuck on the train for about 90 minutes. According to a passenger, the incident occurred due to a mechanical issue in the monorail system. Passengers on board the train were left stranded for about an hour-and-a-half as rescue personnel worked to evacuate them from the train. Despite the long wait time, many passengers reportedly remained in high spirits throughout the ordeal. "It was the single most exciting thing that's happened to us here," one guest said, according to reports. Disney World officials confirmed that there was a mechanical issue with the monorail, which prompted them to evacuate the train safely. They added that they had also taken the necessary steps to ensure that all guests who were affected by the incident were taken care of. No injuries were reported as a result of the incident, and all passengers on the affected train were safely evacuated to a nearby station where they were given refreshments while they waited for further instruction. It's not the first time that such an incident has occurred at Disney World, as the monorail system has faced technical difficulties in the past. But despite this, many guests remain loyal to the iconic Disney attraction, which offers a unique and unforgettable experience for tourists visiting the park. The monorail is a popular mode of transportation at Disney World, as it offers guests a scenic view of the park while also providing an efficient way to move between attractions. With its colourful vintage-style trains, the monorail is a Disney World icon that has been in operation since the early days of the park. For many visitors to the park, the monorail is a highlight of their visit, providing them with an experience that is both magical and memorable. And while incidents like the one that occurred on Monday morning can be stressful and nerve-wracking for guests, they also serve as a testament to Disney's commitment to safety and guest satisfaction. Disney officials say they will investigate the incident to determine the cause of the mechanical issue and ensure that steps are taken to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. For now, visitors to the park are advised to continue enjoying all that Disney World has to offer, including the beloved monorail.
