article: Arsenal's chances of landing Lucas Silva in January could be resurrected after Carlo Ancelotti admitted Real Madrid had still not decided if they should meet Cruzeiro's asking price or not. The 21-year-old favours a move to the Spanish capital but his club want a quick sale and if Arsenal are willing to meet the £12million valuation when the winter transfer window opens they favour sending him to London. Ahead of Real Madrid's Friday night game against Almeria before they fly to Morocco for the World Club Championship Ancelotti was asked about the possibility of signing Silva in January and said: 'We are waiting to see how the recovery of Modric and James [Rodriguez] progresses.' Real Madrid are unsure whether they are willing to pay Cruzeiro's asking price for Lucas Silva . Arsene Wenger is keen on bringing the 21-year-old midfielder to the Emirates Stadium . The former has a thigh injury and is not expected to be back before March and Rodriguez has a calf problem but may still return for the final of the World Club Championship if Madrid reach it. 'We will not decide anything until the new year,' said Ancelotti. Silva is part-owned by a sports investment fund who would be owed around £4m from any £12m sale. Cruzeiro officials are expected to hold talks with Madrid officials in the next couple of days in Belo Horizonte and if the Spanish club fail to meet the asking price Arsenal will be favourites for his signature. Cruzeiro have just won the league in Brazil and Silva's consistent displays throughout the season were important in that success. He was named in the league's team of the season at the end of the campaign. Carlo Ancelotti admitted Real Madrid had still not decided if they should meet Cruzeiro's £12million price .

chatgpt: Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti has made a surprising admission regarding midfielder Lucas Silva. The Brazilian, who joined the Spanish giants from Cruzeiro in January 2015, has struggled to establish himself in the team, making only nine appearances in La Liga. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Ancelotti revealed that the club had not yet made a decision on Silva's future. "At the moment, we haven't decided what is going to happen with Lucas Silva," he said. "We'll make a decision when the time comes." Silva has been linked with a move away from the Santiago Bernabeu all summer, with Arsenal reportedly showing interest in his services. The Gunners are keen to add depth to their midfield, and the 22-year-old's technical ability and passing range would be a valuable addition to the squad. However, a major obstacle in the move could be Cruzeiro's asking price for the player. The Brazilian club is said to be demanding around £12million for Silva, a price that may deter Arsenal from making a formal bid. Despite this, the North London outfit remain keen on the midfielder, and manager Arsene Wenger has reportedly instructed his scouting team to continue monitoring the situation. If a deal can be struck at a more reasonable price, Silva could become Arsenal's sixth signing of the summer, following the arrivals of Petr Cech, Jeff Reine-Adelaide, Yassin Fortune, Vlad Dragomir, and Jordi Osei-Tutu. Silva's potential arrival at the Emirates Stadium would provide Wenger with another option in central midfield, where he already boasts the likes of Francis Coquelin, Santi Cazorla, Jack Wilshere, and Aaron Ramsey. The Brazilian's versatility could also allow him to play deeper in a holding role or further forward as an attacking midfielder. As the transfer window enters its final weeks, it remains to be seen whether Arsenal will make a move for Silva, and whether they will meet Cruzeiro's asking price. But with Wenger keen to strengthen his squad ahead of a challenging Premier League campaign, the Gunners could yet make another high-profile signing.
