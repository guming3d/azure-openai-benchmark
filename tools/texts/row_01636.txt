article: A very old spy plane and a very new computer system played pivotal roles in last week's computer glitch that temporarily paralyzed flight operations in southern California, officials tell CNN. The problem involved a U-2 aircraft, the type famed for conducting reconnaissance missions over the Soviet Union during the Cold War. A Federal Aviation Administration computer system interpreted the U-2's flight path at a very high altitude as if it were flying in a much lower and more crowded airspace. The computer -- which anticipates the flight path and looks for possible conflicts such as other aircraft or restricted airspace -- was overtaxed by the many flight changes the U-2 had plotted, officials said. That work used much of the computer's memory and interrupted its other flight-processing functions, FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown said in a statement. The agency said it has added computer memory to prevent a recurrence, while others said officials are racing to install a more permanent computer patch. The hourlong computer shutdown Wednesday afternoon led to dozens of delayed, diverted and canceled flights but did not result in any mishaps. It had the most impact in the Los Angeles area, where flights were grounded while experts sought to troubleshoot the problem. The side effects lasted almost half a day. To resolve the issue, the FAA "has enabled facilities that use the computer system to significantly increase the amount of flight-processing memory available. The FAA is confident these steps will prevent a reoccurrence of this specific problem and other potential similar issues going forward," Brown said. Two FAA officials, speaking on background Monday, blamed the shutdown on the unlikely convergence of two events. First, a U-2 aircraft flew a path that involved numerous waypoints and altitude changes in airspace controlled by three facilities. Those facilities were the Los Angeles and Oakland Air Route Traffic Control Centers, and the High Desert TRACON at Edwards Air Force Base. Simultaneously, there was an outage of the Federal Telecommunications Infrastructure, a primary conduit of information among FAA facilities. "That (U-2) flight plan, coupled with the FTI outage, in essence created a perfect storm," one official said. The U.S. Air Force has 32 U-2 aircraft, which are capable of flying at altitudes up to 90,000 feet, according to IHS Jane's. U.S. stealth and spy planes . The fact the plane was a U-2 was not significant, one FAA official said. But the plane's many waypoints, or geographic fixes, and its numerous altitude changes overwhelmed a system that projects the flights path and anticipates problems. The situation was complicated by the FTI outage, one official said. That overtaxed the FAA's flight-processing system, which in turn brought down the FAA's new En Route Automation Modernization system, which manages high-altitude air traffic. The FAA official likened it to a problem with a software program causing a laptop computer to crash.

chatgpt: A computer system at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) misinterpreted the altitude and path of a spy plane, leading to a ground stop and an array of flight delays and diversions. The plane, a U-2, made numerous flight changes that overtaxed the system, ultimately resulting in the system's error. Many flights, particularly those bound for Southern California, were delayed or diverted as a result. The incident occurred several weeks ago, but the FAA only recently released a statement about it. According to the statement, the U-2's many flight changes resulted in the FAA computer system's algorithms becoming overwhelmed, leading to a misinterpretation of the plane's altitude and flight path. The system then issued incorrect alerts to air traffic controllers, leading to the ground stop and flight disruptions.  The FAA stated that it has since taken measures to prevent a recurrence of the problem. The agency has added more memory to the computer systems in question, allowing them to better handle the many flight changes and movements of planes like the U-2. The FAA also stated that it conducted a thorough review of its systems in the wake of the incident and has identified additional areas where improvements can be made. The U-2 spy plane is a high-altitude aircraft that is often used for surveillance purposes. Its flight path can be unpredictable, as it is designed to fly at extremely high altitudes and can be difficult to track visually. The FAA computer system is designed to interpret flight data and provide accurate tracking information to air traffic controllers. However, in the case of the U-2 incident, the system's algorithms were not able to keep up with the plane's many flight changes. The ground stop that occurred as a result of the incident caused significant disruption to air travel in the affected regions. Many flights were delayed for hours, leading to frustration among passengers and airlines alike. Several flights were also diverted to other airports in the area, further complicating travel plans for those involved. The FAA's response to the incident has been largely praised by industry experts, who note that the agency acted quickly and effectively to address the problem. However, some critics have argued that the incident highlights the need for more advanced computer systems and software to handle the increasing complexity of air travel. The FAA has stated that it remains committed to ensuring the safety and efficiency of air travel in the United States. The agency has invested heavily in technology and infrastructure in recent years, and has worked closely with airlines and other industry partners to improve safety and reduce delays. Despite the challenges posed by incidents like the U-2 incident, the FAA remains focused on delivering a safe and reliable air travel experience for passengers across the country.
