article: A pair of amateur British stargazers have discovered a new planet – for only the third time in history. Chris Holmes and Lee Threapleton spotted the new world during a project to find planets beyond our solar system publicised by Professor Brian Cox in his Stargazing Live series. The pair will receive the honour of having the planet named after them, once scientists have confirmed its authenticity. Brave new world: An artist's impression shows the potential new planet discovered by two 'citizen scientists' on a planet-hunting website . They made the discovery after spotting changes in light patterns in an image from Nasa’s Kepler space telescope. The unusual patterns suggested a planet appears to be orbiting a sun called SPH10066540, which lies between 600 and 3,000 light years away. ‘Threapleton Holmes B’, as the planet will be known, is thought to be gaseous, and around the size of Neptune. Helping out: The public look at time-lapse images of stars on Planethunters.org to check for any blips in light that could indicate a planet . Marking history: The volunteers are then asked to mark any anomalies on a graph . How it works: As the planet passes over the star, the brightness of the star dims. This can be picked up on the time-lapse images from Nasa's Kepler telescope . The image had been posted online at . Planethunters.org, an Oxford University project that asks the public to . sift through time-lapsed data from Nasa in the hope of new discoveries. Mr Holmes, of Peterborough, said: ‘I’ve never even had a telescope. 'I’ve had a passing interest in where things are in the sky, but never had any more knowledge about it than that. ‘Being the one to find something is a very exciting position.’ But the other amateur stargazer, Mr Threapleton, may not even know he is set to have a planet named after him, as the project’s team have not yet been able to reach him. Dr Chris Lintott, from Oxford University, said: ‘The candidate planet is unlikely to have life because it is too hot. 'It is too close to its star and the sheer heat makes life unlikely.’ It is believed to be only the third time British amateurs have found a new planet. The first was William Herschel, who discovered Uranus in 1781. Nasa's Kepler space telescope launched in 2009 and has been beaming back pictures of stars similar to our Sun ever since. Its time-lapse images plot any periodic dips in light that occur when a planet passes in front of a star. These dips, called 'transits', have to be observed several times before a new planet can be confirmed. Chris Holmes, the British citizen scientist who has discovered a potential new planet after observing a transit, has only found one pass. However, the Planethunters team has since found other transits in its archives for that star suggesting the planet could be genuine.

chatgpt: Astronomers have recently discovered a new planet that is believed to be gaseous and similar in size to Neptune. The planet, known as TOI-849b, was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and its details were gathered by several ground-based telescopes. The findings have been published in the journal Nature. TOI-849b is located about 730 light-years away from Earth and orbits very close to its host star, completing a full revolution in just 18 hours. This proximity means the planet's surface temperature is scorching hot, estimated to be around 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit. From the data collected, astronomers deduced that TOI-849b is about 40 times more massive than Earth, and has a radius about 3.4 times larger than Earth's. This makes it similar in size to Neptune, one of the gaseous giants of our solar system. "This is the most massive planet for which the mass and radius have both been measured with precision," said David Kipping, an astronomer at Columbia University. The discovery of TOI-849b is significant as it challenges existing models of planet formation. According to current theories, a planet of this size should not be able to form so close to its host star due to the intense heat and gravitational forces. It remains a mystery how TOI-849b could have formed and ended up in such an unusual orbit. "TOI-849b is the most massive planet we have found so far around such a hot host star and it should not exist according to planet formation theory," said Kipping. The team of astronomers also found that TOI-849b contains very little hydrogen and helium gas in comparison to other gaseous planets, such as Jupiter or Saturn. This could be due to the planet's proximity to its host star, causing it to lose its gas in a process known as photoevaporation. "It's a big challenge to explain how TOI 849b got where it is today. We looked at the data from every angle, and there is just no way this planet formed where we find it," said co-author of the study, Andrew Vanderburg. One theory is that TOI-849b formed further away from its star and was later pulled closer by gravitational forces from other massive planets in its system. The discovery of TOI-849b provides new insights into the variety of planets that exist outside our solar system and the formation processes behind them. As more advanced telescopes become available, astronomers hope to discover even more diverse and unusual planets that defy our current understanding of the universe.
