Today, the century-old building still remains a historic landmark, attracting numerous visitors from all around the globe. Recently, the building has become a hot topic in the real estate market due to its extremely cheap price tag. The current owners have decided to sell the property for a fraction of its actual value due to the high vacancy rates in the area.
