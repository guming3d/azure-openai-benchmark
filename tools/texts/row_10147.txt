article: WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Supreme Court has blocked the imminent release of dozens of sex offenders who have served their federal sentences after the Obama administration claimed many of them remain "sexually dangerous." The Supreme Court has blocked the release of sex offenders  after claims they remain dangerous. Chief Justice John Roberts on Friday ordered that the men be kept in custody while the case works its way through a federal appeals court, which had ruled as many as 77 North Carolina inmates should be released, some as early as next week. At issue is whether the government has the power to indefinitely detain prisoners who have served their sentences but could pose a public threat upon release. Such laws are known as "civil commitments." The Justice Department filed papers with the high court Friday, asking that any release be put on hold until the justices have more time to consider the larger legal issues raised in their appeal. Such an early release "would pose a significant risk to the public and constitute a significant harm to the interest of the United States," wrote Solicitor General Elena Kagan, who took office this month. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act passed by Congress in 2006 included a provision allowing indefinite confinement of sex offenders. A federal appeals court in Richmond, Virginia, ruled lawmakers had overstepped their authority, prompting the emergency appeal to the Supreme Court. The law was named after the son of "America's Most Wanted" host John Walsh. The boy was kidnapped and murdered by a suspected child molester in 1981. Four inmates brought suit against the law. They were serving sentences of up to eight years for sexual abuse of a minor or possessing child pornography. Their detention was to have ended two years ago, but corrections officials and prosecutors determined they remained a risk for further sexually deviant behavior if freed. The inmates argued such continued imprisonment violates their constitutional right of due process. The justices' actions means the men remain behind bars for now. The case is U.S. v. Comstock (08A863).

chatgpt: As many as 77 inmates in North Carolina have been scheduled to be released, but the Obama administration is claiming that many of them are "sexually dangerous". This has caused concerns among officials in the state, who are now grappling with the possibility of keeping the men incarcerated. The inmates were originally set to be released because their sentences had already been completed or because they had been granted parole. However, concerns began mounting when the Obama administration intervened and notified North Carolina officials that many of the men were sexually dangerous and should not be released. As a result of this intervention, the men's release has been put on hold for now. According to the Obama administration, the inmates are in need of further evaluation before they can be released back into society. Officials in North Carolina have acknowledged the concerns raised by the Obama administration and have pledged to work with federal officials to ensure that the release of the inmates does not pose a threat to society. They have stated that they will provide additional resources to evaluate the inmates in question and to make sure they receive the necessary treatments if deemed appropriate. The issue of releasing potentially sexually dangerous inmates is not new. In recent years, states across the country have been grappling with similar concerns, particularly in light of high-profile cases where individuals have committed heinous crimes after being released from jail. Despite the concerns raised by the Obama administration, families of the inmates have pleaded with officials to release their loved ones. They argue that many of the men have already served their time and should be allowed to return to their families and communities. They also argue that the classification of sexually dangerous should not be used to indefinitely incarcerate individuals who have already completed their sentences. For now, the fate of these 77 North Carolina inmates remains uncertain. While officials have acknowledged the concerns raised by the Obama administration, they are also mindful of the need to respect the rights of the inmates and their families. Ultimately, this is a difficult and complex issue that requires careful consideration and meaningful dialogue between officials and concerned stakeholders.
