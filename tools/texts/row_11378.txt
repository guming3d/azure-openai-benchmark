More than a million would-be festivalgoers got up early in a bid to secure a spot at the legendary event. They descended on official booking website seetickets.com at 9am in the hope of buying one of the £210 tickets. However, fans were forced to wait half an hour after site crashed due to overwhelming demand. Delighted: Organiser Emily Eavis and her father Michael said they had been 'blown away' by the overwhelming demand for tickets . By 10am, a whopping 80,000 tickets had already been bought and less than half an hour later, organiser Emily Eavis announced the remainder had gone. She tweeted: 'We have sold out in record time. Thanks to everyone for all your efforts and patience and we are very sorry to those of you who missed out.' In a joint statement with her father Michael Eavis, she said the pair had been 'blown away' by the size of demand. It read: 'We are sorry that many of you missed out on a ticket. We genuinely try to make the ticket system as fair as it can be, but when demand outstrips supply, it is an unfortunate inevitability thatsome people will be left disappointed.' An allocation of early-bird tickets - offered to selected fans - went on sale on Thursday and were snapped up within 30 minutes. Earlier this year, Mr Eavis said 2014's headliners - who have never played Glastonbury before - had already been booked, but refused to reveal who they were. Fleetwood Mac, Prince, David Bowie and even Oasis - who have not played together since a bitter split in 2009 - have all been tipped to appear. This year's bash at Worthy Farm, Pilton, Somerset, saw the Rolling Stones headline the famous Pyramid Stage to rave reviews.

chatgpt: Glastonbury Festival has proven once again why it is one of the most popular music events in the world after all 120,000 tickets for the 2020 edition sold out in a record-breaking 87 minutes. However, the surge in demand proved overwhelming for the official booking site which crashed, leaving many disappointed fans unable to purchase tickets.  Organiser Emily Eavis expressed her apologies to those who were unable to get their hands on a ticket, tweeting, "We have now sold out. Thank you all for your incredible, continued support. Demand was higher than ever, with over 2.4 million registered. Bring on 2020!"  The festival, which has been running since the 1970s, is one of the biggest annual music events in the world, attracting tens of thousands of music lovers from across the globe to a small farm in Somerset, England, each year.  This year's festival saw headline performances from The Killers, The Cure, and Stormzy. While next year's lineup is yet to be announced, rumours are already circulating that Sir Paul McCartney, Taylor Swift, and Kendrick Lamar could be some of the big names to take to the iconic Pyramid Stage.  Glastonbury Festival has a long-standing tradition of offering a diverse lineup, featuring artists from various genres, as well as providing a platform for up-and-coming artists. The festival has also been a hub for activism and social change, with various movements and charities having a presence in the festival's "Green Fields".  The festival's founder, Michael Eavis, has previously spoken about the importance of activism and social awareness in music, saying, "The festival is a political place, and we have a good record of being politically sound, putting great messages across."  Aside from the music, the festival also features a wide range of other activities, such as circus performances, poetry readings, and wellness workshops. It has become more than just a music festival, but a cultural phenomenon that attracts people from all walks of life.  The overwhelming demand for tickets this year demonstrates the enduring appeal of Glastonbury Festival, despite the challenges it has faced over the years, such as mud-filled fields and logistical issues. The festival has managed to retain its unique charm, with generations of music lovers continuing to flock to the small farm in Somerset year after year.  For those who missed out on tickets this year, the official Glastonbury Festival website advised keeping an eye out for any potential resale opportunities in the spring, although the demand is likely to be just as high then. The 2020 edition of Glastonbury Festival takes place on June 24-28, and is sure to be a magical experience for all those lucky enough to secure a ticket.
