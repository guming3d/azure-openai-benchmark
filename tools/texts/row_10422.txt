article: Sergio Aguero was lucky to stay on the pitch against West Ham on Saturday during a game in which Sam Allardyce's side marshalled the Manchester City striker with relative ease. West Ham duo Winston Reid and James Collins were able to deal with everything that was thrown at them - with Aguero forced into feeding off scraps during the Premier League encounter. And the Argentina international should have been sent for an early bath for a studs-up challenge on Mark Noble.

Aguero looked lively during the opening minutes as the 26-year-old tried to test Hammers stopper Adrian. His effort flashed just wide of the goal but his attempt sent a warning to West Ham's defence - Â they had to keep a close eye on the Premier League's joint-leading scorer. West Ham's rearguard were forced into stopping Aguero's typically mazy runs on two occasions by simply hacking the striker down on the edge of the box. Yaya Toure was handed the responsibility of taking the subsequent free-kicks but his attempts did not trouble Adrian. His link-up play with David Silva was particularly impressive but he was not allowed the time and space to test West Ham's Spanish keeper. Aguero, who cut a frustrated figure during the first half, should not have even appeared back on the Upton Park turf after the interval as the former Atletico Madrid man swiped at the legs of Noble on the stroke of half-time. Manuel Pellegrini brought on Stevan Jovetic for Edin Dzeko to try to get the best out of his star forward and the substitution seemed to have an immediate effect on City's forward play. Aguero had the perfect opportunity to put City on level terms in the 65th minute when he was played in by Jesus Navas but his shot from close range smashed against the bar. Silva stepped up to the plate after West Ham had doubled their advantage by twisting and turning inside the area before curling the ball past Adrian but the champions were unable to find the equaliser.

chatgpt: Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero failed to leave his mark on the field during the recent match against West Ham United at Upton Park. The Argentine forward was unable to connect with the ball in any meaningful way, and his lack of impact was felt throughout the game. Despite Aguero's lackluster performance, he nearly found himself in serious trouble after a dangerous challenge on Mark Noble. The tackle was incredibly reckless and deserved a red card, but the referee chose to only caution the City forward. Aguero's luck didn't improve much after that incident, as he was unable to capitalize on a golden opportunity to give his team the lead. The striker hit the woodwork from close range, much to the frustration of City fans. This disappointing result will only fuel the rumors that Aguero is on the decline. The former Premier League top scorer has struggled with injuries in recent seasons, and today's display will do little to quell concerns about his long-term form. While Aguero's lack of performance was a factor in City's inability to secure the win, it would be unfair to blame him entirely. The team as a whole was unable to create enough chances and didn't display their usual attacking prowess. Despite the disappointing result, City will need to quickly regroup ahead of their next match. The team is set to face a tough test against Leicester City, who are currently sitting third in the league table. Manager Pep Guardiola will need to make some tough decisions regarding his starting lineup, particularly regarding Aguero. While the Argentine is still a valuable asset to the team, his current form is cause for concern. With City currently sitting in fourth place and struggling to keep pace with the league leaders, it is imperative that Guardiola finds a winning formula soon. The team has the talent and potential to compete at the highest level, but they will need to start putting together consistent performances if they hope to challenge for the title. In the meantime, City fans will be left wondering what could have been if Aguero had been able to convert his chances at Upton Park. The striker will need to find his form quickly if he hopes to keep his spot in the team and help lead City to victory in the upcoming matches.
