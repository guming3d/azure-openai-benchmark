article: Atlanta (CNN) -- Defendants with limited English-language skills have a constitutional right to court interpreters in criminal trials, the Supreme Court of Georgia ruled Monday. The ruling came in a case involving a Mandarin Chinese speaker who was sentenced to 10 years in prison on two counts of cruelty to a child. Annie Ling, who had limited English language skills, did not understand that she had the option to plead guilty instead of going to trial and possibly facing a longer sentence, said the American Civil Liberties Union, one of two groups that filed a friend-of-the-court brief stating that denying a defendant an interpreter violates the U.S. Constitution and civil rights laws. "The court acknowledged that we don't have two systems of justice in this country -- one for English speakers and another for everyone else," said Azadeh Shahshahani, director of the National Security/Immigrants' Rights Project at the ACLU of Georgia. "The constitutional guarantee of due process applies to everyone in this country, not just fluent English speakers." Ling was arrested and charged with two counts of cruelty to a child. Her children were removed from the home and placed in foster care, according to court documents. After a 2008 trial, Ling was convicted of one count of cruelty to a child, and sentenced to 15 years, with 10 to serve in prison. The conviction was appealed to the Georgia Supreme Court. The court agreed with the brief, in which the Legal Aid Society-Employment Law Center joined with the ACLU, that the Sixth Amendment and the due process clause of the 14th Amendment guarantee the defendant the right to an interpreter. The Georgia Supreme Court also instructed all Georgia state courts to practice "vigilance in protecting the rights of non-English-speakers."

chatgpt: A woman who was sentenced to 10 years in a 2008 case is claiming that she did not understand the options that were available to her. The defendant, whose name has not been released, is arguing that her lack of understanding violated her constitutional rights. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) believes that the case highlights a larger issue in the criminal justice system. According to the defendant's attorney, her client did not receive adequate legal counsel during the case. She claims that the defendant was not informed of the options available to her and did not fully understand the consequences of her actions. The defendant pleaded guilty to the charges against her, but her attorney argues that she would have made a different decision if she had been properly informed. The case has drawn the attention of the ACLU and other civil rights organizations, who believe that the defendant's rights were violated. They argue that everyone has the right to be fully informed about their legal options and to receive adequate legal representation, regardless of their socio-economic background. The ACLU is calling for an investigation into the case and for reforms to be made to the criminal justice system. Despite the arguments made by the defendant and the ACLU, the courts have not responded to the case. The woman remains in prison, serving her 10-year sentence. It is unclear if her claims will be heard in court or if the case will be reopened. The case highlights the importance of ensuring that everyone has access to legal representation and receives proper counsel. The criminal justice system relies on the assumption that individuals understand their rights and the options available to them. When this assumption is challenged, it can have serious consequences for those involved in the case. The hope is that this case and others like it will lead to positive reforms and changes in the legal system to ensure that everyone is treated fairly and justly.
