article: A 35-year-old man was shot and killed by authorities in Northern California after he struck a police dog with a claw hammer and then swung it at an officer. Police were responding to a family disturbance call that an intoxicated man was destroying the residence with a hammer when they found Matautu Nuu outside wielding the tool. After Nuu refused officers requests to drop the weapon, shouting 'shoot me, shoot me', they deployed a Stockton police K9 named Nitro to take him down. Nuu then struck the canine's nose and cut him on the snout, said police spokesman Joe Silva. Matautu Nu, 35, was shot by two Stockton police officers after hitting police K9 dog Nitro (pictured) on the nose with a hammer . Officers John Griffin and Jason Schaffer fired their tasers at Nuu but it had no effect, Mr Silva told News10 ABC. Nuu was about to strike Nitro's handler, who had rushed in to save the dog, when the officers shot him down. First aid was immediately administered on the scene before Nuu was taken to a hospital where he later died of his wounds, Mr Silva said. The three-year-old Dutch Shepherd was taken to an emergency veterinarian and has been reunited with his owner. Nuu's family witnessed the incident and said the shooting was unnecessary, they told Fox40. They said the outcome would have been different if the police had let them talk to Nuu. 'What do we do right now? We lost a loved one, you know?' Karisamasi Nuu, Matautu's sister, said. She said Nuu's brother wanted to speak to him because 'he's the only one who could calm him down,' but the officers refused. 'Why did they not give us that choice?' she asked. As Nuu was about to strike the dog's handlers the officers shot him down outside his family's home on Martinique Court in Stockton, California (pictured) One  witness who asked to remain unidentified told Fox40 the family was screaming at police that 'he just has a hammer' and was begging Nuu to put the tool down. Mr Silva described the incident as dangerous because Nuu was 'vandalizing a house, which actually elevates the danger even a little bit more for people inside the residence'. He said things turned 'real violent' after Nuu attacked Nitro and 'got ready to attack' his handler. The officers have been placed on three-day administrative leave and there will be a multiagency investigation of the incident. Mr Silva said both actions are standard procedure for any shooting that involves officers. Nuu had been arrested twice for public intoxication in 2014, as well as for battery on an officer and resisting arrest in 2008. This week protesters called for the resignation of the chief of the Stockton Police Department after a number of recent officer-involved shootings.
