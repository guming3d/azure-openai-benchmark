article: It could be the ultimate ocean going retreat - with a 'party deck' hull specially designed to keep your martini safe at all times. Rather than a sleek yacht, Lockheed Martin is hoping someone will instead prefer an experimental navy vessel built to endure travel through rough seas at high speed. The experimental boat can remain stable and travel at high speeds in waves upto twelve feet high - although its triple deck bunk beds do leave it in need of a little interior design. Scroll down for video . The ship has an advanced hull designed for outstanding stability and speed in high sea states and is capable of 30-plus knots in wave heights of up to 12 feet. The ultimate party deck? The boat has a large rear desk which remains stable even in 12 foot waves . The 105-ft (32-m) long, 55-ft (17-m) wide, 180-ton (163-tonne) watercraft features two 3,480 hp diesel engines, two 180-kW Caterpillar diesel electric generators, and  a top speed of 30 knots (56 km/h, or 35 mph). It is now on sale for $180,000 online, and is currently in San Diego. The pictures of it show six bunks and a rather minimalist kitchen, so it could be described as needing work. It also has a shower-equipped bathroom, plus a washer and dryer. The ship has an advanced hull that provides for outstanding stability and speed in high sea states and is capable of 30-plus knots in wave heights of up to 12 feet. 'Sea SLICE, designated as a High Speed Vessel (HSV) for the exercise, is demonstrating the flexibility achievable by 'modularity' in a small, fast, highly maneuverable platform,' the Navy wrote when it first trialled the ship. The unique design has a large rear desk - perfect for parties . Buyers may want to redecorate the craft, which comes with three tier bunkbeds and a rather minimalist kitchen area . 'The joint high speed vessel (experimental) Joint Venture (HSV-X1) has been evaluating the potential of fast, shallow draft, open architecture, multi-mission vessels with large payload fractions in the areas of mine warfare, special operations, ship-to-objective maneuver and medical and non-combatant support operations.' Some of its weapons tested during FBE-J include the joint Lockheed Martin and Oerlikon Contraves 35mm Millennium Gun and the NetFires System and launcher, intended to launch Loitering Attack Munitions (LAM) - although these have now been removed.

chatgpt: The United States Navy has partnered with a craft builder to create a unique vessel that can travel at high speeds in rough seas. The craft boasts a distinctive design featuring four hulls that work to keep the craft stable in even the roughest conditions, including waves up to 12 feet high. This vessel has been used in several military exercises as a support ship, and the unique hull design has been touted as a game-changer for naval operations in rough seas. The craft was put through its paces during these exercises and passed with flying colors, proving its ability to navigate even the toughest of conditions with ease. One of the key features of the vessel is its speed. When compared to other vessels in its class, this craft has been shown to be significantly faster, allowing it to outrun almost any threat it may face on the high seas. This feature is particularly important when it comes to military operations, where speed can often be the difference between success and failure. Another important aspect of the vessel's design is the added stability it provides. With four hulls instead of the traditional one or two, the craft is able to remain more stable even in the roughest of seas. This added stability can help to keep crew members safe and prevent damage to the vessel itself, which is crucial in any military operation. The craft's unique design has generated a lot of interest outside of military circles as well. Many experts in the field of naval engineering see the vessel as a potential game-changer for the commercial shipping industry, particularly in areas where rough seas are common. The added stability and speed could help to reduce costs and improve safety for cargo vessels travelling in difficult conditions. Overall, the unique design of this vessel has proven to be a major success in the military sphere, with the craft being used in several high-profile operations. And while the benefits of the craft's design are not limited to military operations alone, there is no doubt that this vessel represents a significant advancement in naval technology, and a potential game-changer in the world of high-speed, high-stability sea travel.
