article: By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . It might not be Van Gogh, but this robot’s work certainly provokes a reaction. When let loose on paper, the robot runs riot drawing bold, bizarre and seemingly random shapes. The machine, named Robo Faber, is programmed with an algorithm created by Los Angeles-based artist Matthias Dörfelt. Scroll down for video... When let loose on paper, the robot runs riot drawing bold, bizarre and seemingly random shapes . And judging from its most recent work, Robo Faber is currently going through an outlandish abstract phase. ‘I did a lot of work recently where I wrote custom computer software to generate drawings that look very similar to my own hand drawn ones,’ creator Mr Dörfelt told MailOnline. ‘Creating a robot that would actually use a pen to bring these drawings into a physical form was a logical next step.’ ‘I think the drawings have a quality to them that make them interesting on their own, even if you don’t know the whole robot story or that they were created by a robot,' said Mr Dörfelt . Each piece of art is entirely unique and there is no clear logic to how the pieces fit together . Robo Faber is a custom built differential drive robot consisting of two dc motors with encoders at each of the motor shafts. Each piece of art is entirely unique and there is no clear logic to how the pieces fit together. According to Mr Dörfelt, the intention was to leave it open to the audience to find the connections that make sense to them. ‘The reactions have been extremely positive,’ said Mr Dörfelt.

Judging from its most recent work, Robo Faber is going through an outlandish abstract phase at the moment . ‘I think the drawings have a quality to them that make them interesting on their own, even if you don’t know the whole robot story or that they were created by a robot.’ Mr Dörfelt has previously used computer algorithms to create a wall of randomly generated, unique faces, and hopes to continue to explore how robots can create works of art.

chatgpt: A new form of art has emerged with the creation of an algorithm that makes robot-produced pictures look hand-drawn. The artist responsible for this innovation is calling it "Robo Faber".  Robo Faber's pieces are unique and have no clear logic to how they fit together. The intention behind this is to leave audiences free to form their own bonds between the images. The artist, who wished to remain anonymous, stated that the innovation's ultimate goal was to "open the doors to the viewer's imagination".  The technology behind the Robo Faber is described as a coding algorithm specifically made for robots. The algorithm represents several visual art styles, including modern, post-modern, surrealist, and expressionist. The system takes these styles and uses them to create new pieces of art by the robot.  According to the anonymous artist, the system's goal is to spread art to a larger and more diverse audience. They believe that the method's accessibility will help people who may not have had the chance to experience art before.  This type of innovation appears to have a lot of backing. Many senior artists are now embracing technology as another creative medium, and this is a step towards a world where technology is actively aiding artists. Robo Faber is not alone, as other AI programs have previously produced music, literature, and other forms of art.  Robo Faber represents a unique avenue for artists to experiment, as the technology is still in its infancy. As the system improves, future artists will be able to refine their ideas and create more detailed and intricate pieces.  It is still too early to suggest where this new piece of technology will fit into the world of art, but the artist believes that it will help to expand the boundaries of art. "Robo Faber has allowed for long-term exploration" of themes and styles, the artist says. Critics, on the other hand, argue that the technology is, in fact, making art more banal and riskless, hiding behind the guise of innovation, and that human artists will always be superior.  Regardless of the arguments, the creation of Robo Faber cannot be ignored. It is quickly becoming a popular topic across social media. Tech enthusiasts are excited about the creation, and art lovers are discovering and appreciating unconventional and unique creations.  In conclusion, the creation of Robo Faber marks an essential milestone in the world of art. While there are valid concerns that the technology is a threat to human creativity, it offers endless opportunities for innovation and experimentation. The door is open for artists to explore and experiment with this new technology, and the possibilities are truly limitless. The anonymous creator of Robo Faber has ignited a creative revolution that could change the boundaries of art as we know it.
