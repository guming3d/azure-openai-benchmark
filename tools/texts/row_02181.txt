She said: 'I've got to admit it is a bit disheartening to work really hard at university to get a 2:1 and then not be able to get a job at the end of it. 'But given the difficult economic climate I always knew I wouldn't just be able to walk into a job. 'It's been three months now since I graduated and I decided I've got to try and do something different to get myself noticed. 'I was thinking of inventive ways I could advertise myself and suddenly thought that having an advert in a black cab could really grab someone's attention. 'A lot of people travel in a London taxi every day, so I thought there's a real chance the advert would catch someone's eye - hopefully a potential employer. 'I've got a friend who drives a black cab in central London and he said he'd love to try and help me, so fortunately I didn't even pay for the ad.'

chatgpt: Emma Clifford, a recent graduate, has resorted to desperate measures to find a job. Despite graduating with a 2:1 degree in June, she has not been able to secure a single interview. The 21-year-old has applied for dozens of jobs to no avail. Now, she has taken out an advertisement in the back of a black cab, in the hopes that someone may take notice. Emma is not alone in her struggle to find work after graduation. According to recent statistics, nearly one-third of UK university graduates are in low-skilled jobs. This is a concerning trend, given the rising costs of higher education and the competitive job market. Emma's advertisement, which reads "Please hire me! I'm desperate", has garnered attention on social media. Many people have expressed sympathy for her situation and have shared her story in the hopes of helping her find work. Some have even reached out to offer her job opportunities or networking connections. Despite the outpouring of support, Emma's situation highlights a larger issue. Many graduates are struggling to find work in their desired field, often due to a lack of experience or connections. The pandemic has only exacerbated this issue, with many businesses having to cut back on hiring or close altogether. Experts suggest that graduates may need to be more proactive in their job search, such as networking on social media or reaching out to alumni from their university. They may also need to consider internships or entry-level positions to gain experience and build their resume. In Emma's case, her advertisement may be a bold move, but it shows her determination and willingness to take risks. She is not content to sit back and wait for a job to come her way, and her creativity may pay off in the end. Some critics have argued that Emma's decision to take out an advertisement in a black cab is a sign of the times, where desperation for work has reached new heights. Others have praised her for her ingenuity and bravery, suggesting that more graduates may need to take similar approaches to stand out in a crowded job market. For Emma, the hope is that her advertisement will lead to at least one job offer or interview. Even if it doesn't, she may have gained valuable exposure and contacts through her bold move. In the end, it may take more than a degree to secure a job in today's market, but with determination and creativity, it is possible to stand out and succeed.
