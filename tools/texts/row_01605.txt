article: It is likely that Jordan Henderson will captain Liverpool when Steven Gerrard leaves at the end of this season. A tunnel tear-up with Diego Costa has been advanced as evidence of his new-found steel. ‘If he becomes captain he will carry it with great honour,’ said Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers. He is certainly much improved, yet Henderson is sorely lacking a quality that can never be taken for granted. He has three goals this season. Gerrard, in his comparative dotage, has nine. Henderson has just 16 goals in his entire Liverpool career, dating back to 2011. In that same period, Gerrard has 42.

Henderson captained Liverpool during the Reds' 0-0 draw with Bolton at Anfield in the FA Cup on Saturday . Henderson argued with Chelsea's Diego Costa at Anfield during Tuesday's Capital One Cup semi-final . Both are central midfielders, both regarded as leaders within the group. Yet time and again, Gerrard has used his position and influence to conjure a vital result for his club. Henderson is yet to prove he can do that. Saturday’s draw with Bolton Wanderers was another example. Gerrard was rested, Liverpool drew a blank. Nobody filled his shoes, certainly not Henderson. Let’s face it, Liverpool wouldn’t even have made it this far without Gerrard. Had Rodgers rested him against AFC Wimbledon, they would probably have fallen at the first. When Gerrard is on the pitch, one always feels Liverpool have a chance. Gerrard scored twice as Liverpool defeated Wimbledon in the third round of the FA Cup earlier this month . Anyone can have a row with Diego Costa. If we don’t hear about too many tunnel confrontations involving Gerrard it is probably because we are too busy celebrating his brilliance on the pitch, or one of his match-winning goals. Gerrard’s captaincy is about so much more than pulling on an armband. He leads by example, but also by deed.

chatgpt: Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson recently led his team to a 0-0 draw against Bolton during Saturday's Premier League clash. This is not the first time that the midfielder has been handed the captain's armband, with Henderson expected to take over from Steven Gerrard as Liverpool's captain next season. Henderson's leadership skills have been praised by his manager Brendan Rodgers, who has stated that the former Sunderland player has all the qualities necessary to become a great leader. The midfielder's hard work, passion for the game, and tactical awareness on the pitch has earned him the respect of his teammates and supporters alike. However, while Henderson's leadership skills may be admirable, there are still concerns over his ability to influence results like his predecessor, Steven Gerrard. Gerrard was famously known for his match-winning goals and decisive contributions on the pitch, and it remains to be seen whether Henderson can fill his shoes as Liverpool's talisman. At the moment, Henderson's performances have been solid but not exceptional. He has been a regular starter for Liverpool this season, making 27 appearances in the Premier League so far. However, he has only managed to score two goals and provide one assist, which is a low return for a player of his calibre. Henderson will need to step up his game if he wants to be considered a worthy successor to Gerrard. Liverpool fans will be looking for him to provide more creativity on the pitch, as well as more goals and assists. If he can improve in these areas and continue to lead by example, then there is no doubt that he will become a great captain for the club. In conclusion, Jordan Henderson captained Liverpool during their recent draw with Bolton, and is expected to take over from Steven Gerrard as the club's captain next season. Despite his leadership qualities, there are concerns over Henderson's ability to influence results like his predecessor. However, with hard work and determination, Henderson can prove his critics wrong and become a key player for Liverpool for many seasons to come.
