article: It may look rather more like a toy car than a hi-tech racing machine, but this mini-racer has become the world's fastest electric car. Called the Grimsel, and developed by Swiss researchers, it broke the previous world record for acceleration by going from 0 to 100 km/h in 1.785 seconds in under 30 metres. The carbon fibre construction has a total weight of 168 kg and produces about 200 hp (147 kW). Scroll down for video . The mini-motor went from from 0 to 100 km/h in 1.785 seconds in under 30 metres . Total weight of only 168kg . Powered by four AMZ M4 wheel hub motors. Produce 37kW each at a weight of 3.4kg. The planetary gearbox which is integrated into the upright transmits the torque to accumulated 1630Nm at the wheels. The chassis is a one piece carbon fibre monocoque . Aerodynamics package produces enough downforce to drive at the ceiling at 110km/h. Raced by the  the Formula Student team at the Academic Motorsports Club Zurich (AMZ), it beat the previous record of 2.134 seconds, which was held by an electric car built by Delft University of Technology. The new record was set at the military airfield in Dübendorf, where the vehicle reached a speed of 100 km per hour in less than 30 metres. The new record-breaking vehicle is a Formula Student electric car that was developed and built in less than a year by 30 students at ETH Zurich and Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts. The ‘grimsel’ is the fifth AMZ electric car and the result of continuous development. The carbon fibre construction has a total weight of 168 kg and produces about 200 hp (147 kW). A four-wheel drive is implemented with four specially designed wheel hub motors, which generate a total torque of 1630 Nm at the wheels. By means of traction control, torque distribution is controlled individually for each wheel to maximise vehicle acceleration. No other production vehicle in the world has reached a similarly strong acceleration. The new record was set at the military airfield in Dübendorf, where the vehicle reached a speed of 100 km per hour in less than 30 metres. The ‘grimsel’ celebrated numerous successes at the Formula Student international competition this summer. With more than 500 teams, Formula Student is the world’s biggest competition for engineers and is held annually at various locations around the globe. With three overall wins and an average of 920 points out of a possible 1,000, the ‘grimsel’ is AMZ’s most successful car. And with its victories in Austria and Spain, it achieved the two highest scores in the European history of Formula Student. These further strengthened AMZ’s standing at the top of the Formula Student world rankings and demonstrated the potential in electric drive concepts.

chatgpt: Swiss researchers have developed a new electric race car called Grimsel that is breaking records for speed and acceleration. The car recently went from 0 to 100 km/h in an astounding 1.785 seconds, all while covering less than 30 meters. This incredible achievement is the result of years of hard work and research by the team at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. The Grimsel combines cutting-edge technology with a lightweight design to create a car that is both fast and efficient. The car's electric powertrain is capable of producing an astonishing 2,000 Nm of torque, making it an incredibly powerful machine. The car is also incredibly light, weighing in at just 168 kg thanks to its carbon fiber construction. The Grimsel is not just an impressive feat of engineering, but also represents the potential of electric vehicles in the future of transportation. As the world becomes more focused on sustainable energy solutions, electric vehicles like the Grimsel are becoming more important than ever. The Grimsel's record-breaking performance is not the only impressive aspect of the car. It is also incredibly efficient, with a range of 22 miles on a single charge. This makes it an ideal vehicle for racing, as well as for everyday use. The Grimsel is just the latest in a long line of high-performance electric vehicles that are pushing the limits of what is possible. With advances in battery technology and electric powertrains, we are sure to see even more impressive vehicles in the years to come. Despite its impressive performance, the Grimsel is still a work in progress. The team at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich is continuing to refine the car's design and technology, with the goal of making it even faster and more efficient. The Grimsel is a testament to the power of innovation, and a reminder that electric vehicles are the future of transportation. As more and more people become aware of the benefits of electric vehicles, we are sure to see a shift toward more sustainable and efficient transportation solutions.
