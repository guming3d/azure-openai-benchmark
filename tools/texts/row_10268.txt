Burger King is jumping on the bacon bandwagon, and is now offering the meaty treat in the most unlikely of places – an ice-cream sundae. The sundae – vanilla soft serve drizzled with fudge, caramel, bacon crumbles and a piece of ‘thick-cut bacon’ - started in Nashville, Tennessee earlier this year and today launched nationwide. However, the news isn’t all good; the dessert packs a caloric punch, with 510 calories, 18 grams of fat, and 61 grams of sugar. Piggy pudding: Burger King has introduced a bacon sundae as part of its new menu items for the summer; it packs a caloric punch and has 61g sugar . And then there’s the rest of Burger King’s summer menu. The world's second biggest hamburger chain is also launching several pork, beef and chicken sandwiches as limited time offers to go with the bacon sundae. The items are Burger King's latest push to win back customers with a revived menu and reverse sliding market share, an effort that started soon after the company was taken private by the private equity firm 3G Capital in late 2010. Earlier this year, Burger King launched its biggest-ever menu expansion including fruit smoothies, snack wraps and new salads. The items were intended to go after a broader audience of moms and families, a shift from the chain's previous strategy of courting young men with calorie bombs. Summer special: Burger King is also offering other summer specials, including BBQ sandwiches and Whoppers . Core menu items, such as French fries and the Whopper, have also been tweaked as part of the company's efforts to improve food quality. Burger King is trying to underscore its own focus on ingredients with a new tag line, ‘Taste Is King,’ which replaces ‘Have It Your Way.’ A new ad has been celebrating summer barbecues to highlight the chain's emphasis on fire-grilling burgers. The new summer items will be featured in ads starting Thursday. This month, 3G plans to take Burger King public on the New York Stock Exchange. Wendy's is also revamping its menu to improve ingredients and recast itself as a higher-end burger chain. The makeovers by the hamburger giants come at a time when the traditional fast-food chains are seeing more competition from smaller players such as Five Guys Burgers and Smashburger that offer higher-quality food, and more health-conscious alternatives such as Subway. Burger King isn't the only fast-food chain that's trying to draw attention with unusual offerings. Taco Bell earlier this year introduced its tacos with Doritos shells and a ‘nacho burrito’ that includes corn chips. And bacon desserts are hardly anything new. Many non-chain restaurants across the country offer some combination of ice cream and the salty, fatty meat, from milkshakes to sundaes and everything in between.

chatgpt: Burger King is changing up their menu just in time for summer, and one of the new additions is catching everyone’s attention: the bacon sundae. While Burger King may be known for their burgers and fries, this new dessert is sure to make waves. According to Burger King’s announcement, the bacon sundae is made up of vanilla soft serve ice cream, fudge, caramel, bacon crumbles, and a piece of bacon on top. It sounds like an interesting combination, but some nutrition experts are already sounding alarms about the calorie count. At a hefty 510 calories, 18g of fat, and a whopping 61g of sugar, the bacon sundae is certainly not for the faint of heart. In fact, health advocates are already criticizing the dessert for its high levels of sugar and fat. Some are even calling it a “caloric bomb” that should be avoided at all costs. Despite these concerns, Burger King is already touting the bacon sundae as one of the highlights of the new summer menu. In addition to the sundae, the menu will also include frozen lemonade, BBQ sandwiches, and sweet potato fries. However, it’s the bacon sundae that is generating the most buzz. For those who are curious about the taste, early reviews from taste testers have been mixed. Some have praised the combination of salty bacon and sweet ice cream, while others have called it a “strange and unappetizing” dessert. Nevertheless, Burger King seems confident that the bacon sundae will be a hit with customers. Of course, the availability of the bacon sundae at Burger King highlights a larger trend in the fast food industry: the push towards ever more indulgent and calorie-laden foods. Critics argue that these types of foods contribute to the obesity epidemic in the United States, and urge fast food chains to offer healthier options. For their part, Burger King claims that they are committed to offering a range of options for customers, including salads and other lighter fare. However, there is no denying that the bacon sundae is a far cry from a garden salad. Ultimately, the decision to indulge in a bacon sundae is up to each individual consumer. While the dessert may be tempting, it’s important to keep in mind that the high calorie and sugar count could have negative health consequences. In the end, it’s all about finding a balance between treating yourself and making healthy choices.
