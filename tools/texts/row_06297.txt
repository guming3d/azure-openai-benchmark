article: Sending a package abroad? Here's a word of advice: Pick your airline carefully. A hilarious video has captured the care - or distinct lack there of - taken by an air freight handler at Guangzhou airport in China recently. The worker energetically ditches a trolley full of boxes in the general vicinity of a conveyer belt, which is supposed to transport them inside the airplane. But only a few actually hit their target, with most landing on the tarmac with a crash. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Crash: A hilarious video has captured the care - or distinct lack there of - taken by air freight handlers at Guangzhou airport in China . Filming out the window, a passenger on the China Southern Airlines flight is astounded at the bizarre technique. 'These blokes don't give a damn,' the Australian passenger, Mark Bridgman, says on the tape, which he later uploaded to YouTube. 'What a half-witted idiot. More end up on the ground than are going on the conveyer belt.' 'Don't put your air freight with China Southern,' he adds. Fragile? The boxes are chucked aggressively in the direction of the conveyor belt . Cleaning up: The worker has to handle all the boxes twice because so few of them made the conveyor belt the first time . 'He's going to have to handle them all twice because most of them are on the ground. Fricking turkey. What an idiot. Goodness knows what's in there. Hope it's not fragile.' It's unclear what is inside the fairly uniform boxes shown on the tape. However, Bridgman notes in his YouTube commentary that on a previous occasion he witnessed Japanese sewing machines plastered with 'this way up' and 'fragile, handle with care' stickers being treated with the same respect. Quick chat: The worker stops work to answer his cell phone . Mid air: The packages are thrown sky high and crash onto the tarmac . At one point, the handler answers his cell phone, but continues throwing the boxes towards the belt one-handed. 'This was amazing to watch. I think I was the only one noticing what was happening outside the window of the plane,' Bridgman wrote under the video, which has garnered more than 75,500 views. 'Lesson: Pack it well, because it wont be treated well.' Looking at his handy work: The worker takes a break and views his strike rate . All done: Finally the trolley is empty, but only a handful of packages made it onto the conveyor belt .

chatgpt: In a shocking display of negligence, a newly surfaced video shows air freight handlers at Guangzhou airport in China carelessly throwing packages onto a China Southern Airlines plane. The video, taken by a passenger waiting to board their flight, shows workers tossing boxes onto the conveyor belt. However, most of the boxes miss their target and either bounce off the belt and onto the tarmac or fall completely off course. The footage, which has since been posted on YouTube, has sparked outrage among viewers who are concerned about the safety of their packages while in transit. Many are questioning the training and supervision of the workers at Guangzhou airport. The incident is particularly concerning during a time where the transport industry has seen a significant increase in demand due to the pandemic. With more people relying on online shopping like never before, delivery services have been struggling to keep up with the influx of orders. The risk of damages and lost packages is already a concern for many consumers, and these careless actions by the air freight handlers only add to the fear. Dealing with lost or damaged packages can be a time-consuming and frustrating process, and no consumer wants to worry about their parcels being damaged before they even leave the airport. China Southern Airlines has not yet made a statement regarding the incident. However, it is hoped that they will address the matter and take corrective action as necessary. Airports and airlines across the globe must prioritize safe and secure handling of packages to ensure customer satisfaction and maintain public trust. The video serves as a stark reminder of the need for proper training and accountability measures for all workers involved in the transportation and handling of goods. Regardless of the volume of packages being processed, there must always be strict adherence to safety regulations, as one careless move could have disastrous consequences. In conclusion, the footage of air freight handlers recklessly throwing packages onto a China Southern Airlines plane is alarming and highlights the importance of better training and supervision of workers in the industry. It is hoped that corrective measures will be taken to ensure that all packages are handled with care and arrive at their destination safely.
