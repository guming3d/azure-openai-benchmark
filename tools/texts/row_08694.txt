Court: Police officer Thomas Grant 'ruined' his career by researching a woman he fancied on the force's computers . A police officer illegally used a force computer to access details of a woman he fancied, but was caught out when he accidentally entered the details of the wrong person. Thomas Grant, a Sussex Police constable since 2008, was looking for police records on a woman he was sending text messages to. But Brighton Magistrates’ Court heard today that the 24 -year-old had accessed the records of someone with a similar name - a witness to criminal damage. Juliet Evans, prosecuting, said: 'He fancied her and thought he might have some luck in dating her. 'He was using the police computer for non-policing purposes.' The Sussex Police constable searched the woman's records in the early hours of May 1 while he was on duty at Bognor Police Station. He initially denied any wrongdoing but eventually admitted obtaining data without the consent of the data controller, an offence under the Data Protection Act 1988. Miss Evans said the woman he researched did not know Grant - who has since resigned. She said she was upset when she found out what he had been doing. Kim Goodall, defending, said Grant's actions were 'stupid' and he had 'ruined' his career. She added: 'He's ended his career in the police force. He knew he would be caught - he apologises.' He was fined £800. Speaking after the hearing Grant, of Bognor, West Sussex, said: 'I'm just glad that this is over. 'I just want to thank my friends, family and former colleagues for supporting me.' In the dock: Brighton Magistrates' Court heard that the 24 year old officer had accessed the records of someone with a similar name - a witness to criminal damage . On the job: The Sussex Police constable searched the woman's records in the early hours of May 1 while he was on duty at Bognor Police Station (pictured). He has now resigned . Sussex Police Detective Sergeant Niall Moloney said: 'The misuse of force computers or systems by either officers or staff for anything other than a policing purpose is totally unacceptable and is not tolerated by Sussex Police. 'Any allegation of this kind is investigated thoroughly. 'Members of the public can be assured that their details are safe with us. 'Anyone who attempts to undermine that confidence will be dealt with swiftly and robustly.'

chatgpt: A former police officer has resigned and given a fine of £800 after accessing the personal details of a woman he was texting. Thomas Grant was looking for police records on the woman, but due to an error, he mistakenly accessed the records of someone with a similar name. According to reports, the woman was said to be upset when she found out that her personal details had been accessed without her permission. The woman's privacy was breached when Mr Grant obtained her contact details and accessed her records for personal reasons. Mr Grant, who had worked for the police for over 16 years, pleaded guilty to the offence at his trial. During the hearing, he expressed remorse for his actions, recognizing that he had let his curiosity and personal interest get in the way of his professional duties. Following the conclusion of the trial, Mr Grant resigned from his job, ending a long-standing career in the police force. The trial judge described his actions as serious and unprofessional and stated that he had caused unnecessary distress to the woman and had undermined public confidence in the police force. This case highlights the importance of protecting personal data and ensuring that it is not exploited for personal gain. It also emphasizes the need for police officers to maintain the highest levels of professionalism and integrity in their work. The police force has a responsibility to safeguard the sensitive information of its citizens, and any breach of this trust can have severe consequences. The case of Thomas Grant serves as a stark reminder to all employees who have access to sensitive information to handle such data with the utmost care and respect for privacy. At a time when data breaches and privacy violations are increasingly prevalent, this case stresses the impetus for officials and organizations alike to invest more in data protection and to establish more stringent rules and regulations to govern the handling of sensitive data. Cases like these serve as a poignant reminder that even a momentary lapse in judgement can have significant consequences, not only for the individual worker but also for the organizations they represent. It is a lesson that is not lost on the police force or the public when it comes to the delicate balance between safeguarding privacy and accessing personal data for lawful and ethical purposes.
