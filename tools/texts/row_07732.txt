Food for thought: Tutor Paul Ashworth was caught on film feeding a wild rat near the school's kitchen (file picture) Pest control experts were called in to the 900 pupil school near Chesterfield after fears that the pregnant rat could start an infestation. A furious parent reported the incident to the school after seeing the video on the social networking site and an investigation has been launched. Mandy Sludds, told The Sun: ‘For staff to encourage wild rats not far from where children are eating and playing is just diabolical. 'This was stupid, mindless behaviour from an adult in charge of sorting out children behaving badly. 'The bread had been put out for the rat not far from the kitchen block. It was a big, pregnant thing with a nest under a bush.' Rat problem: Springwell Community College launched an investigation after a school tutor was filmed feeding a wild rat . The footage was filmed by a female student on her mobile phone and shows the rat as it ran in and out of its nest to grab the food, the girl was then allegedly warned by Ashworth and his two colleagues not to show the video to anyone. Ms Sludds, from Staveley in Derbyshire, added: 'It was particularly bad because the school has only been up a couple of years, but the old building on the site had a real rat problem.' Ms Sludds’ children, Shannon, 15, and Reece, 12, plus a friend stayed off school for a day in protest of the incident. In the film, one of the men calls out: 'Come on you little sod. It's obviously a clever rat.' Ashworth is then heard saying: ‘Fresh meat.’ He refused to comment, saying: ‘It's being dealt with by my line manager.' Acting head Tracey Burnside confirmed pest controllers were called to put down rat traps. She said in The Sun: 'Clearly staff should not put out food for any animals on school grounds. 'We understand that the bread was on the ground near the rat for a short period of time but have launched an investigation.'

chatgpt: A tutor at a local college has become the subject of controversy after a video of him feeding a rodent bread alongside two of his colleagues was posted on Facebook. The video shows the tutor, identified as Mr. Ashworth, laughing as he feeds the animal. The post quickly gained traction, and soon after, a concerned parent lodged a complaint with the college. The incident has led to an investigation into the tutor's conduct, as he is tasked with improving the behaviour of students at the college. The college has released a statement condemning the behaviour shown in the video, stating that they will not tolerate any actions that go against the values of the institution. The video was initially posted by one of the colleagues who were seen in the video with Mr. Ashworth. The post included the caption, "Feeding the classroom pet during break time with the boys". It has since been taken down, but not before it was shared widely on social media. The parent who lodged the complaint expressed concern over the impact that the incident could have on the students' learning environment. Speaking to a news outlet, they said, "I'm worried about the message that this sends to the students. How can they be expected to learn and behave appropriately when the tutor himself is behaving in such an unprofessional manner?" The incident sparked debate among social media users, with many condemning the tutor's actions. One user commented, "This is completely unacceptable behaviour for a tutor. How can we expect students to follow the rules when their own tutors are not setting a good example?" It remains to be seen what action the college will take following the investigation. They have assured the public that they will take the matter seriously and will take the necessary steps to ensure that such incidents do not happen again. This is not the first time that social media has been used to expose inappropriate behaviour in educational institutions. In recent years, there have been numerous instances of teachers and tutors being caught in compromising situations. These incidents highlight the importance of holding educators to a high standard of conduct. Students look up to their teachers and tutors for guidance, and it is crucial that these individuals set a good example for them to follow. In conclusion, the incident involving Mr. Ashworth has raised concerns over the conduct of tutors in educational institutions. The college's investigation into the matter will hopefully lead to a resolution and ensure that students are taught in a professional and appropriate manner.
