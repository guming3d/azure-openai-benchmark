article: (CNN) -- Imagine a bird that couldn't fit in your living room because its wings were too big. That's exactly what would happen if you tried to bring the Pelagornis sandersi home -- assuming houses and humans existed back then. Scientists have identified the fossils of what could be the largest flying bird ever found. With an estimated 20- to 24-foot wingspan, the extinct P. sandersi was twice the size of today's biggest flying bird, the royal albatross, according to the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center in North Carolina. Researchers believe the P. sandersi lived about 25 million to 28 million years ago. 53 spectacular wildlife photos from around the world . The avian giant's long, slender wings and paper-thin hollow bones allowed it to stay aloft for long distances without flapping its wings, the center said. But that doesn't mean the mammoth bird didn't have size issues while trying to fly. Because it was probably too big to take off from a standstill, the P. sandersi may have had to run downhill into a headwind to achieve takeoff -- just like a hang glider would. The bird's fossils were first unearthed 31 years ago when construction workers started working on a new terminal at Charleston International Airport in South Carolina. The remains -- including a complete skull and multiple wing and leg bones -- were so big they had to be dug up with a backhoe. But the weight of the discovery wasn't publicized until this week, when scientists unveiled the findings in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The remains of the P. sandersi now rest in the Charleston Museum. The big bird's name honors retired Charleston Museum curator Albert Sanders.

chatgpt: Scientists have discovered the possible largest flying bird ever to exist, named P. sandersi. The gigantic bird had paper-thin hollow bones, similar to those found in modern-day birds. However, it was likely only capable of flying after a running start. The P. sandersi lived 25 million to 28 million years ago during the Eocene epoch. The discovery of P. sandersi's bones was purely coincidental when construction workers were building an airport terminal in Charleston, South Carolina. The workers noticed a bone sticking out of the ground and contacted the Charleston Museum. Researchers were brought in to excavate the area, and they discovered a wealth of fossils, including the largest flying bird ever. The P. sandersi weighed around 22 pounds and had a wingspan of between 20 and 24 feet. That's three times larger than the Royal Albatross, the largest modern-day bird with the longest wingspan. Its wings were designed for long-distance flying, and it most likely fed on small mammals, reptiles, and insects. The P. sandersi's discovery provides scientists with insight into the evolution of early birds, including their size and anatomy. Their findings suggest that the bird's paper-thin hollow bones, which are also found in other modern-day birds, played a crucial role in allowing it to fly. The bones allowed for the bird's wings to be lighter, giving it the ability to soar through the air with greater ease. Despite its enormous wingspan, researchers believe that the P. sandersi couldn't take off vertically like many modern-day birds. Instead, it was likely to have needed a running start before using its wings to lift off the ground. The discovery of P. sandersi has provided researchers with a rare opportunity to learn more about the early evolution of flight and the unique adaptations that birds developed to become one of the world's most successful animal groups. The fossil findings also highlight the importance of continued research in tracking the evolution of birds and the environmental factors that contributed to the development of different species.
