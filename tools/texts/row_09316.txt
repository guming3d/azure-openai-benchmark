Parents of pupils at an all-girls' grammar school were given an unexpected surprise when they clicked on on a website associated with the school to find it plastered with raunchy images. Families hoping for information to do with Highworth Grammar School, in Ashford, Kent, would have been left with something entirely different when clicking on highworthgrammar.co.uk, a web address formerly used by the establishment. It is now adorned with six pictures of scantily-clad women - some topless - and links to webcam and sex chat sites. Raunchy: The explicit website, which was formerly run by the all-girls Highworth Grammar School in Ashford, Kent . They include a woman wearing nothing but knickers and stockings - and holding her breasts with her hands. There were also x-rated . adverts for casual sex, cam chats, and affairs, linking to other explicit sites. Although the school changed its domain name three years ago, some parents have mistakenly followed to old link to be confronted by the explicit content. The address has been bought up by an unknown company which filled the web page with the sexual images and links. And although the school is now attempting to buy back the domain and remove the images, there is no guarantee they will be successful. Switch: Highworth, pictured, swapped away from its previous web address three years ago . Contrast: The school's official website, which switched to its current address three years ago . A school spokesman said: 'Parents were informed of the changes to the new name and clearly this was acted upon by the great majority of our parents. 'We also ensured that any links within the internet had been updated to the best of our ability. 'We have received very few contacts from parents about this problem when they have used a favourite bar or history link and they have been most understanding when we have explained what has occurred. 'Since there was a fair period of time between us moving to our new address and the old address being used to redirect to the adult site, we did not feel that raising general public awareness was warranted and for it to act as free advertising for such adult sites. 'Highworth Grammar School is obviously concerned about the use of the old internet address for such purposes and apologises for any offence to anyone who has inadvertently accessed to old site. 'The school's old address was maintained for a period of time after the switch over, redirecting browsers to the updated home page. 'But the school dropped its subscription, allowing others to purchase the domain. We are not in a position to purchase this address back until it next becomes available on the market and we are monitoring the availability. 'Clearly an address advertised and therefore receiving hits is less likely to be released for purchase by the current licence holder.'

chatgpt: Parents of students at Highworth Grammar School in Ashford, Kent were shocked to discover a sexually explicit website that was linked to the school's former domain. The website featured raunchy images and explicit links, causing great concern for parents and school authorities alike. According to reports, the site was once connected to the domain of Highworth Grammar School. The domain was later switched away from the site in 2011, but the address was still available and was bought up by someone else. The new owner transformed the site into a platform for sexually explicit content, featuring scantily-clad women and links to explicit material. Several parents were said to have stumbled upon the site, which caused great concern for them. They contacted the school authorities to express their distress and to demand action to be taken against the site. The school authorities were quick to respond to the situation, with efforts made to try and buy back the domain from the person who had acquired it. However, there is no guarantee that the school will be successful in their bid to purchase the domain. The school's headteacher, Anne Kelly, assured parents that they will do everything they can to try and regain ownership of the domain. However, she also highlighted the difficulties that come with trying to retrieve a domain that has already been bought by someone else. In a statement, the school said, "We are aware that a website that was linked to our former domain now features sexually explicit content. We would like to assure parents and the wider community that we are taking this matter seriously and are actively working to resolve the issue." The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of safeguarding students and protecting them from inappropriate content online. The school has procedures in place to ensure that all internet activity is monitored and restricted, but it is evident that more needs to be done to prevent such incidents from occurring. The incident has caused great distress for parents and the school, highlighting the need for more stringent measures to be put in place to prevent individuals from buying and exploiting unused domain names. This is not the first time that a school has been subject to such an incident, with similar cases reported in the past. The incident serves as a timely reminder for schools and other organisations to be vigilant when it comes to protecting their online presence and reputation. In conclusion, the incident has highlighted the need for greater awareness and vigilance when it comes to online safety and protecting young people from potentially harmful content. The school is taking action to try and regain control of their domain, but the incident raises questions about how such situations can be prevented in the future.
