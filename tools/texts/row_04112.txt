article: Tokyo (CNN) -- Japan has slipped to the world's third largest economy, falling behind the blistering speed of China's manufacturing growth, according to Japanese figures released Monday. Japan's cabinet office released its nominal gross domestic product figures for 2010. Japan's economy was valued at US $5.4742 trillion dollars while China was at US $5.8786 trillion. Japan's economy did grow in 2010, but only 3.9%, according to the government. China's is expected to grow more than 10%. At the speed China is growing, Japan's government predicts China will overtake the United States as the world's largest economy in less than 20 years. China has expanded domestic industries and infrastructure, driven by a surge in exports. Multinational corporations have expanded in China, taking advantage of low labor costs. Japan, meanwhile, has been stuck in stagnation and deflation for two decades. Decisive economic policy has been lost in the revolving door of the country's top leader, with Japan seeing six prime ministers in just five years. Looking ahead, Japan is facing a demographic tsunami, with the world's fastest aging population and one of the globe's lowest birth rates. On the national debt issue, Japan's parliament is struggling to cap its GDP-to-debt ratio, which is nearing 200% -- the world's highest among developed nations. The size of an economy does not tell the entire picture: Japan's GDP per head is around $40,000 while China's is $4,500. The standards of living remain remarkably different in the two countries. But the economic size of a country gives a snapshot of not just the financial influence of a nation, but its power in the world's political sphere.
highlights: Japan's economy is now third in the world, with China moving into second place . The United States remains the world's largest economy . Japan's government predicts China will overtake the U.S. in less than 20 years .

chatgpt: Japan's economy has moved down to third place in the world, with China overtaking it to claim second place. However, the United States still holds on to its position as the world's largest economy. The latest figures from the World Bank show that China's economy grew to $14.14 trillion in 2019, while Japan's was $5.15 trillion. The United States remained the largest economy, with a GDP of $21.43 trillion. Japan's economic decline is not a surprise, as the country has been struggling to revive its economy for the past few years. The coronavirus pandemic has only exacerbated the situation, leading to a recession in the country. In fact, Japan's economy shrank by a record 27.8% in the second quarter of 2020. However, the Japanese government predicts that China will overtake the United States as the world's largest economy in less than 20 years. Some experts even believe that the shift could happen as early as 2028. China's rapid economic growth over the past few decades has been driven by its massive population and focus on exports. The country has become a manufacturing giant, with many Western companies outsourcing their production to China. Meanwhile, the United States has also been struggling in recent years, with a growing wealth gap and political divisions. The coronavirus pandemic has also hit the country hard, with millions of job losses and a sharp decline in economic activity. While Japan's decline is unfortunate, it is not necessarily unexpected given the current economic landscape. The focus now shifts to the global race between China and the United States for economic dominance in the coming years.
