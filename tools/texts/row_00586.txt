She said: 'It’s disgraceful. How dare someone cash in on our heritage. It’s not an homage, it’s an abomination. 'I very much doubt The Queen has ever eaten a kebab, and I very much doubt she ever would. You’re simply not allowed to use Her Majesty as a marketing tool.'

chatgpt: Chingford, London - Residents of Chingford were surprised to see the town's popular kebab restaurant, Petra, renamed as The Queen. The kebab shop, owned by local businessman Hussein Ibrahim, 42, has been decorated with pictures and portraits of Her Majesty the Queen.  The sudden rebranding has raised concerns and questions from the local community, as well as from many across the country, causing Buckingham Palace to investigate the matter further. Many are wondering if the use of Her Majesty's name and image is authorized by the Royal Family. However, Hussein Ibrahim has defended his decision, stating that the renaming of the restaurant and the use of Her Majesty's image is an expression of his love and admiration for the Royals. He says that he did not intend to cause any harm or difficulty to the Royal Family and that he believed that the new name and décor would bring a sense of pride to the local community. The response to the changes has been mixed; some believe that the name and the decor seem distasteful and potentially disrespectful, while others find it humorous and endearing. Sheila Watts, a local resident who used to frequent the restaurant, says that she is confused by the change, "I don't understand why he would do that. It doesn't make much sense."  On the other hand, Ibrahim's new decision has attracted many new customers to his business. Jacky, a regular visitor to The Queen, says that he likes the new look and feels that Ibrahim has created a fun atmosphere. "It's a bit different, but it's still the same delicious kebab that I've come to love," he says. Buckingham Palace has stated that they are aware of the situation and that they are taking appropriate steps to investigate the issue. The use of the Queen's name and image is regulated by a strict set of guidelines, and any unauthorized usage can result in legal action. In conclusion, the renaming of the kebab shop in Chingford as The Queen has caused quite a stir. While some are embracing the new look, others are unsure of its appropriateness. The Royal Family is taking this situation seriously, and it remains to be seen what action will be taken.
