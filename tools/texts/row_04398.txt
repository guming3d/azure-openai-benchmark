SEE ALSO: 13 Robots Who Don't Know How to Robot . Travelers can leave their cars at the arrival level of the ParkingPLUS structure. As they leave, they confirm on a touch-screen that no one is in the car. The robot valet, nicknamed "Ray," takes it from there. The robot measures the vehicle, picks it up with a forklift-like system, and takes it to the back area, where it will position it in one of the 249 parking spots reserved for automated valets. The machine is capable of carrying standard cars weighing up to 3.31 tons. The robot valet is even connected to the airport's flight data system, and by checking customer trip data with the database, Ray knows when the customer will return for the vehicle. A traveler can note any itinerary changes in a parking app, which is available for iOS and Android. Düsseldorf's airport is relatively small, and officials touted the convenience of heading to the terminal from the parking structure entrance. Ray "makes the distances between planes and passengers' vehicles even shorter," according to a statement from the airport. "Our product is especially appealing to business travelers, who arrive at the airport shortly before the flight, seek efficient parking, and return within a few days," said Thomas Schnalke, the airport's managing director. The introductory rate for robot valet parking at Düsseldorf is 29 euros ($39.59) per day or 4 euros ($5.46) per hour. Although the airport is targeting business travelers in a hurry, the service is open to anyone. If airport customers use the robot valet, airport officials said they would consider expanding the system. Ray was produced by Serva Transport in the Bavarian town of Grabenstätt. Serva previewed the robot valet in 2013; Düsseldorf is the first installation of the system.

chatgpt: The Dusseldorf International Airport has introduced a new way for travelers to park their cars. A robot valet called "Ray" has been introduced to manage the parking of cars at the airport. The valet uses a forklift system to park and retrieve cars, making the process faster and more efficient. The robot valet is wired to the airport's flight system, which allows it to know when travelers will return. This means that the valet can have the car ready and waiting for its owner when they land. The system is designed to save travelers time and make the airport experience more seamless. The process of using the robot valet is simple. Travelers drop off their car at a designated area and leave their keys with the robot valet. Ray then uses its forklift system to move the car to a designated parking spot. When the traveler returns, Ray retrieves the car and brings it back to the designated area for pickup. The cost of using the robot valet service is about $40 per day, which is slightly more expensive than traditional parking options at the airport. However, the convenience of having the car parked and ready for pickup upon return may be worth the extra cost for some travelers. The introduction of the robot valet system is part of an effort by the airport to improve the travel experience for passengers. The use of technology is becoming increasingly popular in airports, with many airlines and airports introducing new systems to improve efficiency and convenience. The implementation of the robot valet system at Dusseldorf International Airport is expected to be popular with travelers, particularly those who are looking for a hassle-free airport experience. The system is also expected to be beneficial for the airport, as it will help to reduce congestion in the parking lots and make parking more efficient. Overall, the introduction of the robot valet service at Dusseldorf International Airport is a positive development for travelers. With its efficiency and convenience, the system is likely to be popular with those traveling through the airport.
