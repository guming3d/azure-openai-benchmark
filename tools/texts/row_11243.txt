article: (EW.com)  -- Will Ferrell, blithe impersonator of obtuse elves, TV anchormen, and former presidents, is not the first actor one thinks of to play Nick Halsey, an alcoholic wretch on a bender, in the sober indie drama "Everything Must Go." On one rock-bottom day, Nick is fired from his sales job and his wife leaves him, having first changed the locks and piled all his possessions in their suburban front yard. The sight of indoor stuff splayed outdoors may be absurd. But there is nothing at all funny about the pathetic mess Nick continues to make of his life. And Ferrell, whose vaguely uncomprehending onscreen stare usually signals amusing male cluelessness to come, upends expectations from the very first scene, as Nick sits in his car, locked in a traffic standstill and palpably unable to endure the stress without a pull on his liquor flask. With characteristic physical fearlessness, the actor becomes a downward-spiraling alcoholic. No joke. It's a terrific performance -- one that's unmatched by the rest of the movie, written and directed by Dan Rush. Based on Raymond Carver's notable short story ''Why Don't You Dance?,'' "Everything Must Go" is a sweetened-up, padded-out scenario of hope cracking through a drunk's despair. Rush's background as a director of commercials is evident in his feature-film debut: Everything and everyone look 10 degrees softer and more composed than they need to be. Carver's original minimalist story goes down in two gulps: The drinking guy sells his stuff to a young couple passing by. The end. Rush's adaptation skips the young couple, expands the yard sale, and adds a cop who's Nick's AA sponsor (Michael Peña). EW.com: See all of this week's reviews . There's also: a lonely black kid who becomes Nick's protégé (Christopher Jordan Wallace); an old high school classmate (Laura Dern, in a fine, subtle, self-contained scene) who assures Nick that he really does have a heart; and a neighbor across the street (Rebecca Hall) who's pregnant. Despite Nick's worst, hurtful behavior toward her, she's willing to extend a kind of forgiveness. Ferrell, for his part, looks like he would have no problem going even deeper and darker than Rush could bear. Like Bill Murray and Greg Kinnear before him, this funnyman reveals serious acting chops.

chatgpt: In the world of cinema, it's not uncommon for actors to deliver great performances even when the director's vision falls short. This seems to be the case with "Everything Must Go," a sober indie drama featuring the talented Will Ferrell in the lead role. However, critics have stated that Ferrell's exceptional acting talent is not matched by director Dan Rush. Rush, whose commercial background comes through in the film, seems to rely heavily on Ferrell's comedic abilities, which are mostly absent in this film. "Everything Must Go" follows the story of Nick Halsey, an alcoholic who loses his job and wife in the same day. As a result, his life spirals into a series of troubling events and moments of self-discovery. Ferrell's portrayal of Nick Halsey is undoubtedly the highlight of the film. The actor manages to tap into the character's deep-seated pain and struggles with addiction, creating a character that is both relatable and sympathetic. However, some observers have noted that Ferrell's departure from his usual comedic roles may come as a surprise to fans. While Ferrell's performance is praiseworthy, the same cannot be said for Rush's direction. The film feels disjointed in parts, with some scenes not quite fitting with the overall tone and theme of the movie. Additionally, the pacing of the film can be a little slow, which may test the patience of some viewers. Despite these flaws, "Everything Must Go" offers a poignant and at times humorous take on the challenges of addiction and loss. The film offers a glimpse into a life that is falling apart and may resonate with those who are dealing with similar problems. Will Ferrell's commendable performance makes this film a must-watch for those who appreciate actors stepping out of their comfort zones, even if the direction sometimes falls short. Overall, "Everything Must Go" is a sobering, character-driven drama that explores themes of addiction, loss, and redemption. While the film may not be perfect, Ferrell's terrific performance makes it worth watching. Director Dan Rush may have missed the mark at times, but the film still manages to deliver a powerful message about the highs and lows of life.
