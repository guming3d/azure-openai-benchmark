A building engineer conducting a quarterly inspection discovered her body Oct. 8 in the stairwell, which was 99 yards from her room and locked on the inside. The San Francisco coroner attributed Spalding's death to dehydration and an electrolyte imbalance likely related to chronic alcohol use but could not pinpoint when she died. Spalding's death sparked multiple investigations focusing on failures of communication between the hospital and sheriff's deputies - who provide security and conducted a haphazard search for the woman.

Spalding was a British expat living in the U.S. and was an alcoholic when receiving treatment for the bladder infection. A doctor had instructed staff in writing that the patient was never to be left unattended and when she was, nurses were blamed for not acting on the orders. A report obtained by The San Francisco Chronicle last year found 'systematic' failures at the hospital and said officials there never worked out an emergency plan with the Sheriff's Department. That created the risk of a 'chaotic and poorly coordinated' response that led to Spalding's death, the report said.
