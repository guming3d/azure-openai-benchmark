One person was taken to hospital after the discovery was made just after 11am this morning at the Dartford Crossing in Kent . Kent Police confirmed they were called to a report of suspected illegal immigrants but that the immigration service was managing the investigation. The discovery comes after 35 immigrants were found in a container at Tilbury Docks in Essex earlier this month. One of them, 40-year-old Meet Singh Kapoor, from Afghanistan, was found dead. The group included 13 children, who are all believed to have fled Afghanistan after suffering persecution. Two lorry drivers - Stephen McLaughlin, 34, of Limavady, Londonderry, Northern Ireland, and Timothy Murphy, 33 of Elmgrove, Londonderry - have been charged with conspiring to facilitate illegal entry into the UK. Across the English Channel in Calais, hundreds of migrants, mainly from Africa, are camping or living in squats, which has led to violent clashes erupting on the streets. Local officials have called on Britain to do more to share the burden of immigration, with the deputy mayor of Calais, Philippe Mignonet, appealing to the historic 'Entente Cordiale' between the two nations. The discovery led to heavy congestion on approaches to the area.Â The discovery comes after 35 immigrants were found in a container at Tilbury Docks in Essex earlier this month . Mr Mignonet said earlier this month that the port town had been saddled with an image of a 'theatre of war' as he called on David Cameron to 'come and see what we face'. The use of Calais as a stepping stone to Britain has long been a problem for France. In May, three makeshift migrant camps were evacuated and destroyed amid insanitary conditions and an outbreak of scabies.

In 2002, the French government closed the Sangatte Red Cross centre, near Calais, after repeated lobbying by then home secretary David Blunkett. This month, it was reported that Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart was planning a state-funded camp away from local residents amid the 'unbearable strain' of the high numbers of migrants .

chatgpt: A shocking discovery was made earlier today in the vicinity of a river crossing, as a group of people were found in distress. One person has been taken to the hospital while the rest of the individuals are being assessed by medical personnel. The discovery has led to heavy traffic congestion on the approaches to the river crossing as investigations take place. This incident comes after a similar discovery earlier this month, when 35 immigrants were found in a container at Tilbury Docks in Essex. These discoveries serve as a reminder of the ongoing struggle faced by those attempting to migrate to the UK. Details surrounding the condition of the individuals found today remain unclear, but initial reports indicate that they may have been in the container for some time. The individuals are believed to be migrants attempting to make their way to the UK, with the river crossing serving as a common pathway for those seeking to enter the country illegally. This is not the first time that illegal immigrants have been found at the scene of the river crossing, with similar discoveries made in the past. The issue of illegal immigration has been a contentious one, with politicians and lawmakers divided over how best to combat the problem. While efforts have been made to increase border security and implement stricter immigration laws, these incidents serve as a stark reminder of the challenges faced by those attempting to migrate to the UK. Asylum seekers and refugees fleeing from war-torn countries and other dangerous situations often face significant barriers as they attempt to find safety and security in a new country. The discovery of these migrants today has caused significant disruptions along the approaches to the river crossing. Police and other authorities are currently on the scene attempting to investigate the incident and manage the traffic flow. The discovery has also highlighted the need for increased awareness and vigilance when it comes to issues of illegal immigration and human trafficking. While these discoveries are alarming and highlight the complex issues surrounding migration, they also serve as a reminder of the ongoing struggles faced by those attempting to find safety and a better life in a new country. It is important that a concerted effort is made to address these issues and provide support for those who are facing significant challenges in their attempt to migrate to the UK legally.
