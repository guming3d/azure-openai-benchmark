article: Pakistan emphatically ended Australia's hopes of regaining the number one Test ranking with a 221-run win in the first Test in Dubai. Australia entered the two-match series needing to win both games to displace South Africa at the top, but will instead head to Abu Dhabi later this week hoping to avoid a first series loss to Pakistan since 1994. Pakistan had won just two Tests against Australia in the intervening period - at one point losing 13 in a row - and while they were without mystery spinner Saeed Ajmal following his ban for an illegal bowling action, their slow men led the way to a memorable success. Zulfiqar Babar took his first five-wicket haul at the age of 35 as Pakistan won the first test against Australia . Mitchell Johnson made a defiant 61 before he was removed by Yasir Shah, stumped by Sarfraz Ahmed . Johnson's stumping paved the way for Pakistan to clean up Australia's tailend and win the first of two test . Left-armer spinner Zulfiqar Babar fittingly completed the job, and his first five-wicket Test haul at the age of 35, when Peter Siddle squeezed a bat-pad catch to Azhar Ali. Zulfiqar and debutant leg-spinner Yasir Shah claimed 14 wickets between them in the match to leave Australia in a spin ahead of the second Test. The tourists lurched to 105 for seven in the morning session before Steve Smith and Mitchell Johnson half-centuries offered the merest hope they might fight out a draw. Smith's wicket was the only to fall during the afternoon session, after he dug in for 55 from 175 balls, before he fell victim to Yasir, who returned four for 50. Smith had expertly used his feet to the slow men but after skipping down to the leg-spinner he popped a catch to short-leg with the umpire review confirming he had to make a slow walk off. Johnson was dejected at losing his wicket in a test Australia needed to win as the seek to top the world ranking . Peter Siddle (right) and Steve O'Keefe (left) leave the field after Australia were bowled out on the fifth day . Johnson then teamed with Siddle in a 43-run stand that took Australia into the final session of the match until he overstretched attempting to smother Yasir's spin. It was a close call that went Pakistan's way as TV umpire Nigel Llong ruled Johnson's back foot was still on the crease as wicketkeeper Sarfraz Ahmed removed the bails. Siddle then survived a reviewed lbw call by the barest of margins before Zulfiqar had him caught pressing further forward to finish with figures of five for 74 and seven wickets for the match.

chatgpt: Pakistan has secured a stunning 221-run win over Australia on day five of the first test in Dubai. The win has put Pakistan in good stead for the two-match series, while it has dashed Australia's hopes of taking the No.1 spot in the world test rankings.  Coming into day five of the first test, Pakistan had a strong hold on the game. They had scored 482 in their first innings before dismissing Australia for 202. After declaring at 181/6 in their second innings, Pakistan needed early wickets to limit Australia's chances of chasing down the 462-run target. Pakistan's left-arm spinner, Zulfiqar Babar, proved to be the hero of the day with his first five-wicket haul in his test career. The 35-year-old Babar claimed the wickets of Usman Khawaja, Mitchell Marsh, Tim Paine, Pat Cummins, and Nathan Lyon. Babar's achievement is particularly heartening for Pakistan as he contributed to a comprehensive win over Australia, one of the top test-playing nations in the world. His performance also reinforces Pakistan's reputation for producing talented cricketers.  While Australia gave it their all to chase down the target, Pakistan's bowlers were relentless in their pursuit of wickets. Spinner Yasir Shah took the crucial wickets of opener Aaron Finch and current Australian captain, Tim Paine. The Australian batsmen put up a fight, with Shaun Marsh scoring a gutsy 60, but it was not enough to save Australia from a crushing defeat.  The win has put Pakistan in pole position for the two-match series. Australia, on the other hand, will have to rely on a win in the final test in order to salvage the series and prevent Pakistan from taking the series outright. This win for Pakistan also highlights the importance of home advantage in test cricket. The game was played in Dubai, which is now Pakistan's new home for international cricket following a long-standing ban on playing in their home country. Playing in familiar conditions clearly paid off for Pakistan, while the Australian team struggled to adapt to the pitches and conditions they were faced with. Overall, it was a spectacular performance by Pakistan on day five. This win should give them a massive boost of confidence heading into the second test. For Australia, it's back to the drawing board before the final test begins.  Pakistan will now look to finish the series on a high by continuing their good form and extending their lead over Australia. With the likes of Babar and Shah in fine form, they will be optimistic about their chances of ending the series on a high note.
