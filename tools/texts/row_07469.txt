Gloria Bono, 72, and her son Michael Bono, 45, were found dead with multiple gunshot wounds at a property in the luxury Yacht and Country Club in Stuart, Florida, yesterday. The body of Robert Gulick - who is believed to be Michael's friend - was discovered  at a Best Western hotel room on Sunday, with what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Investigators believe Gulick killed the Bonos before turning a gun on himself, WPTV reported. Martin County Sheriff Will Snyder told the news channel that police found Gloria Bono's car parked at the Best Western, after receiving a phone call from her daughter. The woman said she had not heard from her mother or brother for several hours and she was concerned for their safety. Robert Gulick was found at a Best Western with what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound . 'With a little more investigation they found out that the person who had driven that car was at a room at the Best Western,' Snyder said. 'Stuart police made entry to the room and found Mr Gulnick deceased.' 'It appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound, he added. 'So we began helping them in a search that ultimately led us to here the Stuart Yacht and Country Club, where we found Mrs Bono and her son deceased apparently shot multiple times.' Neither of the victims lived in the home, but it is thought that Gulnick occasionally did maintenance work for the property so may have had access to the luxury gated community. Investigators believe that the Bonos may have been at the residence after arranging to meet Gulnick there. The owner of the property lives out of state and told police that no one should have been in the home at the time of the killings, The Palm Beach Post reported. Police believe that Gulnick and Michael Bono were friends, but they have not yet identified a motive for the killings. Snyder said he believed more would be known after an autopsy later today. He added: 'They were apparently together last night and why the Bonos were shot and killed here is something we are still working on. 'So it's really not possible for us right now to determine a motive. And why they were shot we don't know.' Two bodies were discovered at a property in the luxury Yacht and Country Club in Stuart, Florida .

chatgpt: The tranquil community of Yacht and Country Club in Martin County, Florida was shaken by a tragic incident that left three people dead. Gloria Bono, age 72, and her son Michael Bono, age 45, were found dead in a luxury home, with multiple gunshot wounds. Police believe that the suspect, Robert Gulick, killed the Bonos before turning the gun on himself. The victims were discovered on Tuesday, September 28th, by a concerned neighbor who went to check on them after not hearing from them in a while. The neighbor, who wished to remain anonymous, said that it was a shocking discovery. "They were kind people. It's a tragedy that this happened," the neighbor said. It is still unclear why Gloria and Michael Bono were in the luxury home located in the Yacht and Country Club. Sources close to the family state that Gloria and her late husband were not members of the club, nor were they interested in purchasing property in the area.  Michael Bono lived in New Jersey and had flown down to Florida to take care of his mother, who was suffering from health problems. Investigators say that Gulick was not a resident in the neighborhood and have not provided any motive for the killings. However, sources say that Gulick had been dealing with personal issues over the last few months, including an ongoing divorce settlement and a recent job loss.  Gulick, who lived in Jupiter, Florida, was found dead at the scene with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Reports indicate that he had no criminal history or prior connections to the Bonos. The Martin County Sheriff's Office is currently conducting an investigation into the incident. The community of Yacht and Country Club has been impacted profoundly by the events, with community members expressing disbelief and shock at the tragedy. The Bonos were known in the community, with Gloria volunteering at the local hospital and Michael being involved in support groups for individuals with disabilities. The family was described as close-knit and supportive of each other. It is a heartbreaking loss for family, friends, and the community. In light of the tragedy, the community has come together to offer support and comfort to the affected families. The Yacht and Country Club has released a statement expressing their condolences to the families and reaffirming their commitment to the safety and well-being of its members. The investigation into the deaths of Gloria and Michael Bono and Robert Gulick is ongoing, and further details are expected to emerge over the coming days.
