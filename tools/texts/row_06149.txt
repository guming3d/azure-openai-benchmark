chatgpt: The Dock Bar & Grill in Montauk, a popular watering hole located at the tip of Long Island, recently came under fire for a sign that was displayed in the establishment's window. The sign, which listed a number of items that were banned inside the bar, included a phrase that many found offensive: "Irish need not apply (except for . drunks)." According to reports, the sign was put up by the bar's owner, George Watson, in an attempt to keep rowdy patrons out of the establishment. However, the inclusion of the derogatory phrase aimed at Irish customers quickly caught the attention of local residents and visitors alike. Many took to social media to express their outrage at the sign, with some calling for a boycott of the Dock Bar & Grill. Some customers even took to leaving scathing reviews of the establishment on popular review sites like Yelp and TripAdvisor. In response to the backlash, Watson eventually decided to remove the sign from the window. However, he did not apologize for the offense it caused, instead stating that he had only included the phrase in an attempt to "lighten the mood" of the sign. Despite a lack of remorse from Watson, many customers were satisfied with the sign's removal. However, the story took another turn when it was revealed that Watson had replaced the sign with a new one that many argue is just as offensive. The new sign reads, "No Sensitive Drunks Allowed." While it may not include any specific reference to a particular group, many have pointed out that the phrase is still likely to offend those who suffer from conditions like addiction and other mental health issues. Critics of Watson argue that his tasteless signs are only hurting his own business, as more and more people express their distaste with the bar owner's behavior. Some have called for a boycott of the Dock Bar & Grill, while others have suggested that Watson should conduct sensitivity training for himself and his staff. Despite the controversy, the Dock Bar & Grill remains open for business. However, it remains to be seen whether or not Watson will take any steps towards making amends for his offensive signs, or if he will continue to push customers away with his divisive behavior.
