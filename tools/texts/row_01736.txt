article: Budapest, Hungary (CNN) -- One of the world's most wanted Nazi war suspects, Sandor Kepiro, 97, went on trial Thursday in Hungary charged with the slayings of 36 Jews and Serbs in Novi Sad, Serbia, in 1942. Kepiro, a former officer in the Hungarian gendarmerie, protested his innocence in the Budapest municipal court saying, "I am not guilty, and I have always lived a decent life." He denied having killed anyone during a raid on Novi Sad, instead claiming to have saved the lives of five people. And he said he did not know Jews or Serbs were the targets of the raid, saying that as far as he knew it was against anti-Nazi "partisans." Hungary sided with the Nazis early in World War II and in January 1942, its troops killed about 3,000 Jews and Serbs in Novi Sad, according to the Holocaust Encyclopedia. Hungary had annexed the territory at the time. Kepiro said he never participated in or saw any deportation of Jews. Ten minutes before the trial, he said he did not expect so many people to come, that the charges are lies, and that he is innocent. When the trial began Kepiro said he could not hear and hardly sees anything, but as proceedings continued he appeared to be able to follow them. Kepiro's daughter held a sign accusing the court of being "killers" for persecuting an "old man." But Nazi hunter Efraim Zuroff was dubious. "This is a show, Sandor," he shouted at the defendant when Kepiro arrived in court, suggesting that he was acting more frail than he was. Zuroff, the director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Israel, tracked down Kepiro in Budapest in 2006 and he said this could be one of the last Holocaust-era trials. "Time does not diminish the guilt of the killers and old age should not protect those who committed such heinous crimes," he said. Kepiro sued Zuroff for libel for calling him a war criminal. A Budapest court acquitted Zuroff this week. Kepiro's lawyer, Zsolt Zetenyi, said before trial that Jews should look for other ways to find justice. The court "is clearly not the venue" and Kepiro is innocent, Zetenyi said. Hungary's pro-Nazi government resisted deporting its own Jews to death camps, according to the Holocaust Encyclopedia. Germany occupied Hungary in 1944.

chatgpt: Sandor Kepiro, a 97-year-old Hungarian man, is facing trial for his alleged involvement in a 1942 raid that resulted in the deaths of Jews and Serbs. Kepiro claims he is innocent and that his actions actually saved lives, yet Nazi hunter Efraim Zuroff believes that time does not lessen the guilt of Nazi war criminals. According to the indictment, in January 1942 Sandor Kepiro, then a gendarmerie captain, participated in a raid in the city of Novi Sad, in northern Yugoslavia, where more than 1,200 Jews and Serbs were rounded up and killed. Kepiro denies these allegations and claims that he did not participate in the killings, but rather, he was assigned to search for weapons during the raid. Despite Kepiro's claims of innocence, Nazi hunter Efraim Zuroff believes that time does not erase the guilt of Nazi war criminals. He argues that no matter how much time has passed, justice must still be served. Zuroff, who serves as the Director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Israel office and is considered the world's foremost Nazi hunter, has been tracking Nazi war criminals for many years. Kepiro's lawyer, on the other hand, argues that the court is not the venue for Jews seeking justice. He claims that the case is merely an attempt to make an example out of Kepiro for political reasons. However, many Holocaust survivors and their families believe that Kepiro and others like him must be held accountable for their past actions. The trial, which began in Budapest in 2011, has brought up painful memories for many Holocaust survivors and their families. The proceedings have also raised questions about whether or not it is ever too late for justice to be served. Despite the fact that nearly 70 years have passed since the raid in Novi Sad, the case highlights the ongoing efforts to bring Nazi war criminals to justice. In conclusion, Sandor Kepiro's trial serves as a reminder that justice for the victims of the Holocaust and their families must never be forgotten. While Kepiro maintains his innocence, the trial highlights the need to hold individuals accountable for their actions, regardless of how much time has passed. As the world continues to grapple with the aftermath of one of the darkest periods in human history, Kepiro's trial is a sobering reminder of the importance of seeking justice and holding those who commit heinous crimes responsible for their actions.
