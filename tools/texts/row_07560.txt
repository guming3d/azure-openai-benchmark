chatgpt: In a shocking discovery, police have found the remains of a man more than a decade after he disappeared from his home in Jefferson, Maine. The man, Charles Woodburn, was reported missing in 2002 by concerned friends and family. However, an investigation at that time failed to turn up any leads, and the case went cold. But now, nearly 18 years later, a tip from a member of the public has led police to the location of Woodburn's remains. They were found buried in the yard of the property he shared with his wife, Diana Darling, who never reported his disappearance. The property is now owned by the second husband of Darling. The police have not disclosed how Woodburn may have died or who may be responsible for his death. However, they are treating the case as a homicide and have launched a full investigation. Residents of the quiet town of Jefferson have been left stunned by the news of Woodburn's death and the circumstances surrounding it. Local residents have described Woodburn as a kind and friendly man who was well-liked in the community. They are deeply disturbed by the fact that his wife never reported him missing and that his remains were found on the same property where she lived for many years. Darling passed away in 2010 at the age of 54, leaving many questions unanswered. Investigators have not ruled out the possibility that others may have been involved in Woodburn's death, and they are appealing to the public for any information that may help them piece together what happened. They are also asking anyone who may have had contact with Woodburn or Darling around the time of his disappearance to come forward. The discovery of Charles Woodburn's remains has reignited interest in this cold case and has given his loved ones some closure, albeit long overdue. As the investigation continues, the community of Jefferson is left grappling with the tragic loss of one of their own and the disturbing questions that remain unanswered about his death.
