article: (CNN) -- The in-laws of late Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev appeared Thursday before a federal grand jury in Boston, a family attorney said. Joshua Dratel -- the lawyer representing Katherine Russell, who was married to Tsarnaev before he died following a police shootout days after the deadly April bombing -- said that the widow's parents answered questions for four hours Thursday from the grand jury. But, citing grand jury secrecy rules, Dratel declined to elaborate further about what the Russells testified about. Christina Sterling, spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office for Massachusetts, said only that she "cannot confirm or deny the existence of a grand jury." Four people have been charged in connection with the Boston attack, including Russell's brother-in-law, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who is suspected of carrying out the attack along with his brother, Tamerlan, 26. Neither Katherine Russell nor her parents have been charged, and investigators haven't said what they believe she knew about the twin April 15 blasts that killed three people and injured more than 260 others. What did suspected bomber's widow know? A lawyer representing Russell, Amato DeLuca, said eight days after the bombing that Tamerlan Tsarnaev's widow was "doing everything she can to assist with the investigation." DeLuca said that Russell, then 24, knew nothing about any plan to plant explosives near the Boston Marathon's finish line and that reports her husband was involved came as an "absolute shock" to her and her family. A 2007 graduate of North Kingstown High School in Rhode Island, she moved that year to Boston -- where she met Tamerlan Tsarnaev at a nightclub -- and enrolled at Suffolk University. Russell dropped out of college her freshman year. Eventually, she converted to Islam before the couple married in a Massachusetts mosque in June 2010. Together, she and her husband had a daughter, who was 3 at the time of the Boston bombing. Tamerlan Tsarnaev reportedly stayed home to care for the girl while Russell worked long hours as a home health aide. CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.

chatgpt: The in-laws of the late Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who orchestrated the Boston Marathon bombing with his brother Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in 2013, appeared before a federal grand jury in Boston on Wednesday. The in-laws, whose identities were not immediately disclosed, were summoned to testify before the grand jury, which is investigating the bombings that killed three people and injured 264 others. According to a family lawyer, the in-laws answered questions during their appearance before the grand jury, but the lawyer did not elaborate on the nature of the questions or the answers they gave. The in-laws' appearance comes amid ongoing investigations into the bombings, which have been linked to the Tsarnaev brothers. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a shootout with police shortly after the bombings, while his younger brother, Dzhokhar, was captured and later sentenced to death for his role in the attacks. Tamerlan's widow, Katherine Russell, was married to him for three years before the bombings took place. Russell has maintained her innocence and denied having any knowledge of her husband's involvement in the bombings. Her lawyers have said she and her family were shocked to hear about Tamerlan's ties to the blasts. However, questions have lingered about whether Russell or any of her family members had any knowledge of the attack before it occurred. It is unclear if the in-laws' appearance before the grand jury is related to the ongoing investigations into the bombings or if it is part of a broader investigation into Tamerlan Tsarnaev's activities prior to the attacks. A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Boston declined to comment on the matter. The Boston Marathon bombings remain one of the most high-profile domestic terrorist attacks in recent memory. The bombings and the subsequent manhunt for the Tsarnaev brothers captivated the nation for days, and the attack resulted in a significant increase in security measures at public events across the country. As investigations into the bombings continue, authorities are working to piece together a complete picture of what led the Tsarnaev brothers to carry out the attack, and whether anyone else was involved in the planning or execution of the bombings. The in-laws' appearance before the grand jury could be a crucial step in that investigation.
