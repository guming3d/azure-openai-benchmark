article: CNN -- Fernando Alonso insists Ferrari will bounce back from Sunday's controversial European Grand Prix. Events in Valencia saw Red Bull's Mark Webber suffer a high-speed crash on lap ten, forcing the safety car to appear. Alonso claimed the race had been "manipulated" after his title rival Lewis Hamilton, of McLaren, overtook the safety car but still managed to finish second despite being hit with a 20-second drive-through penalty. The Spaniard left Valencia's street circuit frustrated after finishing in eighth place, securing only one point, and he later blamed the safety car incident for his poor finish calling the race "unfair" for those who "respected the rules and didn't overtake the yellow flag". Alonso says he now regrets reacting "emotionally" and for saying things that "can be interpreted wrongly". "I was very angry about everything that happened, " he told Ferrari's official website. "But now that anger has been transformed into positive energy driving a desire to fight back. "What I meant was that those drivers who, like us, respected the regulations, unfortunately, in this situation, suffered much more than those who broke them, even though they were given a penalty," he added. "And I am not referring to any of the drivers in particular. I was pleased to hear that the FIA has reacted promptly, calling an extraordinary meeting of the Sporting Working Group. "I am confident, certain even, that all the points up for discussion will be cleared up in a comprehensive fashion." Alonso now insists he has put the disappointment behind him and is now keen to get back to winning ways at the British Grand Prix on July 11. "Right from Tuesday morning, my mind was already focused on the next Grand Prix at Silverstone, where we will try and channel all that accumulated energy into the car to try and make up for what escaped us, for one reason or another, in Valencia."

chatgpt: Fernando Alonso, the Spanish Formula One driver, is determined to move on from the controversial events of last Sunday's European Grand Prix in Azerbaijan. The 29-year-old had a strong start to the race but found himself mired in traffic after a pit stop, ultimately finishing in seventh place. However, it was his post-race comments that sparked controversy. Alonso expressed his frustration with Lewis Hamilton, who had overtaken the safety car during the race. The safety car is brought out when there is a danger on the track, allowing the drivers to slow down and remain safe. Alonso believed that Hamilton's risky move had compromised safety and put other drivers in danger. In an interview after the race, Alonso admitted to acting "emotionally" and regretting his comments. However, he remained resolute in his belief that the safety of drivers should come first. Despite the disappointment of last week's race, Alonso remains confident in the actions of the FIA, the governing body of motorsports. He believes that they will take appropriate measures to ensure that safety remains a top priority. Regarding his own performance, Alonso is looking ahead to future races with renewed determination. "I'm happy with the car and the team," he commented, "and we will come back stronger." The Formula One community has expressed support for Alonso, with many praising his commitment to safety and his dedication to the sport. Alonso is widely regarded as one of the most talented drivers in the field, with two World Championships to his name. As the Formula One season progresses, Alonso and his team will undoubtedly continue to face challenges on the track. However, with his determination and focus on safety, the Spanish driver is poised to bounce back and achieve success in the coming races.
