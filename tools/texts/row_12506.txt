They were once vital industrial routes used to supply coal to Britain's biggest mines and home to hundreds of workers. But now relegated to leisure use, a unique collection of photos of Britain's canals give a rare insight into lives of the last generation to work the inland waterways. The new exhibition, An Inland Voyage, at the London Canal Museum includes pictures from the late 1940s and early 1950s before the use of the waterways changed forever.

chatgpt: London Canal Museum is currently hosting an exhibition of vintage photographs that showcase the everyday life at Hawkesbury Junction in Warwickshire during the 1940s and 1950s. The images are the product of the keen eye and passion of Robert Longden, a Coventry factory worker-turned-photographer, who captured the beauty and simplicity of the area. Longden, who passed away in 2012, was an avid photographer and spent considerable time capturing images of the canals and local communities. His pictures from Hawkesbury Junction offer a glimpse into a bygone era that has now all but disappeared. The exhibition, aptly named “Hawkesbury Junction: The Longdens Collection”, was curated by his daughter Carolyn, who inherited the stunning collection of photographs. The photographs on display showcase the rich history of the area, which was a hub for industrial activity at the time. They capture the day-to-day life of the people who lived and worked in the region, the boats that navigated the canals, and the buildings that dotted the landscape. One striking feature of Longden’s photographs is the way he captures the light and shadow. Some of his iconic images showcase the interplay of sunlight with the canal water, which results in a stunning display of reflections that seem to dance on the water's surface. Visitors to the exhibition will be transported back in time to the 1940s and 1950s and will get to experience the sights and smells of the region as it was back then. The exhibition is a testament to Longden’s keen eye and his passion for photography, which allows us to view Hawkesbury Junction through a different lens. Richard Parry, the chief executive of the Canal and River Trust, which manages the UK’s waterways, expressed his delight at the exhibition, saying that Longden’s images help to preserve the history and heritage of the canals. He added, “Hawkesbury Junction is an undoubtedly beautiful and fascinating part of our canal network, and the exhibition is a testament to the unique bond that exists between people who live and work on and around the waterways.” Overall, the exhibition at the London Canal Museum is a real treat for anyone who is interested in photography or who wants to learn more about the history and culture of the Warwickshire region. The Longdens Collection offers a rare glimpse into the past and reminds us of the beauty and simplicity of life in the early post-war years.
