article: (CNN) -- An Atlanta, Georgia, judge who ordered white lawyers out of his courtroom so he could lecture African-American defendants called that decision a "mistake" Tuesday night. Judge Marvin Arrington says he is fed up with the defendants he keeps seeing in his courtroom. "In retrospect, it was a mistake," Judge Marvin Arrington told CNN. "Because my sheriff said to me, 'Judge, that message should be given to everybody' -- 'Don't violate the law, make something out of yourself, go to school, find a role model, somebody that will help you advance your life.'" Arrington, who is African-American, is a judge in Fulton County, Georgia, which includes the city of Atlanta. He said he got fed up seeing a parade of young black defendants shuffle into his courtroom and decided to address them one day last week -- out of the earshot of white lawyers. "I came out and saw the defendants, and it was about 99.9 percent Afro-Americans," Arrington told CNN affiliate WSB-TV of Atlanta, "and at some point in time, I excused some lawyers -- most of them white -- and said to the young people in here, 'What in the world are you doing with your lives?'" The judge thought his message would make a greater impact if he delivered it to a black-only audience, he said.  Watch judge talk about decision to lecture black defendants Â» . "I didn't want them to think I was talking down to them; trying to embarrass them or insult them; be derogatory toward them, and I was just saying, 'Please get yourself together,'" Arrington said. In his Tuesday night appearance on CNN, Arrington told Anderson Cooper that that seeing the same faces walk in and out of his courtroom year after year takes its toll. "I ask them all the the time, 'What progress are we making with you?' And sometime they cannot answer," he said. He said he would open his court doors to everyone on Thursday and "I am going to give the same identical speech: 'You've got to do better.'" E-mail to a friend .

chatgpt: Judge Marvin Arrington, renowned for his advocacy for justice and equality in Atlanta, has recently expressed deep regret over a decision he made more than 30 years ago. During his time as a judge in Fulton County Superior Court, Arrington ordered the removal of all white attorneys from his courtroom for an afternoon. The reason for this decision was to have a conversation with black defendants in his courtroom, especially those who were young and facing severe criminal allegations. Arrington intended to share his wisdom and experience with these defendants and urge them to get their lives together. However, over time, Arrington realized that his decision to remove white attorneys from his courtroom was not the right thing to do. It communicated the wrong message, and it went against the ideals of inclusivity that the judge always espoused. In an interview, Judge Arrington stated that he acknowledges the error in judgment that he committed in his youth. He noted that the real issue was his desire to connect with black defendants, and it had nothing to do with the skin color of the lawyers present in his courtroom.  Thus, to make amends, Arrington has decided to open his court to everyone on Thursday and deliver the same speech. This time, the judge is determined to get his message across while also recognizing the need to promote diversity and inclusivity in the justice system.  "It took me a long time to understand that the color of skin doesn't matter. We all need someone to help us," Judge Arrington said. "I hope that by opening up my courtroom and including everyone, I can promote the idea that we are all equal and deserve a chance to have our voices heard." The decision by Judge Arrington is one that has been widely lauded across the legal community. It highlights the need for judges and other legal figures to promote diversity and inclusivity in the courtrooms. This is particularly important for young defendants, who need guidance and support from everyone regardless of their skin color. In conclusion, Judge Arrington's decision to open his courtroom to everyone is a significant step towards promoting diversity and inclusivity in the justice system. It shows that even when we make mistakes, we can take steps towards making things right and promoting equality.
