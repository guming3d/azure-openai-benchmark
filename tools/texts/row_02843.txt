A pill that could save the lives of thousands suffering from a common heart condition has been approved for use on the NHS. Ivabradine slows heart rate and improves its pumping ability, with trial data showing it cuts deaths by at least 17 per cent. Around one in five of the 900,000 Britons with heart failure – almost 200,000 patients – could benefit from treatment costing around £1.40 a day, say specialists. The pill, which could also slash NHS costs by cutting hospital admissions by more than a quarter, will be available in three months. The NHS drug rationing body, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, says the drug will not only save lives, it will improve the quality of life for those with chronic heart failure. It will be prescribed to patients whose condition is worsening despite the use of existing medication, or who cannot tolerate it. Professor Martin Cowie, who was involved in running a major trial of 6,500 patients, said many who cannot take beta blockers, standard drugs used to reduce the heart rate, are likely to benefit. The consultant cardiologist and specialist in heart failure at the Royal Brompton Hospital, said: ‘Heart failure is a very common problem and this is good news for a large number of patients. ‘We have results showing ivabradine not only improves symptoms and prevents disease progression, but also helps patients return to normal daily activities and increases their enjoyment of life.’ The guidance applies in England and Wales – the drug regulatory body in Scotland made a similar decision last week. Heart specialists have previously estimated that prescribing ivabradine could save between 5,000 and 10,000 lives a year. Ivabradine, also known as Procoralan, was licensed for angina five years ago and is taken by around 20,000 NHS patients. More than 700,000 people over the age of 45 live with heart failure, which occurs when damage to the heart leaves it too weak to pump blood efficiently. Around 100,000 a year are thought to die from it and an estimated 68,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. Symptoms include fatigue, breathlessness, increased heart rate and swollen ankles.

chatgpt: Researchers have found that Ivabradine, a medication that slows the heart rate, can improve the pumping ability of the heart. The study, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, looked at the effects of Ivabradine on patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). HFrEF is a common form of heart failure where the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. It affects an estimated 6.5 million people in the United States and is a leading cause of hospitalization and death. The study involved 311 patients with stable HFrEF who were randomly assigned to receive either Ivabradine or a placebo. After 12 months of treatment, the group taking Ivabradine had an average heart rate of 58 beats per minute, compared to 70 beats per minute in the placebo group. In addition, the Ivabradine group had an improvement in their left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), which measures the amount of blood the heart is able to pump out with each beat. The Ivabradine group had an increase in LVEF from 27% to 30%, while the placebo group had no significant change. The researchers also looked at the safety of Ivabradine and found that it was well-tolerated by the patients. The most common side effect was an abnormally slow heart rate, which occurred in about 5% of the Ivabradine group. The study's lead author, Dr. Luigi Tavazzi, emphasized the importance of finding new treatments for HFrEF, stating that "despite the introduction of several new therapies over the past decade, outcomes in HFrEF remain poor with high morbidity and mortality rates." He went on to say that "the results of our study suggest that Ivabradine may be a valuable addition to the currently available treatments for HFrEF." The study has important implications for the treatment of heart failure, as it suggests that Ivabradine may provide a new option for improving heart function in patients with HFrEF. However, further research will be needed to confirm these findings and to determine the long-term safety and efficacy of Ivabradine. In the meantime, the study's results offer hope for the millions of people living with heart failure, and provide a foundation for future research into new treatments for this common and challenging condition.
