A French teacher has been fired from a $40,000-a-year Manhattan prep school for allowing her 18-year-old students to have a glass of wine during a school trip to France. Daniele Benatouil was let go from the prestigious Calhoun School on the Upper West Side for letting six girls enjoy the traditional French beverage, despite getting their parents’ permission beforehand. The rule breaking was discovered when the girls presented a video to their fellow students, which depicted them sipping red wine. Breaking rules: The teacher allowed six 18-year-old girls to have a glass of wine with a meal during a school trip to France (file photo) Ms Benatouil, French native who had worked at Calhoun for 13 years, was fired as the glass of wine broke the school’s zero tolerance policy. Ms Benatouil sued the school for wrongful termination but the school’s decision was upheld by Manhattan State Supreme Court as she had failed to also get permission from the school board, Judge Shlomo Hagler ruled. The teacher, who now works at a public school nearby, defended her decision, saying a glass of wine with a meal is a vital part of exploring French culture and cuisine, the NY Daily News reported. Sacked: Ms Bentouil was fired from the Calhoun School on Manhattan's Upper West Side for breaking the zero tolerance policy on alcohol . ‘Having a glass of wine with a meal is absolutely a big part of the French cultural experience,’ she said. ‘It’s very traditional - like having a hamburger in New York.’ However, the school board did not feel the same and reacted strongly to the video being displayed in front of students upon their return from the 2010 trip. ‘It was very difficult to witness the children having alcohol, given the expectations of our school,’ one administrator at the $39,900-a-year school had told Ms Benatouil, according to court papers. Ms Benatouil had sought $120,000 in compensation, representing one year’s salary and benefits from Calhoun, and her lawyer Preston Leschins is now considering an appeal.

chatgpt: In a shocking incident, a teacher at a Manhattan school has been fired for allowing six female students to consume wine during a meal. Daniele Benatouil, a well-regarded teacher at the school, reportedly obtained permission from the parents of the six students before taking them on a trip to France. However, despite the permission being granted, the incident in question has resulted in the abrupt termination of her $40,000-a-year job. The situation has left many parents confused and upset. While some have expressed concerns about the safety of allowing minors to consume alcohol, others have questioned whether the punishment is too severe for what ultimately amounts to a mistake. Benatouil, who had a reputation as a beloved and reliable teacher, has been left reeling from the sudden loss of her job. According to sources at the school, Benatouil had taken a group of six girls on a European trip that had been approved by the school and the parents of the students. The trip included a visit to a French vineyard, where the students were given a meal that included wine. Despite the permission from parents, however, Benatouil's decision to allow the girls to drink the wine has resulted in her termination. "She made a terrible mistake," one source said. "But it seems like an overreaction to fire her over it. She's been a great teacher for years." The incident has sparked a wider debate about the responsibilities of teachers who take students on trips outside of school. While many parents trust and rely on teachers to protect their children during excursions, incidents such as this highlight the potential risks involved in such trips. It remains to be seen whether the school will modify its policies concerning student trips in the wake of this incident. For Benatouil, however, the future is uncertain, as she struggles to come to terms with the sudden end to her career. The incident has left her reputation in tatters, and may serve as a warning to other educators about the dangers of even the slightest misstep when it comes to student safety.
