article: London, England (CNN) -- A solar-powered aircraft, which a team hopes will one day circle the globe, completed a 26-hour test flight in Switzerland at 9 a.m. (3 a.m. ET) Thursday. Solar Impulse took off shortly before 7 a.m. Wednesday from an airfield in Payerne, 80 miles northeast of Geneva. The plane was piloted by Andre Borschberg, who flew to a height of nearly 28,000 feet (8,500 meters). "I've been a pilot for 40 years now, but this flight has been the most incredible one of my flying career," Borschberg said, according to the New York Times. "Just sitting there and watching the battery charge level rise and rise thanks to the sun. I have just flown more than 26 hours without using a drop of fuel and without causing any pollution." During the evening, the plane slowly descended to an altitude of 4,500 feet (1,500 meters), where it remained for the rest of the night using battery power. An hour before dawn, the plane still had six hours of flying time left in its solar-fueled batteries. Solar Impulse has a wingspan of more than 206 feet (63 meters) -- the same as an Airbus A340 -- and is nearly 72 feet (22 meters) long. It weighs about 3,500 pounds (1,600 kilograms) and has nearly 12,000 solar cells attached to its wings and horizontal stabilizers. The plane is equipped with four electric engines and has a top speed of about 43 miles (70 kilometers) per hour. "The goal of the project is to have a solar-powered plane flying day and night without fuel," said the co-founder of the project, Bertrand Piccard. The Swiss adventurer, who piloted the first nonstop balloon flight around the world in 1999 in the Breitling Orbiter III, said the test flight was "crucial for the credibility of the project." The challenge to fly a solar plane around the world was announced in 2003. With the success of the test flight, a second airplane will be designed to fly much farther next year, with the aim of flying across continents and the Atlantic Ocean. In 2012, the team hopes to fly Solar Impulse around the world in five stages.

chatgpt: A solar-powered plane known as "Solar Impulse" has successfully completed a 26-hour test flight over Switzerland. The project was co-founded by Swiss balloonist Bertrand Piccard, who celebrated the achievement on social media. The Solar Impulse is a unique aircraft powered only by the sun's energy. It has nearly 12,000 separate solar cells built into its wings, which collect energy during the day and can store it for use at night. This technology allowed the plane to fly through the night, marking a major breakthrough for solar energy in aviation. The test flight began early in the morning and lasted just over a day, during which the plane flew at an average altitude of 3,000 meters. The team behind the Solar Impulse project noted that the plane performed well throughout the flight, and that the results were promising for the future of solar-powered aviation. Many experts in the field of renewable energy were thrilled with the success of the Solar Impulse test flight. Dr. Peter Harrop, Chairman of IDTechEx, a UK-based research company, commented on the achievement, saying, "This is the first real-world proof that solar energy can power an aircraft. It is a major step forward in renewable energy research and development." Bertrand Piccard, who co-founded the Solar Impulse project, was also pleased with the results of the test flight. On social media, he expressed his gratitude for the team that helped make the flight possible, and said that the project was a reminder of the importance of innovation and sustainability. The Solar Impulse project has been a long-term endeavor, with the team working on the technology for several years. The successful test flight was a major milestone for the project, which aims to prove that solar energy can be a viable alternative to traditional jet fuel. Although the Solar Impulse is not capable of carrying passengers, the technology used in the plane could pave the way for future developments in solar-powered aviation. The team behind the project hopes that the successful test flight will encourage others to invest in renewable energy research and support the transition to a more sustainable future. Overall, the Solar Impulse test flight was a major achievement in the field of renewable energy. With nearly 12,000 solar cells powering the plane, the project demonstrated the potential for solar energy to change the way we travel in the future.
