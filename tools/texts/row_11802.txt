The iconic archery shot has been re-produced in various Robin Hood films over the years - archer Howard Hill reportedly managed to split a target-embedded arrow with his own while he was working as a stunt archer for the The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) which starred Errol Flynn. But when it was carried out in the 1991 film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, starring Kevin Costner, it was the use of special effects which saw the camera seemingly follow the arrow through the air.

In 2008 a British blind grandmother pulled off the shot at a practice session of the Wellington Bowmen in Somerset. Tilly Trotter, 74, told The Daily Telegraph: 'The second arrow made such a noise going into the back of previous arrow I thought I had hit the ceiling or done some expensive damage. 'Then I heard people jumping up and down shouting that I'd done a Robin Hood. 'It was a one-in-a-million shot and a bit of a fluke really.' Peter Jones, a spokesman for the Grand National Archery Society, said: 'It's a very rare feat - like getting two holes in one on the same round of golf.'
