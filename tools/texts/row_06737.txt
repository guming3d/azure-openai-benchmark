article: (CNN) -- Russia began to cut off natural gas supplies to Belarus on Monday as talks over unpaid debts continued, Russian state media reported. President Dmitry Medvedev gave the order for Russian energy giant Gazprom to start restricting gas supplies, company CEO Alexei Miller said, according to official Russian news agency RIA-Novosti. Miller said the cut, which began Monday, will be "gradual, daily and proportional to the volume of debt." Belarus has refused to pay Russian gas rates of $169 per 1,000 cubic meters for the first quarter of the year and $185 for the second quarter, RIA-Novosti reported.  The former Soviet republic has instead been paying $150 since Jan. 1, ringing up a large debt in the process. Russia's action could hurt customers farther down the pipeline. Belarus has said it will be technologically unable to ensure complete natural gas transit to Europe, if Russia cuts gas supplies to Belarus by 85 percent, state media reported. In the past, other countries including Austria, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Romania, Greece and Turkey have complained that their gas supplies have been affected as Russia trimmed output to upstream customers like Belarus and Ukraine. Gazprom is the world's biggest producer and exporter of natural gas -- and Russia's most powerful company. It controls 20 percent of the world's natural gas reserves and operates the world's largest gas distribution network covering an area from Europe to the Far East, according to its website. Gazprom exports energy to 32 countries and provides around 25 percent of the European Union's gas supplies. Formed in 1989 to replace the Soviet Ministry of the Gas Industry, Gazprom is closely tied to the Russian government, which owns a controlling 50 percent stake in the company.  Medvedev is a former Gazprom chairman. In recent years, an increasingly confident Moscow has used Gazprom to assert its authority over Russia's former sphere of influence by offering heavily subsidized gas to ex-Soviet countries. But that policy has led to disputes as Gazprom has then sought to raise prices. Gazprom has switched off gas supplies to another former republic -- Ukraine -- several times in recent years in a row over payments and Kiev's rejection of proposals to hike rates.  Those disputes ended earlier this year when Russia agreed to a 30 percent drop in the price of natural gas sold to Ukraine, in exchange for permission to extend Russia's lease of a major naval base in the Black Sea port of Sevastopol, Ukraine, for 25 years.

chatgpt: Belarus has announced that it is unable to guarantee the transit of natural gas to Europe. The announcement comes amidst talks aimed at resolving debts owed by Belarus to Russia. Belarus has been facing a severe financial crisis, and its debt to Russia for imported gas has been steadily increasing. The country is now struggling to meet its financial obligations, and the tension between Russia and Belarus has increased as a result. Gazprom, the world's largest natural gas distribution network, operates the pipeline that delivers Russian gas to Europe via Belarus. The company has warned that it will gradually cut off gas supplies to Belarus if it fails to pay its debts. Belarus, in turn, has warned that it cannot guarantee the transit of gas to Europe without Russian gas supplies. This could lead to a significant impact on the European countries that rely on the gas pipeline that runs through Belarus. The situation has continued to escalate, with Russia accusing Belarus of siphoning off gas intended for Europe, a charge that Belarus has denied. The Belarusian authorities have argued that the pipeline is old and prone to leaks, which leads to gas losses. The European Union has been monitoring the situation closely, with concerns growing over the potential impact of a disruption to the gas supply. The EU relies heavily on Russian gas, with about 40% of its gas imports coming from Russia. Despite the tensions, talks between Belarus and Russia have continued, with both sides expressing a desire to resolve the issue. However, it remains unclear how this will be achieved, given the financial difficulties facing Belarus. Meanwhile, the impact of the dispute is being felt across Europe, with concerns growing over the potential for gas shortages. The gradual cuts in gas supplies by Gazprom are expected to have a significant impact on the supply of gas to European countries, particularly those in Eastern Europe. As the situation continues to evolve, there are concerns that it could lead to a broader geopolitical rift between Russia and Europe. The EU has already imposed sanctions on Russia over its annexation of Crimea, and any escalation in tensions over gas supplies could further complicate the relationship between the two sides. In the coming days and weeks, it will be essential to watch the situation closely, particularly as the winter approaches, and demand for gas increases. The situation remains fluid, with both sides continuing to negotiate over the outstanding debts, and the transit of gas to Europe hangs in the balance.
