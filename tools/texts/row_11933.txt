article: (CNN) -- More and more mothers, clutching their rail-thin, malnourished children, are arriving at the packed waiting rooms of the Doctor Without Borders clinics in central Somalia, the aid group said. In fact, the group said it is treating 1,300 children in north and south Galcayo, which is almost half the number of children treated for malnutrition in the area all of last year. "The situation is alarming," said Karin Fischer Liddle, head of the organization's mission in Somalia. "Our staff is stretched. This is the highest number of malnourished children MSF has ever treated in the area." Doctors Without Borders -- widely known by its French name, Medecins Sans Frontieres -- said the brutal mix of a lengthy drought, high food prices and insecurity from violence has caused a spike in malnutrition cases. Rain has come to the area in recent weeks, Fischer Liddle said, but it has caused more children to fall ill, leading to more malnutrition cases. In the long run, the rains may help the organization's overburdened clinics in the area. "Hopefully, the rains all over Somalia will cause food prices to drop and help some of these families," Fischer Liddle said. She talked about a woman named Ubah who is at one of the nutrition centers that operate in hospitals in Galcayo. The woman went to the nutrition center after her daughter contracted measles, lost her sight and was unconscious for a week. After more two weeks, Ubah said, she saw improvement in her daughter, though she had not regained her sight. "They gave her fluid, vitamins and therapeutic food. Now her body is better, unlike when I first brought her here. Now she looks more like other babies," Ubah said.

chatgpt: A group in Galcayo, Somalia, is treating more than 1,300 malnourished children, according to the latest reports. The dire situation is linked to the ongoing drought and conflict that have plagued the region in recent years. However, officials are hopeful that the current rainy season could bring relief by bringing down food prices. The group, which has been working tirelessly to provide aid and medical care to those in need, has managed to treat a significant number of malnourished children. Among them is a young girl who reportedly lost her sight due to complications from the measles. Her mother credits the food provided by the group for helping her daughter's condition improve. Despite the group's best efforts, the situation in Galcayo remains dire. Many families are struggling to provide even basic necessities for their children, including food and clean water. The ongoing conflict in the region has only exacerbated the situation, leaving many displaced and without access to essential services. Officials are hopeful that the current rainy season could bring some relief to the crisis. If the rain does come as anticipated, it could help to bring down food prices and ease the burden on families who are struggling to make ends meet. However, the situation remains precarious, and much will depend on the extent and duration of the rainfall. For now, the group in Galcayo continues to provide aid and medical care to those in need. Their efforts are crucial in helping to alleviate the suffering of the most vulnerable members of the community. However, much more needs to be done to address the root causes of the crisis, including the ongoing conflict and lack of access to basic services.
