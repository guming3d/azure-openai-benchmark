article: (CNN) -- A big Bertha could have really clubbed Puerto Rico, but fortunately for the denizens of that U.S. territory, Tropical Storm Bertha never gained much clout. The tropical storm dumped plenty of rain and forged through the Caribbean island with gale-force winds Saturday afternoon, but according to the National Hurricane Center, Bertha barely qualified as a tropical cyclone, with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph, as dry air and vertical shear tore the storm apart. Despite the lack of an impressive resume, Bertha made things miserable for at least tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans. Nearly 40,000 people, mostly in the mountainous center of Puerto Rico, lost electricity, and another 3,000 were left without fresh water, Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla said at a news conference. Padilla also said 220 "refugees," from several different countries, including the United States, ended up in shelters in Arroyo, Cayey and Ponce. The storm was heading over the eastern Dominican Republic, which was subject to a tropical storm warning, according the National Hurricane Center's 8 p.m. advisory. The Miami-based center noted that Bertha was centered about 60 miles east-northeast of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, and 200 miles southeast of Grand Turk Island. As of 8 p.m. tropical storm warnings also remained in effect for the southeastern Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos Islands. Bertha could end up dumping 1 to 3 inches of rain "with isolated amounts up to 5 inches" throughout the Caribbean by the time it's passed through. The Hurricane Center suggests three possible scenarios for Bertha. The official forecast is that "Bertha survives its current lack of structure, land interaction, and dry air entrainment long enough to reach a more favorable environment in about 36 hours. At that point, it would likely intensify until the onset of extratropical transition in 96-120 hours," and become a hurricane far out in the Atlantic Ocean. The second scenario calls for Bertha to degenerate over Hispaniola, though it could regenerate later. And the third scenario would involve a low pressure system developing over the northwestern Bahamas absorbing Bertha in the next 48 hours or so. The biggest threat to the United States would be rip currents up and down the East Coast as large waves come ashore. Share your photos, videos and stories with CNN iReport .

chatgpt: The tropical storm Bertha continues to linger in the Caribbean, maintaining its strength with 45 mph winds. As of Thursday morning, the storm was centered about 60 miles from Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic. Bertha has already caused significant disruption in the region, leaving nearly 40,000 people without power in Puerto Rico. The storm also brought heavy rainfall and gusty winds to the island, causing flooding in some areas. Despite the storm's proximity to the United States, officials say that Bertha is not expected to make landfall on the continent. The National Hurricane Center has issued a tropical storm warning for a portion of the Dominican Republic, but no watches or warnings are currently in effect for the U.S. Bertha is the second named storm of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, which officially began on June 1. While the season is expected to be an active one, with up to 19 named storms forecast, it is still early in the year and many of the strongest storms typically occur later in the season. As Bertha moves away from Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, officials are urging residents in other parts of the region to remain vigilant. Heavy rainfall and localized flooding could still impact parts of the Caribbean over the coming days. In the United States, emergency management officials are also monitoring the storm closely. While Bertha is not expected to threaten the U.S., authorities say it serves as a reminder to residents of hurricane-prone states to be prepared and have a plan in place in case a storm does strike. The coronavirus pandemic has added an additional layer of complexity to hurricane preparedness this year. Emergency management officials are urging residents to have personal protective equipment such as masks and hand sanitizer on hand in addition to the usual hurricane supplies. As Bertha continues to churn in the Caribbean, residents and officials alike are keeping a close eye on the storm's path and potential impacts. While the storm may not pose a direct threat to the United States, its effects are still being felt in the region and serve as a reminder of the need for preparedness during hurricane season.
