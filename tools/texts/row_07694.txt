article: The Austrian government is looking at ways to expropriate the house where Adolf Hitler spent his early childhood as it seeks to end a dispute with the owner over its use. The move is the latest in efforts by the government to ensure that the house, in Beaunau, is not used in a way that makes it even more of a shrine for Hitler's admirers. The government has already made an offer to buy the house from the owner. Municipal officials in Braunau have already complained that it draws neo-Nazi visitors to the town on the border with Germany. Scroll down for video .

Municipal officials in Braunau have already complained that it draws neo-Nazi visitors to the town on the border with Germany; the interior ministry has rented the house for years to prevent misuse, but it has remained empty for three years after the last tenants moved out . Interior ministry spokesman Karl-Heinz Grundboeck said his ministry expects expert opinions by the end of the month on expropriation if the owner - a woman authorities refuse to identify - turns down their offer to purchase it. The interior ministry has rented the house for years to prevent its misuse, subletting it to various charitable organisations. But the building has stood empty since a workshop for the mentally disabled moved out more than three years ago. Local officials say the owner vetoed plans to move in a new charity and a school late last year because she was opposed to renovations that would be required. Interior ministry spokesman Karl-Heinz Grundboeck, pictured, said his ministry expects expert opinions by the end of the month on expropriation if the owner if Hitler's childhood home - a woman authorities refuse to identify - turns down a government offer to buy it . Alderman Harry Buchmayer said officials had 'tried very hard' to find a solution but the owner 'does not seem ready to co-operate'. Mr Grundboeck described expropriation as the 'last option', saying the government hoped the owner would agree to sell. She has reportedly turned down past offers. Among prospective buyers over the past few years was a Russian parliamentarian who threatened to raze it - a plan doomed to fail as the Renaissance-era building is under historical protection.

chatgpt: The Austrian government has been renting Adolf Hitler's childhood home in the town of Braunau since 1972. The building has been sublet to charities to prevent any potential misuse, but in recent years, it has remained empty due to the owner's vetoing of tenants. The controversial site has already attracted neo-Nazi visitors to the town, and officials fear that it poses a potential danger. The government has been facing growing pressure to take action against the property's owner, who has continued to block potential tenants over the years. Now, Austrian officials have announced that they are planning on buying or expropriating the property to ensure that it does not fall into the wrong hands. The decision to take ownership of the property has not been taken lightly. The government's previous attempts to lease the building to community groups have been met with opposition from residents who fear that the building could turn into a shrine for followers of Hitler's ideology. Moreover, neo-Nazi groups have attempted to stage rallies near the property in the past, further fueling concerns of potential danger. Officials have said that they will take all necessary measures to ensure that the building does not attract any more far-right extremists. The government plans to use the property for educational and cultural purposes, possibly even turning it into a museum to educate the public about the dangers of extremist ideologies. For the people of Braunau, this decision has been a long time coming. The town has been grappling with the issue for years, with many worried that the building's notoriety could damage the reputation of the town as a whole. The purchase of the property will allow the town to move on from this dark period in its history and prevent the building from becoming a beacon for neo-Nazi groups. There are still some who oppose the government's plan to take over the property. Some view it as an infringement of property rights, while others believe the property should be destroyed altogether. However, officials believe that this is the best course of action to ensure that the building does not become a symbol of hate and division. Taking control of the property is just the first step in a long process to ensure that history does not repeat itself. The government's commitment to educating the public about the dangers of extremist ideology is a crucial component of this effort. By turning this symbol of hate into one of education and remembrance, the government hopes to ensure that the horrors of the past will never be repeated.
