The Ringo app attempts to rival this by offering calls between countries for the same price as local calls - using submarine cables. This means the app bypasses expensive carrier call costs, doesn’t ask people to turn on roaming data and the firm claims is typically 25 per cent cheaper than Skype. Scroll down for video .

chatgpt: A new mobile app has been launched called Ringo that allows users to make international calls without the need for an internet connection. Ringo is available for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone in 16 countries across the globe. Using local phone networks, Ringo converts international calls into local ones, which then get routed through submarine cables to their final destination. According to the developers of Ringo, this technology makes international calls up to 25% cheaper compared to other services, including Skype. The cost of international calls can often be prohibitively expensive for those who need to keep in touch with loved ones or do business with individuals in other countries. But with Ringo, this problem has been solved. The way Ringo works is relatively simple. When a user makes an international call, Ringo uses local phone networks to dial a local number. This local number is then forwarded to a Ringo server that's located in the country of the person being called. The server then connects the call to the recipient's phone using submarine cables. This method allows Ringo to bypass the high costs associated with traditional international calling. Instead of paying expensive long-distance fees, users pay for a local call. This is especially useful for those in developing countries who might not have access to high-speed internet connections or who might not be able to afford the high costs of traditional international calling. Ringo is currently available in 16 countries, including the US, Canada, Australia, the UK, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland. It's also available in select countries in Asia, including Japan and Singapore. The developers of Ringo are quick to point out that their app does not require an internet connection to make international calls. This sets Ringo apart from other similar services, like WhatsApp and Skype, that rely on internet connections to function. One potential drawback of Ringo is that it requires both the caller and the recipient to have the app installed on their phone. However, this isn't necessarily a deal-breaker, as it's free to download and use. Additionally, the cost savings associated with using Ringo could make it an attractive option for those who frequently make international calls. Overall, Ringo represents an innovative solution to the problem of expensive international calling. By using local phone networks and submarine cables to route calls, Ringo allows users to make international calls at a fraction of the cost of other services. With Ringo available in 16 countries and counting, it's an app that's definitely worth checking out for anyone who needs to make international calls on a regular basis.
