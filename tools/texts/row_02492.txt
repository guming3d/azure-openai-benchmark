article: These pictures prove that it is not only humans that enjoy a rich and varied diet. Hidden cameras captured these remarkable images among the treetops of sea eagles dining on lamb, rabbit, fish and even a gosling. As part of the Forestry Commission project nearly 7,000 covert images were taken of the nest in Argyll on the west coast of Scotland during the 2014 breeding season. Despite their name, the birds of prey feasted on only seven fish during the seven month period, but brought back a total of nine lambs  for dinner. Dinner time: A pair of sea eagles enjoy a fish super in their treetop nest . The hidden camera captured the sea eagles eating a tiny baby gosling . During the 2014 breeding season the birds of prey were captured dining on nine lambs . The sea eagles brought 117 prey items back to the nest between January and July. The images were captured by a hidden camera installed among the trees as part of a Forestry Commission project . After looking at thousands of photographs it was confirmed that the sea eagles returned to their nest with 117 prey items between January and July. Analysis confirmed that 67 items were unidentifiable, 21 were mammals, 14 were birds, seven were fish, and  up to nine were lambs. The Scottish sea eagles were close to extinction in the late 19th and early 20th century, but following a reintroduction programme in 1975 there are now thought to be more than 80 breeding pairs. The research appears to confirm farmers' concerns about the extent to which sea eagles are preying on lambs. In 2008 farmers on the Gairloch peninsula, in the Scottish Highlands, claimed 200 lambs were taken in just one season. But conservationists have insisted sea eagles preying in lambs in a rare occurrence. The findings were revealed at the first meeting of the sea eagle stakeholder group, which was set up after repeated complaints about the birds from farmers. Lachie Maclean, interim chair of the group, said: 'This is a useful piece of research which will help feed into the wider discussions about managing sea eagles in our area. 'The survey gives us a better idea of when lambs are more likely to be part of sea eagles' diets.' The hidden cameras were disguised under a piece of pre-prepared bark and rubbed with mud. A spokesman for the Forestry Commission Scotland, which led the undercover camera project, said he believed it was the first time images like these have ever been taken in Scotland.

chatgpt: The Forestry Commission has recently captured over 7,000 images of sea eagles in their nest in Argyll using covert recording equipment. The footage provides a remarkable insight into the breeding habits of these amazing birds, which are thought to have been extinct in the UK until they were reintroduced in the 1970s. Sea eagles have become increasingly common in Scotland over the past few decades, with an estimated 80 breeding pairs in the west. Despite their epic reputation and majestic appearance, sea eagles have sometimes come into conflict with local farmers, who worry about the toll the birds can take on their livestock. The Forestry Commission installed the hidden camera in order to better understand the feeding habits of the sea eagles in Argyll, and the results were certainly revealing. During the 2014 breeding season, the birds of prey ate a total of nine lambs, which has understandably raised concerns among local farmers. However, the sea eagles' diet was not solely made up of livestock. In fact, the cameras captured a wide array of prey, including rabbits, fish, and even a gosling. This shows that they are not solely dependent on the lambs they occasionally prey upon, and further research could help to mitigate any conflict between the eagles and farmers. Sea eagles are truly remarkable birds of prey, with wingspans that can reach up to eight feet. They are a protected species under British law, and their reintroduction to Scotland is seen as a major conservation success story. The footage captured by the Forestry Commission is not only fascinating, but could provide important insights into how these majestic creatures live and thrive in the wild. The cameras used to capture the footage were properly vetted and installed, with utmost care given to ensure that the sea eagles were not disturbed. The Forestry Commission has assured that they will continue to monitor the sea eagles in Argyll and work with local farmers to minimize any conflict. The stunning footage captured by the Forestry Commission will likely be of interest to researchers, wildlife enthusiasts and the general public alike. The sea eagles are truly awe-inspiring creatures, and the footage captures their majesty in a way that few have ever seen before. It is hoped that further work will be done to ensure that these birds continue to thrive and become a symbol of Scotland's natural beauty for generations to come.
