'Our main goal is to increase the involvement of men and boys in the struggle to achieve gender equality,' said head of UN Women Phumzile Mlambo Ngcuka. 'It cannot be that women will do this alone,' she said. 'It remains an important women's issue that requires the whole of society, men and women, to be involved.' Mlambo Ngcuka, who announced the 'HeForShe' campaign in March, called on the world's fathers, sons, husbands and brothers to stand up and support equality for women in all areas of life. The Inter-Parliamentary Union says less that 22 percent of parliamentarians are women. There are also still 100 countries with laws that prevent women's meaningful involvement in the economy, Mlambo Ngcuka said. She said projections indicate that if things don't change it will take 95 years to achieve gender equality, and by 2020 and some 140,000 girls will be forced into child marriage. UN Women said supporters of the HeForShe campaign include actors Matt Damon, Patrick Stewart, Antonio Banderas and Kiefer Sutherland, and South African Nobel peace laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu.

chatgpt: Emma Watson attended the United Nations Women's HeForShe campaign launch on Tuesday and called for men to play a greater role in ending gender inequality worldwide. The actress delivered a powerful speech on the importance of gender equality, saying that “we are struggling for a uniting word but the good news is we have a uniting movement.”  During her speech, Watson also revealed her own experiences of gender-based discrimination. She said that as a child, she was branded "bossy" for wanting to direct school plays, while her male counterparts were praised for their leadership skills. This experience led her to question why women were often labeled negatively for displaying the same behavior that men were lauded for. Watson also discussed the problem of body image and how it affects young women. She revealed that some of her friends dropped out of sports as they didn't want to be muscly, which she said demonstrated the toxic messages that society sends to young girls. "I was lucky because I found a sport I loved and I never doubted that I belonged there, but many girls aren't that lucky," she said. The "HeForShe" campaign, which Watson is a UN Women Goodwill Ambassador for, aims to promote gender equality by encouraging men to take an active role in ending discrimination against women globally. The campaign has been widely praised for its approach, which recognizes that gender inequality affects both men and women and that men have an important role to play in ending it. Watson called on men to use their privilege and power to help women gain equality, saying that "men, I would like to take this opportunity to extend your formal invitation. Gender equality is your issue, too." She said that men needed to become feminists and speak out against sexism and gender-based discrimination. The actress also addressed criticisms of the campaign, which some have accused of being too focused on men at the expense of women's issues. Watson argued that men had a crucial role to play in ending gender inequality and that the campaign was not about taking away from women but rather encouraging everyone to work together towards a common goal. The "HeForShe" campaign has already attracted support from a number of high-profile names, including former US President Barack Obama, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and actor Matt Damon. It has also sparked a wider conversation about the importance of gender equality and the role that men can play in promoting it. Watson's powerful speech was widely praised on social media, with many people thanking her for her continued work as a campaigner for gender equality. One Twitter user wrote, "Emma Watson's speech at the UN shows why we need more women in leadership roles. She is articulate, passionate and inspiring." Overall, Watson's appearance at the HeForShe campaign launch served as a reminder of the vital work that needs to be done to achieve gender equality and the important role that men can play in this process.
