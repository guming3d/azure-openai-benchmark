The child is now in a stable condition at a hospital in China's southern Guangdong province four days after the surgery. The 13-day-old boy, from Huizhou, was born joined to a headless parasitic twin joined at the torso on April 2. That has now been removed. Doctors at a hospital in Huizhou city, in China's Guangdong province, released this picture of the baby with four hands and four feet before surgery . Yu Jiakang, chief surgeon at Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center said: 'They were supposed to be twins, but one had underdeveloped and became deformed.' The conjoined twins weighed just over 3kg before surgery, with the removed parasitic foetus weighing 0.6kg. According to the Global Times, the . baby was diagnosed with pneumonia and congenital heart . disease, which is common among children in China, before surgery. His father, named only as Mr Chen, said he had . taken his son to many hospitals near his home but none have been able to give him . reasons for the deformity.

Conjoined . twins form when a split egg fails to fully separate. A ‘parasite’ conjoined twin can survive but not when one absorbs the other. In 2012 surgeons in Peru operated on a three year old boy to remove a 9in-long parasitic twin weighing a pound and a half. In 2008 doctors had to remove a 2in embryo from the body of a nine-year-old girl in Greece. The . brain, lungs and heart are some of the last parts of the body to . develop. Removing a parasitic twin is usually easier than attempting to . separate conjoined twins. Mr Chen said he blamed himself for not taking good care of his wife and son during pregnancy. 'I only cared about my work. I just thought of making money instead of taking her to hospital for a medical checkup.' In August last year it was revealed an eight-month-old baby who grew a second 'head' had undergone surgery to have it removed. Doctors in India said the second head was a 'parasitic twin', weighed almost a kilo and had brain tissue within it. The child, known as Tofajjal, was suffering from a rare disease called encephalomeningocele, said to affect one in 40,000 to 45,000 . babies. A similar case happened with a baby in Pakistan two years ago. A doctor at the National Institute of Child Health in Karachi said that the abnormal birth was the result of a genetic disease which affects only one in a million or so babies.

chatgpt: A 13-day-old baby boy born in Guangdong province, China, is currently in stable condition after undergoing a life-saving surgery to remove his headless parasitic twin. The surgery was successfully performed by doctors at Guangdong's Maternal and Child Healthcare Hospital, who reported that the baby and his parasitic twin weighed just over 3 kilograms before the procedure. The rare medical condition, known as craniopagus parasiticus, occurs when one twin fails to develop fully in the womb and becomes parasitic to the other twin. In this case, the 13-day-old boy was born with a fully-formed, headless twin attached to him, which posed an extreme danger to his vital organs. The team of doctors quickly assessed the baby's condition and decided that emergency surgery was necessary to remove the parasitic twin. The surgery was conducted under local anesthesia, and doctors were able to remove the parasitic twin without damaging any vital organs. Following the surgery, the baby boy was placed in the neonatal intensive care unit, where he is currently recovering. Doctors say he is in stable condition and are closely monitoring his progress. Considering the complexities of the surgery and the baby's young age, his recovery is being closely monitored by doctors. This rare occurrence has been reported in the past, with only a few documented cases of craniopagus parasiticus worldwide. This type of medical condition is extremely rare and poses significant safety risks to the surviving twin. Immediate and careful medical intervention is necessary to preserve the life of the surviving twin. The success of this operation once again highlights the expertise and dedication of the medical professionals and staff at the Guangdong Maternal and Child Healthcare Hospital. These medical professionals have received widespread recognition for their exceptional care and innovative procedures. According to the hospital, the baby's condition was carefully monitored before and after the surgery, and doctors and other medical professionals worked tirelessly to ensure that the baby received the best possible care. The parents of the baby are said to be overjoyed with the success of the operation and are deeply thankful to the medical professionals who were involved in the procedure. This successful surgery is not only a testament to the skills and abilities of the medical professionals involved but also to the incredible resilience and strength of the baby boy who underwent this complex and delicate procedure. The entire medical community is united in wishing him a speedy recovery and a bright and healthy future.
