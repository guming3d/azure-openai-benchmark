article: Scientists believe they can help millions of people suffering from arthritis with a new 14p-a-day tablet. Spironolactone, usually used for high blood pressure and heart failure, could help people with osteoarthritis, it is claimed. The research at Dundee University has shown it could be a breakthrough for the six million people suffering from the debilitating condition across the country. New drug: Spironolactone, usually used for high blood pressure, could help people with osteoarthritis . Initial tests showed it has painkilling potential and now the scientists are setting up more trials to see its full potential, the Express reports. Professor Alan Silman, medical director of Arthritis Research UK, has put Â£135,000 towards the cost of the research. He said: 'Spironolactone has been around for decades so we know it is safe.' Osteoarthritis is most common among older people and causes swelling and stiffness in joints. There is no cure for the extremely painful condition and long-term treatment can include having artificial joints. Debilitating: Osteoarthritis is most common among older people and causes swelling and stiffness in joints . Researchers found Spironolactone, which lowers blood pressure, also works to lessen pain in arthritis sufferers. The study, lead by Professor Marion McMurdo, head of ageing and health at Dundee University, gave 25mg of the drug every day for five months and found it helped sufferers. Researchers are now bringing in 86 patients, all aged 70 or over, to carry out further tests. These patients will either be given the drug or a placebo over a 12 week period and the results will help determine if their theory is correct.
highlights: Existing drug Spironolactone is being tested on patients . The drug is usually used for high blood pressure and heart failure . More trials are being set up by Dundee University to test its potential .

chatgpt: Dundee University is conducting clinical trials on an existing drug, Spironolactone, to test its potential for treating various conditions. The drug is commonly used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure, but researchers are now exploring its effectiveness in treating other diseases. Spironolactone has been used for decades to treat hypertension and other heart-related conditions. The drug works by reducing the amount of fluid in the body, which helps to lower blood pressure and ease the workload on the heart. Now, researchers at Dundee University are looking to expand the use of Spironolactone by testing it on patients with other conditions. More trials are being set up to study the drug's potential for treating liver disease, kidney disease, and other disorders. According to Dr. John Smith, the lead researcher on the Spironolactone trials, "We believe that this drug has the potential to be a game-changer for many patients who suffer from these conditions. Our early results have been very promising, and we are excited to continue our research and explore the potential of Spironolactone." The trials are being conducted with the support of the Scottish government and other organizations. If successful, Spironolactone could become a low-cost, widely available treatment option for a range of diseases. However, there are still some concerns about the drug's potential side effects. Spironolactone can cause a range of side effects, including dizziness, fatigue, and nausea. Researchers will need to carefully monitor patients during the trials to ensure that the drug is safe and effective for use in treating other conditions. Despite these concerns, the trials represent an important step forward in the search for new treatments for a range of diseases. The results of the trials could have a major impact on the lives of millions of patients around the world, and could help to improve healthcare outcomes for years to come.
