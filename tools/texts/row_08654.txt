article: What's black and white, slightly seedy and yours for about £1.50? Meet the newest creation from McDonald's in China, a pair of burgers that could almost be a pun on the ancient Yin-Yang symbol. While some have questioned the rationale behind the multi-coloured meat feast, it appears the answer may lie in a Chinese saying. Double the fun? The burgers are certainly eye-catching, but some have claimed their appeal ends there . 'Heibai liangdao tongchi' is an expression to describe someone who 'eats from both sides' - meaning they have friends high-up in Government (the white side) and in organised crime - referred to in China as 'black society'. According to local website The Beijinger, 'the black burger has a black pepper sauce with bits of onions. The white burger was harder to place, but the sauce has a spicy kick with a sweet finish.' Bun pun: The black and white  burgers are apparently a reference to a Chinese saying . Not all those who tried to burger combo thought it was a hit, and the website Beijing Cream posted a tongue-in-cheek review claiming it 'looks - and tastes - like hell.' 'I would sooner eat a century egg bathed in stinky tofu with a chicken-foot garnish than order this again,' the mystery blogger declared. A deal for the burgers is available via McDonald's website in China, the Huffington Post reported. The set meal costs £2.60 (RMB27), but the set of burgers by themselves cost £1.55 (RMB16).

chatgpt: A new burger with black and white buns has been released in China, but it seems like not everyone appreciates the pun behind it. The black and white buns are said to reflect the colors of the Chinese idiom 'yi hei yi bai', which means 'everything' or 'all sorts of things'. However, one blogger has claimed the meal 'looks - and tastes - like hell'.  The unique burger is currently available at KFC outlets across China for a limited time only. It features a black and white bun with a beef patty, egg, lettuce, and a sauce that is said to have a spicy kick. The black bun gets its color from squid ink, while the white bun is believed to be made with bamboo charcoal.  Despite its eye-catching appearance, one blogger was not impressed with the new creation. "It looks like poop - and it tastes even worse than it looks," the blogger wrote. "I couldn't even finish one bite."  The blogger's review has generated mixed reactions on social media, with some claiming the burger is actually quite tasty. "I tried it and it's not bad," one user commented. "The black bun is a bit strange, but I thought the taste was decent."  Regardless of whether you love it or hate it, the black and white burger is certainly making headlines in China. It remains to be seen whether KFC will continue to offer the unique creation beyond its limited run.
