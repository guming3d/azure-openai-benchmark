chatgpt: In a shocking turn of events, a 31-year-old woman, Jennifer Wilson, was arrested early Thursday morning in Lafayette, Louisiana. Authorities conducted a drug raid at Wilson's residence, and she has been charged with drug possession with the intent to distribute. But that's not all. Wilson faces even more charges related to child neglect. It has emerged that she allowed her 10-year-old daughter to get a tattoo from an unlicensed artist, 31-year-old Brandon Brown. Brown, who has also been arrested, has been charged with unlawful tattooing and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. According to police reports, Brown admitted to providing tattoos without a proper license. He claimed to be "very clean" with his customers, but this is little consolation to the parents of the young girl who received the tattoo. Making matters even more disturbing, Brown reportedly used an ink mixed with human ashes for the tattoo he gave to the minor. This revelation has sent shockwaves through the community, raising concerns about the health and safety implications of getting tattoos from unlicensed individuals who may not follow proper hygiene protocols. The authorities have emphasized that tattooing minors without parental consent is illegal, and that getting a tattoo from an unlicensed artist is extremely risky. They are warning the public to be vigilant and to only get tattoos from licensed professionals who follow strict cleanliness and hygiene protocols. Meanwhile, Wilson's daughter has been removed from her care and is receiving medical attention for the tattoo she received. The investigation into this case is ongoing, and more charges may be brought against the individuals involved. This disturbing incident is a stark reminder of the dangers associated with unlicensed tattoo artists, and the importance of being aware of the risks before getting a tattoo. The tattoo industry is heavily regulated for a reason - to protect the health and safety of individuals who choose to get inked.
