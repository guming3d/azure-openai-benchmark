The computer is attached to a motor which is activated when the owner of the device gives it the ‘drop treat’ command from a remote computing device. A removable sleeve inside the device houses the treats, and one treat is pushed out by the motor arm each time the motor is activated. Software for the system is also run in the cloud, allowing an owner to log in to a personal account. According to the iCPooch team, an estimated 13 million dogs suffer from separation anxiety, as well as many pet owners. The company has launched a Kickstarter campaign, looking to raise $75,000 and has so far received over $7,000 towards its goal.

chatgpt: A teenager from Washington has created a new invention that may help ease the anxiety of dogs who suffer from separation anxiety. Brooke Martin, the inventor, has created a device called iCPooch that is powered by a Raspberry Pi computer on the internet.  It is estimated that around 13 million dogs suffer from separation anxiety when left alone at home, causing them to become anxious, bark excessively or even damage furniture. Now, with iCPooch, owners can ease their furry companions' anxiety by using their smartphones to video chat with them, allowing them to see and talk to their owners remotely. Martin, a high school senior, came up with the idea when she saw how distraught her dog was when she had to leave him alone at home. Her invention has been praised by animal experts and owners alike. They claim that iCPooch is an easy and affordable way to help dogs cope with separation anxiety that can also make owners feel more connected to their pets. The simplicity of Martin's prototype is what sets it apart. The device is quick and easy to set up, requiring only an internet connection and a smartphone. Martin believes that by putting this technology within owners' reach, dogs with separation anxiety can now benefit from meaningful interactions and stay connected with their owners even when they are miles away. The iCPooch is designed to complement the existing tools that veterinarians use to help dogs with anxiety, such as anti-anxiety medication and dog training. In an interview, Martin stated that her device is a way to improve the lives of dogs who would otherwise be left alone for long hours, as well as give owners peace of mind, knowing that their furry friends are not stressed or panicking when left alone. For dog owners, hearing your pet's bark of joy or seeing their tail wagging at the sight of your video call can be emotional and rewarding, especially when you can't be there in person. According to Martin, the iCPooch is not intended to replace human interaction or even dog sitters, but it provides a cost-effective and reliable solution for dog owners who need to leave their furry friends at home alone. The project has gained significant traction, and there are plans to evolve the iCPooch from prototype to product, making it available for dog owners worldwide. Martin plans to continue to improve her invention to help more anxious dog owners give their pets the attention and care they need. In conclusion, the iCPooch may help address the needs of millions of dogs who suffer from separation anxiety. With this technology, owners and their pets can benefit from meaningful interaction, and it's an affordable solution that could help alleviate the stress of leaving your furry friend alone. Martin's invention is a testament to how technology can help improve the lives of our pets and provide peace of mind for owners.
