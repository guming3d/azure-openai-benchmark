article: (CNN)  -- Census-takers are fanning out across Sudan this week in a landmark headcount meant to determine how to divide power and wealth in the war-weary African nation. A south Sudanese soldier keeps watch, with the threat of civil war still high in the war-torn country. The census is a key component of a 2005 peace agreement that ended a 22-year civil war which killed 2 million people and displaced an estimated 4 million others. The war pitted a government dominated by Arab Muslims in northern Sudan against black Christians and animists in the south. Delays in starting the census were among the reasons cited when southerners withdrew last year from a government of national unity. They rejoined the government two months later, but tension and occasional fighting near the disputed territory of Abyei has threatened to reignite the civil war. "God forbid, that's a distinct possibility," said Andebrhan Giorgis, senior policy adviser for Africa for the International Crisis Group, a non-profit organization that seeks to prevent and resolve crisis. "It's quite worrisome." North-south tensions have worsened even as international attention has focused more on persistent violence in the Darfur region of western Sudan, where roughly 300,000 people have been killed since 2003 in a campaign of killing, rape and displacement that the U.S. calls genocide. Results from the national census, which began Tuesday, will be used to establish electoral districts and determine political representation in a national assembly, Giorgis said. "It's an important milestone," he told CNN on Wednesday. The  U.N. peacekeeping mission in Sudan also hailed the census as vital, in a statement Tuesday. The census is key to establishing voting districts in advance of national elections scheduled for 2009. It is also critical in determining how oil wealth is to be shared between the north and south, who have a history of animosity and mistrust. It's unclear how census-takers will operate in Darfur - and how accurately they will be able to count the population there, Giorgis said. E-mail to a friend .

chatgpt: In a landmark effort to determine how power is shared in the war-torn country, census-takers have fanned out across Sudan this week for a headcount. The count is expected to provide critical data for making political, economic and social decisions in the country. Officials hope the census will help prevent conflicts and ensure better governance. Data from the headcount is expected to be used in allocating resources and political power in Sudan, which has long been plagued by political instability and civil unrest. The count will also play a role in deciding the country's future political system. The count comes at a time of mounting tensions between the north and south, which is threatening to plunge Sudan back into civil war. Although a peace deal was signed in 2005, North-South tensions have continued to simmer, and the situation remains volatile. The north and south have long been divided by disputes over resources, borders and political control. The census-takers will pay close attention to these factors, gathering data on the country's population density, education levels, employment, health conditions and other indicators of well-being. Many Sudanese are optimistic about the census, believing it will help promote reconciliation and help prevent future conflicts. The headcount is being carried out with the support of the United Nations, which is providing technical assistance and funding for the effort. The headcount is expected to take weeks to complete, with census-takers traveling to remote parts of the country to reach out to people who may have been missed in previous counts. The process will be challenging, given the country's vast and often difficult-to-reach terrain. Despite the challenges, however, officials are optimistic that the count will be a success. Ultimately, the success of the census will depend on how well the data is used by policymakers and the Sudanese people. If the information is used to promote reconciliation and peaceful coexistence, the census will have played a critical role in helping Sudan move forward. However, if the data leads to further conflict and violence, the headcount will be seen as a missed opportunity for progress.
