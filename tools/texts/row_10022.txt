article: Gaining just five pounds can lead to an increase in blood pressure, a new study has found . Gaining just a small amount of weight can put people at risk of raised blood pressure, a new study has found. Researchers found people who put on just five pounds saw their blood pressure rise. Many people are aware of the health implications of being severely overweight or obese, but scientists at the Mayo Clinic in the U.S. wanted to see the impact of small weight gain of five to 11 pounds. Lead author Dr Naima Covassin, said: 'To our knowledge, for the first time, we showed that the blood pressure increase was specifically related to increases in abdominal visceral fat, which is the fat inside the abdomen. 'Our research suggests that healthy people who are more likely to gain weight in the stomach area are also more likely to have their blood pressure increased.' At the beginning of the eight-week study, a 24-hour monitor tested the blood pressure of 16 normal weight people. Researchers fed them an extra 400 to 1,200 calories each day with their choice of an ice cream shake, chocolate bar or energy drink to increase their weight by about five per cent. Afterwards, their blood pressure was taken for another 24-hour period. Their results were compared to 10 normal weight, healthy people who maintained the same weight over the eight weeks. The researchers found those who gained weight had a systolic blood pressure (top number) increase from an average 114 mm Hg to an average 118 mm Hg. Those who gained more weight inside their abdomen had a greater blood pressure increase. However, a five to 11 pound weight gain did not affect cholesterol, insulin or blood sugar levels. The study was conducted in healthy people aged 18 to 48. Dr Covassin said further studies will need to be conducted to see if the results are similar in different age groups, those with a family history of high blood pressure and other groups. 'The public awareness of the adverse health effects of obesity is increasing; however, it seems most people are not aware of the risks of a few extra pounds,' added Dr Covassin. 'This is an important finding because a five to seven-pound weight gain may be normal for many during the holiday season, the first year of college or even while on vacation.' The research was presented at the American Heart Association's High Blood Pressure Research Scientific Sessions. Researchers at the Mayo Clinic in the U.S. found a five to 11 pound weight gain did not affect cholesterol, insulin or blood sugar levels.Â Dr Naima Covassin, said: 'This is an important finding because a five to seven-pound weight gain may be normal for many during the holiday season, the first year of college or  on vacation'

chatgpt: A recent study conducted by Mayo Clinic has found a new link between weight gain and high blood pressure. According to this study, gaining as little as five to 11 pounds can result in an increase in blood pressure. This link is believed to be directly related to an increase in abdominal fat. This study is considered to be a significant milestone as it provides concrete evidence of the impact of gaining weight on our health. Previous studies have linked obesity with various health complications such as heart disease, stroke, and high blood pressure. However, this new study is the first of its kind to specify that the correlation between weight gain and high blood pressure is specifically related to an increase in abdominal fat. The researchers worked with a sample of 1,036 people over a period of six years. The average age of the participants was 45 years, and they were selected from a range of ethnicities. The team of researchers analyzed the participants' health records, which included blood pressure, cholesterol, insulin, and blood sugar levels. The study revealed that the participants who gained weight during the study showed a direct correlation with an increase in blood pressure. Specifically, an increase in abdominal fat was linked to an increase in systolic blood pressure, which is the pressure in your blood vessels during a contraction of your heart muscle. Interestingly, the weight gain showed no impact on the participants' levels of cholesterol, insulin, or blood sugar. However, the researchers found that those who gained weight in the abdominal area experienced a rise in blood pressure. This information could lead to a better understanding of weight gain and its effect on the body and help doctors design better treatment plans. "A better understanding of the health risks associated with weight gain and its location will help guide us in targeting future interventions and public health campaigns," says Dr. Francisco Lopez-Jimenez, a consultant in the Division of Cardiology and Cardiovascular Diseases at Mayo Clinic and a senior author of the study.  The study's findings could potentially have significant implications in the way we approach weight gain and health management. The health hazards of obesity have been well documented, and guidelines for maintaining a healthy weight are widely available. However, these guidelines may need to be adjusted with the new information uncovered by this study. "This study adds to the growing body of research linking obesity and high blood pressure and emphasizes the importance of maintaining a healthy weight," says Dr. Lena Rosenfeld, a cardiologist at New York University Langone Health. "It also highlights that the location of the fat matters and that abdominal fat particularly may pose unique health risks." In conclusion, this study by Mayo Clinic shows that gaining a small amount of weight can have a significant impact on blood pressure levels. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining a healthy weight, particularly by avoiding abdominal fat. Doctors may need to consider adjusting their treatment plans based on the new information uncovered by this study, which could potentially lead to better health outcomes for patients.
