article: New York (CNN) -- A 111-year-old New Yorker who had been certified as the oldest man in the world has died. Alexander Imich died Sunday morning at a senior residence in Manhattan, his niece, Karen Bogen, confirmed to CNN. Imich was certified as the oldest man in the world this April by the Gerontology Research Group of Torrance, California. "He was remarkable," Bogen said. "He was so independent until very recently, and he just had an incredible curiosity about life." Imich was born in Poland on February 4, 1903, according to a longtime friend in New York, Michael Mannion. He and his wife, Wela, fled Poland when the Nazis took over, survived a labor camp in Russia and in 1951 moved to the United States, Mannion said. His wife, who was a prolific artist and therapist in New York, died in 1986, according to Bogen. "His apartment was filled with her artwork," she said. They had no children. Mannion told CNN that when Imich learned he was the oldest man in the world, he "enjoyed the attention." "It was his work that he was most proud of, and he was happiest when the attention included his scientific work," Mannion said. Despite a doctorate in zoology, Imich's passion was investigating paranormal activity, Mannion said. He detailed his encounters with the supernatural in "Incredible Tales of the Paranormal," a journal that was published when he was 92. While Imich's lengthy life can be attributed to diet, exercise and nutrition, Mannion says his great passion and curiosity for life were the real keys to his longevity. "He had such an ability to turn adversity into something positive. That intense curiosity was there until the last days," said Mannion, who had visited Imich the night before he died. A 116-year-old Japanese woman, Misao Okawa, is the world's oldest living person, according to the Gerontology Research Group. The title of world's oldest man now goes to Sakari Momoi, also of Japan, who was born just a day after Imich in 1903, the group said. Live to 100: Numbers of centenarians has doubled .

chatgpt: Alexander Imich, a 111-year-old New Yorker who held the title of oldest man in the world, passed away peacefully on Sunday. Imich, a published author with a doctorate in zoology, had lived an incredible life full of challenges and triumphs. Born on February 4, 1903, in CzÄ™stochowa, Poland, Imich witnessed some of the most significant events of the 20th century. He fled Poland when the Nazis took over and spent time in a labor camp in Russia during World War II before eventually migrating to the United States. Despite facing adversity throughout his life, Imich never lost his optimism or thirst for knowledge. He became a respected parapsychologist and was fascinated by the concept of the afterlife. In 1995, at the age of 92, he published a book titled "Incredible Tales of the Paranormal: Documented Accounts of Poltergeist, Levitations, Phantoms, and Other Phenomena." While Imich's death is a great loss, his legacy and teachings will live on. He once said, "I didn't plan to be this old. It just happened. I am grateful for each day that I am given." With Imich's passing, the title of oldest man in the world now belongs to 111-year-old Japanese citizen Sakari Momoi. Momoi, who was born on February 5, 1903, just one day after Imich, has expressed his love for Japanese calligraphy and poetry throughout his life. Momoi, like Imich, has lead an extraordinary life full of hardships and achievements. He worked as a teacher until he was in his 60s and later became a principal, a job he held until he retired. Despite living in different parts of the world and enduring vastly different experiences, Imich and Momoi serve as inspirations to us all. Their long, meaningful lives remind us that anything is possible and that age is just a number.
