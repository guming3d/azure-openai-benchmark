article: The locals complain that they are being swamped by wealthy city dwellers buying second homes in their seaside enclave. But the buy-up looks likely to continue after St Ives in Cornwall was voted the most sought-after place to live in Britain. According to a poll by property website RightMove, people believe St Ives would be the most ideal location to reside in. Scroll down for video . Trouble in paradise: St Ives in Cornwall has been voted the place we'd all most like to live - but the locals are not happy, because it means they can no longer afford to live in their own town thanks to investors . The coastal locations of Poole, in Dorset, and Brighton came second and third, followed by the historic cities of Edinburgh and York. Liverpool and Harrogate also scored highly, followed by Bristol, Cardiff and Dartmouth. St Ives families say they cannot buy homes in their community because outsiders have flooded the market and sent prices rocketing beyond their grasp. Last month, locals called for all future new-build homes to be restricted to permanent residents only. The proposal was contained in a draft version of the St Ives neighbourhood development plan, which they hope will be voted into local planning regulations next year. Andrew George, the town’s Lib Dem MP, said high numbers of holiday homes in Cornwall meant some areas became ‘ghost communities’ in the winter when holidaymakers returned to their main residence. He said: ‘Without a doubt, high numbers of second homes do have a detrimental impact on the opportunities for local families to buy.’ But while many dream of living by the sea, others simply want to live near a good pub. The RightMove survey found that being within walking distance of a pub was more important than being near a park or supermarket when choosing where to live. If money was no object, people would choose a detached house with three bedrooms, one kitchen, two living rooms, two bathrooms, a garden and a utility room. Miles Shipside, a RightMove analyst, said: ‘While we gave people the chance to choose a home fit for royalty, on average they said they would be happy in a more modest home with plenty of space and practical features, instead of rattling around in a massive mansion. ‘This shows that the perfect home for many is one that they know they could possibly live in one day, depending on where they are looking to buy, rather than a pipe dream.’ Idyllic: But St Ives' Lib Dem MP said high numbers of second homes were having an impact on residents .

chatgpt: A seaside resort in the UK has come on top of the poll by the property website RightMove, but the locals are not celebrating the achievement as they can't afford to buy properties in their own town. The survey results have caused an uproar among the residents, who are demanding a new law to ensure that only permanent residents can purchase homes. The RightMove poll named the seaside resort as the most desirable place to live in the UK, beating out other popular destinations such as Bristol and Edinburgh. According to the report, the town boasts a picturesque location, a bustling town center, and a wide range of amenities. However, the locals argue that the poll is misguided as it merely highlights the attractiveness of the town to buyers from outside the area. They claim that this has contributed to a housing crisis, as supporters of the survey race to purchase properties, driving up the prices beyond the reach of the average resident. The proposed solution to the problem is a new law that would allow only permanent residents to purchase homes in the area. The campaigners claim that this would help to protect the town's unique heritage and local atmosphere, as well as making it more affordable for those who live and work in the area. They argue that the current situation is unsustainable and threatens the future of the town, as well as the livelihoods of its residents. The move has been met with mixed reactions, with some arguing that it could have unintended consequences, such as reducing the number of properties available for sale, and stifling economic growth. Others have pointed out that the government has already introduced measures to help local residents buy homes, such as shared ownership schemes and first-time buyer support. Despite the criticism, the campaigners remain optimistic about the prospects for their proposed law. They believe that it is a necessary step to protect the town and its residents from the worst effects of the current housing crisis. They also hope that it will encourage other towns and cities across the UK to take similar action to protect their housing markets and ensure that they remain accessible to local residents. The debate over the proposed law is likely to continue for some time, as both sides seek to make their case. However, it is clear that there is a growing sense of urgency around the issue of housing affordability, and that many residents are beginning to demand more action from their local authorities and governments to address the problem.
