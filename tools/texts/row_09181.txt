chatgpt: Kansas City's Schlitterbahn amusement park has set its sights on the ultimate thrill ride with the construction of Verruckt, a towering slide that will be available for daredevils to ride this May. Recently released video footage shows some vertigo-inducing images of the ride being built, offering a glimpse into what may be the world's most insane water slide. The slide's name, Verruckt, is German for insane, and it’s not hard to see why. At a whopping 168 feet in height, the equivalent of a 17-story building, Verruckt is guaranteed to provide riders with a breath-taking experience. Its top deck, made entirely of railroad cars, towers over the Kansas City skyline, providing unparalleled views of the surrounding area. However, the ride is not for the faint of heart. Riders will have to climb 264 steps to reach the top of the gigantic slide. Once atop, the real test of courage begins. Thrill-seekers will rush down the chute at a speed of about 65mph before ascending yet another five-story hill. Those who dare to take on the ride will be rewarded with an unparalleled adrenaline rush and the satisfaction that comes from conquering one of the most thrilling experiences any amusement park can offer. According to Schlitterbahn management, Verruckt will be only the latest addition to a long line of cutting-edge attractions at the park. Once operational, it is expected to smash the current record holder, Insano, which is just half the size but holds the record for being the world’s tallest water slide. Insano is located in Brazil and measures over 130 feet tall. Verruckt's height, combined with its steepness and breathtaking speed, is expected to make it the new king of thrill rides. The ride is the result of months of careful planning, design, and construction, during which the Schlitterbahn team worked to ensure the ride offered a world-class experience to those brave enough to try it. In addition to its impressive height, Verruckt’s design is unique in that it replaces the usual water pumps and other mechanical systems found in more traditional water slides with a straightforward, gravity-based system. Despite the accompanying risks that accompany such a dangerous ride, the Schlitterbahn management team is committed to providing a safe and secure experience to all riders. Strict safety protocols have been put in place to ensure that thrill-seekers can enjoy the experience without any undue risks. These protocols include ensuring that all riders wear appropriate safety equipment, that the slide is properly maintained, and that all riders are sufficiently prepared and briefed before they begin their descent down the twenty-storey slide. The opening of Verruckt promises to be an "insane" event, attracting a worldwide audience eager to test their nerves on what promises to be a truly unforgettable experience. As Schlitterbahn's management team continues to work on the ride's final touches, one thing is clear: this is one ride that shouldn't be missed by anyone seeking a genuine thrill. The world’s tallest water slide is set to open its doors in May, and riders are counting down the days. With Verruckt set to take the world by storm, it’s clear that the age of the traditional waterslide has come to an end, and a new era of cutting-edge amusement park thrills is just beginning.
