The system analyses the history automatically to ﬁnd out about abnormal intake and warn the owner if necessary. It also provides better food suggestions for cat owners to keep their cats in shape. Owners can even watch their cats feeding in real-time via the app. ‘It's like having a full-time nanny taking care of your kitties,’ 42Ark says. The idea came about after the Bistro’s creator, Mu-Chi Sung, discovered that his pet cat Momo developed pancreatitis and had stopped eating. But the realisation came late, as Mr Sung’s other pets had been eating Momo’s food while she was wasting away. The product is currently in the middle of a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo with 29 days left to go. The gadget has an expected retail price for £175 ($299) but early backers can order Bistro on Indiegogo now for half the price.
