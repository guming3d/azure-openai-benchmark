Whitney's phone started it's long journey across the globe back in October 2013, when the farmer accidentally lost the phone in a grain pit on his Chickasha farm. 'I had it in my pocket and I bent over to work on a copper bottom door and it fell out of my pocket into my grain pit and went up the elevator,' he told KFOR. 'I thought "I'll never see that phone again,"' Whitney also said. Whitney went out and got a new phone the next day, while his bin of 280,000 pounds of grain was moved to another Oklahoma grain facility, down the Arkansas and Mississippi Rivers and then to a Louisiana depot where it was loaded on a ship bound for Japan's Hokkaido island. It was at the Zen-Noh Grain Corporation processing facility in Japan that that mill worker found the phone and sent it back to America.

"I knew if that was my phone, I'd probably want it back," said Slater, who added it's not uncommon for cellphones to accidentally fall into grain shipments. "Frankly, I field about a phone a month."
