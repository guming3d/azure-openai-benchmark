article: Gaborone, Botswana (CNN) -- Public servants across Botswana are in the fourth day Thursday of a strike that is expected to last until April 29. The strike began after the mediator between the five unions representing civil servants and the Directorate of Public Service Management gave the unions the go-ahead to strike. The workers are seeking a 16% salary hike. The government of President Ian Khama has not increased civil servants' salaries for the past three years. It is estimated 90,000 government workers out of a total of some 103,000 have been staying off the job. It has been reported that 50 doctors at Princess Marina Hospital in Gaborone, the southern African nation's capital, have also joined the strike. This is in addition of hundreds of health workers, including nurses, across Botswana who have been off the job. There are reports that some schools in the country have closed because of the absence of teachers and cooks. But despite the five unions' threat to paralyze border posts, it has been business as usual at Ramokgwebana border post throughout this week. Members of the Botswana Defence Force were deployed there to render service that is usually offered by immigration officers. The soldiers were apparently inducted on Sunday to man the border for the duration of the strike. They manned the offices in full military uniforms, allowing travelers in and out of the country. This action, seen as disregard of strike rules agreed upon by the Directorate of Public Service Management, has incensed the unions. "This is a clear contravention of strike rules, especially Section 37 of the Trade Dispute Act, which says an employer cannot replace (people) on strike before 14 days elapses. The government does not respect the rule of law," charged Ketlhalefile Motshegwa, secretary general of the Botswana Land Boards Local Authorities and Health Workers Union, who was making the rounds to assess the situation in the northeast. Meanwhile, Khama and his Cabinet went on leave Monday after the adjournment of Parliament last Friday. Some union members have complained this shows the president is not taking their plight seriously.

chatgpt: In a move that has rocked the government of Botswana, nearly 90% of its employees have gone on strike. The workers are seeking a 16% pay raise, after their salaries have been stagnant for the past three years. The strike action which started last week, has affected several government services, including health care, education, transportation, and administration. People across the country are feeling the impact of the strike with many services at a standstill. While the government has promised to implement measures to address the workers' grievances, negotiations have so far failed to yield any results. The public service union has said the strike would continue until their demands are met. Many workers in Botswana are barely making ends meet following years of stagnant wages, rising costs of living, and high levels of unemployment. The workers have argued that the government has not done enough to address these issues, and the current COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated their situation. The strike has also come at a time when Botswana is dealing with a struggling economy, and the government is struggling to fund its various programs, including healthcare and infrastructure development. Nevertheless, workers are determined to push on with their demands, saying they will not back down until they see a change in their circumstances. The impact of the strike has been felt in various sectors, with hospitals and clinics experiencing a shortage of doctors and nurses. Schools and universities have also been affected, as teachers refuse to report to work, forcing students to stay at home. Transport services have been hit, as workers try to force the government to prioritize their demands. The government has said it is doing all it can to address the workers' concerns, including holding meetings with union representatives and consulting with other stakeholders. However, the workers have said they will not back down until their demands are met and have vowed to continue with the strike action. In conclusion, the situation in Botswana remains tense as the strike action by government employees continues. While the government has promised to address the workers' concerns, the strike has caused widespread disruption to public services, leaving many people frustrated and uncertain about the future. However, the workers have vowed to continue with their action until their demands are met, setting the stage for a possible protracted showdown between government and employees.
