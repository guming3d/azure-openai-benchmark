'At the time I was angry - being a student a $480 fine was something I didn't need,' the student said. 'But in truth torrents are illegal. UNSW Wi-Fi isn't meant for torrenting.

The 27-year-old said that although the series is now available legally on subscription TV, he was not planning watch it through this method. 'The only thing that would ever stop me is if my home ISP – Optus or Telstra or whoever – fined me sufficiently.' There has been a string of UNSW students and staff fined in recent years for breaching the Universities acceptable internet use policy. The 27-year-old UNSW student said 'The only thing that would ever stop me (from pirating) is if my home ISP - Optus or Telstra or whoever - fined me sufficiently' Anti-piracy groups such as Electronic Frontiers Australia have questioned the principles of the Universities fines, since the profits are used for student amenities, rather than going to the right holders. Michael Kirby-Lewis, UNSW's chief information officer, said the use of funds towards student amenities ensures the university will not look at the fines as a source of revenue. Downloading is not a fine in Australia, however offenders can be sued large sums by own the content. This month, new legislation was brought into parliament that allows telecommunications companies to provide customer data to rights holders, in a bid hunt down Australians who are alleged to have breached piracy laws.

chatgpt: The University of New South Wales (UNSW) has announced that they will be issuing $1000 fines to anyone who breaches their internet rules. The university's crackdown on illicit downloading comes as the latest measure to curb piracy and promote ethical practices. However, the move has not been without some backlash from students and anti-piracy groups. One student, in particular, has spoken out against the new internet rules. After being fined $500 for illicit downloading, the student stated that he intends to continue with his online pirating activities until he receives a "sufficient fine." The student's defiance has drawn mixed reactions from fellow students and faculty members at UNSW. While some students see the fines as an unnecessary measure, the university has defended its decision, citing the need to maintain ethical and legal practices among its student body. The fines collected will also be used to fund student amenities such as sports and recreation facilities, which have been a long-time concern for many students at UNSW. However, anti-piracy groups have criticized UNSW for using the fines to fund student amenities. They argue that using the funds to support facilities that students already pay for through their tuition fees sends the wrong message about the seriousness of piracy and its impact on the creative industries. In response to the criticisms, UNSW has pointed out that piracy is a serious issue that affects not just the creative industries but also the entire economy. The university hopes that its strict internet rules and fines will help to educate its students on the consequences of piracy and encourage them to become responsible digital citizens. Overall, the use of fines to curb piracy at UNSW remains a contested issue. While some students believe that the fines are excessive and unfair, the university has emphasized the importance of promoting ethical and legal practices among its students. As for the student who plans to continue online pirating until he receives a "sufficient fine," it remains to be seen how his defiance will be dealt with by UNSW authorities.
