The Russian dissident President Vladimir Putin ‘fears the most’ made a triumphant return to Moscow yesterday. In scenes reminiscent of the end of the Soviet era, Alexei Navalny, 37, was greeted by thousands after being dramatically freed a day after being sentenced to five years’ hard labour for what he claims are trumped-up charges of embezzlement and fraud. Navalny, who a judge ruled should remain free until he has exhausted all his appeals, immediately vowed to challenge Putin for power. Vow: Alexei Navalny address supporters upon arrival at Moscow's Yaroslavsky railway station, where he promised to challenge Putin . ‘Together we are a huge powerful force and I am glad we have started realising this,’ he told cheering supporters at Yaroslavsky railway station after stepping off a train. Pumping his fist in the air, he added: ‘Let’s fight for political power in the country.’ Riot police at the scene had earlier demanded the crowd disperse after a suspected bomb was discovered on a platform. Navalny is first planning to challenge the Kremlin’s candidate for Moscow mayor in elections in September. Reunited: Navalny, embraces his wife Yulia, as he was released in a courtroom in Kirov, Russia on Friday . ‘We are going to run and we  will win,’ Navalny told his supporters. ‘If it wasn’t for you,  I wouldn’t be standing here for the next five years.’ Navalny, an anti-corruption lawyer, came to prominence  with a blog accusing Putin’s power base of being ‘the party of swindlers and thieves’. Two years ago he claimed the Russian president’s regime was so corrupt that Russia could face an Arab Spring-style revolt within five years.

chatgpt: Alexei Navalny, an opposition leader and anti-corruption blogger, has been sentenced to five years in jail for embezzling timber. The court found him guilty of misappropriating funds while working on a state-owned project back in 2009. The court also ruled that Navalny had organised a scheme in which two firms embezzled 16 million roubles ($500,000) worth of timber.  Navalny, who is a thorn in the side of Russia's President, Vladimir Putin, has always maintained his innocence and has called the charges politically motivated. After the verdict was announced, Navalny was taken into custody in a packed courtroom, surrounded by his supporters and journalists. His wife, Yulia Navalnaya, collapsed in tears, while Navalny waved and blew kisses to his supporters before being taken away. Shortly after the verdict was announced, Navalny's supporters began protesting outside the court. Dozens of people were arrested, including Alexei's brother Oleg Navalny, who has been sentenced to three and a half years in prison for the same case. However, the very next day, Navalny was released on bail. The judge suspended the prison sentence while Navalny's lawyers appealed the decision. Navalny's release came as a surprise, but it did not dampen his spirit or his desire to fight corruption in Russia.  Navalny has promised to fight on and challenge Putin's leadership. He has already made several appearances on Russian television, where he has accused Putin and his supporters of corruption and stealing from the state. The case and sentence have, however, drawn criticism from international observers, including the US and the EU. Many have accused Putin's government of using the legal system to silence its critics. Navalny's case has become a symbol of the battle against corruption in Russia, and his release on bail has given his supporters renewed hope that change is possible.
