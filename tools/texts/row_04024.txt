article: By . Mark Prigg . Drinking frequently could improve your social standing, researchers have claimed. Researchers studied the drinking habits of people in Toronto, and said that in men in particular, heavy drinking appeared to earn them more respect. For women, any drinking seemed to result in a higher social status. Jon Hamm's character Don Draper in Mad Men famously drinks his way through the series. Now researchers say drinking frequently could improve your social standing, researchers have claimed. Drinking in excess kills about 88,000 people a year, according to the CDC. It says one in six U.S. adults binge drinks about four times a month, consuming about eight drinks per binge. Although college students commonly binge drink, 70% of binge drinking episodes involve adults age 26 years and older. Binge drinking is associated with many health problems, including an increased risk of injuries, alcohol poisoning, STDs, unwanted pregnancies and liver disease. Drinking too much, including binge drinking, cost the United States $223.5 billion in 2006, or $1.90 a drink, from losses in productivity, health care, crime, and other expenses. Dr. Tara Dumas, a postdoctoral fellow at Canada's Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, studied 357 young adults in Ontario between May and July 2012. They asked participants how much binge episodes - which included the number of drinks consumed, and how often these episodes happened - influenced their opinions of friends. 'We used field methodology to recruit young adults' natural drinking groups,' the team wrote in a paper be published in the October issue of Addictive Behaviors. 'For men, more frequent heavy drinking was related to higher peer-nominated status. 'For women, more drinking in general was related to higher peer-nominated status.' The team so found that during binge drinking episodes, those who could drink the most emerged with the highest social status. 'For women, more drinking in general was related to higher peer-nominated status,' the researchers said. 'More consumption during heaviest drinking occasion also predicted higher status. 'Further, for both men and women, drinking more than one's peers during one's heaviest drinking occasion in the past year was also associated with higher status.' The team say the researcher could influence alcohol awareness programmes. 'These findings suggest that higher social status is associated with riskier drinking patterns and have important implications for prevention programming.

chatgpt: A recent study conducted by researchers in Toronto has revealed that drinking habits have a significant impact on the social status of both men and women. The study found that for men, heavy drinking was associated with higher levels of respect, while women who drank at all tended to have a higher social status. The study surveyed a diverse group of people in the Toronto area and asked them about their drinking habits and their perceptions of others who drank. Men who reported heavy drinking were viewed as more confident and assertive, and were often admired by their peers. However, women who were seen drinking at all, whether heavily or not, were viewed as more "fun" and sociable.  These findings are indicative of the pervasive culture of gender roles that exist in many societies, and the ways in which drinking is viewed through a gendered lens. For men, drinking is often seen as a sign of masculinity and social status, while women who drink are viewed as flouting societal norms and expectations.  However, these findings may also be indicative of larger trends in society, such as the ways in which men and women are socialized to view alcohol differently. Men are often encouraged to view alcohol consumption as a rite of passage and a symbol of maturity, while women are often discouraged from drinking due to the social stigma associated with drunkenness and promiscuity.  The researchers hope that their findings will contribute to a greater understanding of the ways in which alcohol consumption is viewed by different segments of society, and the ways in which these attitudes may impact social status and relationships. They recommend further research in this area in order to gain a more nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between gender, alcohol, and social status.  These findings also have potential implications for public health policy, particularly in terms of the ways in which drinking is marketed and targeted to different segments of society. If heavy drinking is associated with higher levels of respect and admiration for men, this could contribute to a higher prevalence of alcohol abuse and related health issues among men. Similarly, if any drinking is associated with higher social status for women, this could contribute to a normalization of drinking behavior among women, which could also have negative health consequences.  Overall, this study sheds light on the complex relationships between gender, alcohol, and social status, and highlights the ongoing importance of understanding these relationships in order to promote health and well-being for all individuals.
