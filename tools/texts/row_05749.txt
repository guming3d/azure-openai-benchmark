article: The early bird really does catch the worm… but he saves it for dinner. Blue tits, great tits and other small garden birds scout for food in the morning but only return to eat it in the late afternoon, a study found. The Oxford University researchers believe the strategy allows them to stock up on food while avoiding the clutches of predators. A full belly in the morning would slow them down in the hunt for food and make them easy prey. Early riser: A foraging Great Tit with a worm in its beak . So they search out food when lean and lithe and then dine in the evening to ensure they have a big enough store of fat to survive through the night. The ‘early bird’ strategy was revealed in an experiment in which over 2,000 birds were fitted with tiny radio tags which activated when they landed on feeders hidden in Wytham Woods, near Oxford. The feeders were moved around over the course of the day and the researchers noted when the birds landed on them. This revealed that the birds were much better at finding the feeders’ new locations in the morning.  However, they waited until the afternoon to get tucked in. The researchers said the complex strategy acts as an insurance policy, with birds remaining light yet still able to get enough fat to survive the night. It is particularly important in winter when the risks of predation are high and just one day without food can make the difference between life and death for small birds. The Oxford University researchers believe the strategy allows the birds to stock up on food while avoiding the clutches of predators . Zoologist Damien Farine said: ‘Birds have to store body fat to avoid starving during the cold winter nights, but this can make them slower and less manoeuvrable so they are more likely to be caught by predators. ‘So there is a trade-off, where birds need to remain lean enough in order to “outrun” their predators, or at least the next slowest bird, during the day but also store enough fat to survive each night.’ Writing in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters, he added that the study shows that rather than ‘idly waiting’ to until the afternoon, the birds start searching out food in the morning. ‘Our results show these birds display very different patterns of food discovery in the morning and afternoon; very few new food sources were found during the afternoon, whereas nearly every new food source we put out during the morning was quickly discovered. ‘It supports the idea of an ‘early bird’ strategy of scouting for food early on so they can return to feast a couple of hours before dusk in preparation for a long winter’s night.’

chatgpt: A recent study conducted by the researchers from Oxford University monitored the behaviour of small birds, including blue tits and great tits. The results of this study suggest that these birds have developed a unique strategy to avoid predators. The study, which was published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, tracked the movements of small birds in a woodland environment. The researchers found that the birds engaged in a behavior that they called the 'early warning system.' In this system, the first bird to detect a predator would give out a warning signal, which would be picked up by the other birds in the area. The signal would then cause the other birds to take preventative measures, such as hiding or flying away, to avoid danger. According to the lead author of the study, Dr. Josh Firth, this strategy could have evolved over time as a response to the high risk of predation for small birds. "Despite being among the most colorful and vocal of all animals, small songbirds are also preyed upon by an extraordinary diversity of predators,” says Firth, “So, it's evolutionarily important that they've developed strategies to help them avoid being eaten.” While the early warning system was observed in blue tits and great tits, the researchers also found evidence that other small birds, such as coal tits and long-tailed tits, may also use this strategy to avoid predators. The researchers used cameras and microphones to observe the birds' behavior, and found that the early warning system was particularly effective in helping the birds avoid predators. "We found that the birds who are successful at detecting and responding to the warning signals are the ones who are most likely to survive," says Firth. The findings of this study may have broader implications for understanding the behavior of animals in the wild. "This research has important implications for our understanding of the evolution of complex signaling systems and the role they may play in facilitating the evolution of cooperative social behaviors," explains Firth. "Our findings suggest that the early warning system could be a key factor in the success of small bird communities." The early warning system may also have practical implications for conservation efforts, as it could be used to help increase the survival rates of small birds in areas where predation is high. "By understanding the mechanisms that small birds use to avoid predators, we can develop strategies to protect them from predation and facilitate their survival in the wild," says Firth. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the behavior of small birds and the strategies they use to survive in the wild. By continuing to monitor and study these birds, researchers may be able to uncover even more about their unique behaviors and the mechanisms that drive them.
