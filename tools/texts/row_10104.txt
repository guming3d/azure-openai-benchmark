article: (The Frisky) -- Yesterday independent film's glitterati bundled up in their sweaters and ear muffs for the start of the Sundance Film Festival. And since we all know that today's Sundance movies are tomorrow's breakout hits and the movies we'll all be betting on come next year's award season, here are eight movies on the lineup that have me salivating. Here's hoping they'll be in theaters soon. "Project Nim": Back in the 1970s, scientists conducted an experiment an a young chimp named Nim. If they raised him like a human, would he learn to communicate using sign language? In this doc, brought to you by the guy who made the amazing "Man on Wire," you'll find out how it went down -- and say "awwww" a bunch. "Meek's Cutoff": We adore Michelle Williams and this movie sets her on the Oregon trail in 1845. It'll be a quiet movie, but we predict that with Michelle in the lead, bonnets will become the new cool girl thing to wear. "Higher Ground": Vera Farmiga isn't just one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood, in my humble opinion -- she's also the smartest. This flick is her directorial debut, about a woman who spends 20 years in a fundamentalist commune and finally decides to leave. "The Future": We love Miranda July, so will forgive the fact that the plot of her new movie -- a 30-something couple slowly falls apart -- sounds an awful lot like "Blue Valentine," only with brown, curly hair rather than blondes. We also hear that it's narrated by a cat? "My Idiot Brother": We're still so glad that Paul Rudd's beard was grown for a movie and not just because. In this comedy, Paul stars as the slacker brother of three uber-ambituous sisters, played by Elizabeth Banks, Zooey Deschanel, and Emily Mortimer. "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold": Morgan Spurlock, the man who ate Big Macs for science in "Super Size Me," takes on the world of product placement in this new doc. The twist? The movie is funded by the products you see in it. "Like Crazy": Long-distance relationships are rough. Like, really hard. This movie, which already has some great buzz going, tells the story of a young couple that meets in college and then has to split when one of them has to return to the UK. "Red State": Kevin Smith's publicity stunt for his new religious horror film is ... that he won't be doing any publicity for it. Oh, and he'll be auctioning off the rights. Put in a bid on Sunday.

chatgpt: In the entertainment industry, there is always something new to watch, read or listen to. Three movies that have caught the eye of many viewers are Project Nim, Meek's Cutoff, and My Idiot Brother. Project Nim is a documentary-style film that tells the story of a group of scientists who conducted a fascinating experiment on a chimpanzee named Nim. The researchers raised Nim like a human child, teaching him sign language and giving him human-like experiences. The aim of the experiment was to test the chimp's ability to learn and use human language. The movie takes viewers on a journey through Nim's life, highlighting the ups and downs of the project. It is an intriguing story that raises questions about the ethics of animal testing. Meek's Cutoff, on the other hand, is a fictional take on the Oregon Trail experience in 1845. The movie follows a group of settlers who are trying to make their way through the desert to the Oregon Territory. They are led by Stephen Meek, a guide who has promised to get them safely to their destination. However, as they travel deeper into the wilderness, tensions rise, and the settlers begin to question Meek's competence. The film is shot beautifully, with stunning landscapes and a haunting score, and Michelle Williams gives a standout performance as one of the settlers. Lastly, My Idiot Brother is a comedy that stars Paul Rudd as Ned, a slacker who has just been released from jail for selling marijuana to a uniformed police officer. Ned goes to live with his three sisters, Miranda (Elizabeth Banks), Natalie (Zooey Deschanel), and Liz (Emily Mortimer), and chaos ensues. Each sister is dealing with her problems, and Ned's laid-back attitude exacerbates the situation. However, as the story progresses, Ned learns that he is not as clueless as his sisters think, and they come to appreciate him for who he is. In conclusion, Project Nim, Meek's Cutoff, and My Idiot Brother are three movies that offer vastly different experiences. Project Nim is a thought-provoking documentary that explores the limits of animal intelligence, while Meek's Cutoff is a beautifully shot and tense drama that captures the danger and uncertainty of early American settlers. My Idiot Brother is a hilarious and heartwarming comedy that reminds us that family is essential, no matter how dysfunctional they may be.
