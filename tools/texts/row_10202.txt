article: Under-fire Australia coach Ewen McKenzie resigned a few hours before the Wallabies were beaten 29-28 by world champions New Zealand in Brisbane, the Australian Rugby Union (ARU) said in a statement. McKenzie, who took over from Robbie Deans just over a year ago, had come under pressure over the last two weeks for his role in the row over offensive text messages Kurtley Beale allegedly sent to a team official in June. He was forced to deny he had been involved in an intimate relation with Di Patston, the official in question, and faced the accusation that he had lost the support of senior players over her role with the team.

'I did not ask Ewen to resign, but understand his decision. He informed me this morning of his intention to resign, regardless of tonight's result,' ARU chief Bill Pulver said in a statement.

chatgpt: Ewen McKenzie, the former head coach of the Australian national rugby team, has stepped down from his position amidst a text message scandal. McKenzie had been under pressure following his alleged involvement in a text message saga that involved Kurtley Beale and a team official in June of last year. The controversy originally erupted after Beale called a team official a "clown" in a text message exchange, which led to an investigation. McKenzie was criticized for not taking a strong enough stance against Beale's behavior and for allegedly leaking information to the media about the investigation. "What's happened to Ewen over the last two weeks is pretty disappointing," said Bill Pulver, CEO of the Wallabies. "I understand the pressure that he's been under, and the relentless media scrutiny that comes with it. But ultimately, we have to do what's best for the team, and Ewen felt that he couldn't continue in his role as head coach." McKenzie replaced Robbie Deans as the head coach of the Wallabies in August of 2013. Under his leadership, the team had some notable successes, including a series win against the British and Irish Lions in 2013. However, in recent months, the team has struggled to maintain its form, with a string of losses against top-ranked teams such as South Africa and New Zealand. The final blow for McKenzie came during the recent game against the All Blacks at Suncorp Stadium. The Wallabies were leading 28-22 with just seconds remaining when New Zealand scored a dramatic try to level the score. As the crowd erupted, the look on McKenzie's face said it all - he knew that his time was up. "It's a tough time for everyone involved," said Pulver. "But we have to look ahead and focus on the future. We have an incredibly talented group of players, and we're confident that we'll find a new head coach who can lead us to success on the world stage." The search for a new head coach is already underway, with several high-profile candidates rumored to be in the running. Whoever takes on the role will have big shoes to fill, but will also have the full support of the Wallabies and their fans behind them.
