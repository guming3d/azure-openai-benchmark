article: (CNN) -- Surveillance footage shows other minors inside a Georgia high school gym at about the same time authorities say Kendrick Johnson suffocated in a rolled-up mat while reaching for a sneaker, an attorney for the school told CNN on Friday. The attorney's acknowledgement came in a response to a CNN open records request asking whether other minors were recorded in the footage inside the Lowndes County High School gym on January 10 between 1:09 p.m. and 1:20 p.m., a span of about 10 minutes after Johnson entered the gym. "I answer your pointed question with 'yes,'" L. Warren Turner Jr.. the attorney, wrote in the letter. CNN made the request after the school declined to release certain surveillance photos or video, citing state law that exempts the release of "education records of a minor child." It's the latest revelation in a case that has seen Kendrick's parents challenge the account of authorities and demanded an inquest into the teen's death. Attorneys for Kendrick's family have called for the release of the surveillance video. Kendrick Johnson's parents want answers . Johnson, 17, was found dead at the gym in Valdosta on January 11, his body resting headfirst in the rolled wrestling mat, according to authorities. A few still pictures, taken from surveillance cameras at the gym, are perhaps the last known images of Kendrick alive. They show him walking across the bare floor. Those images were released by the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office. The next pictures of the teenager are far more horrifying: His body, clad in jeans and layered orange and white T-shirts, is wedged in the wrestling mat. His face is bloated with pooled blood, some of which poured out of his body and soaked his dreadlocks and spilled onto the floor. A pair of orange-and-black gym shoes were found a few yards from the teen's body. A Georgia Bureau of Investigation autopsy found that he died from positional asphyxia, and the sheriff's office determined the death was accidental. Second autopsy: Kendrick Johnson's body stuffed with newspaper . The sheriff has declared the case closed, and the U.S. Justice Department said in September that it wouldn't open a civil rights investigation. But Michael Moore, the U.S. attorney for the district that includes Valdosta, is reviewing the case and weighing whether to open his own investigation. Dr. Bill Anderson, the private pathologist hired by Johnson's family to conduct a second autopsy, found that Johnson had a blow to right side of his neck "consistent with inflicted injury." A January 25 report by the Valdosta-Lowndes County Regional Crime Laboratory cited "no signs of blunt force trauma on Johnson's face or body." And the original autopsy results released by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation May 2 identified "no significant injuries." Johnson's death no accidental, family's autopsy finds . CNN's Greg Botelho and Devon Sayers contributed to this report.

chatgpt: A shocking incident took place in a high school gymnasium in Georgia, which has left the community grieving over the loss of a young life. Kendrick Johnson, a 17-year-old student, was found dead inside a rolled-up gym mat in January of 2013. Now, officials have announced that Johnson suffocated in the mat, which was stored vertically behind some gym bleachers. The incident took place at the Lowndes High School gym, and according to surveillance footage captured, Kendrick Johnson was alone inside the gym before his death. However, in recent news, a CNN open records request uncovered that there were other students in the gym with Johnson before the tragedy struck. Admittedly, the school's attorney acknowledged the footage that reveals other students were present in the gym on the day Kendrick Johnson was killed. However, exactly how many students were in the gym, and what they were doing at the time of the incident, is still unclear. The Johnson family has been fighting for justice since they learned of their son's death. The previous cause of the teenager's death, which was declared by local officials, was positional asphyxia. The theory was that Kendrick Johnson had climbed into the mat to retrieve his shoes and got stuck. However, the family has never accepted this reasoning and has alleged that foul play was involved in their son's death. The discovery of the surveillance footage has since re-opened the possibility of negligence or even conspiracies. The family's attorney has argued that the footage contradicts the idea that Kendrick Johnson was alone in the gym, as it was previously believed. Moreover, the footage raises more questions into investigating what happened the day Johnson died. Despite the family's allegations, a federal investigation into the teenager's death was closed without any findings of wrongdoing or irregularities. Furthermore, two Georgia brothers, who were classmates of Kendrick Johnson, filed a defamation lawsuit after their names were mentioned in several social media posts alleging they were involved in Johnson's death. However, this lawsuit was later dropped. For the Johnson family, however, the fight for justice is far from over. Marcus Coleman, the family's spokesman, argued that the school district "purposefully withheld the full video and fought tooth and nail" to avoid releasing it to the public. The family has since demanded the release of any other potentially relevant recordings and the re-opening of Kendrick Johnson's case. The details surrounding Kendrick Johnson's death remain shrouded in mystery, and the recent release of footage with new information has left the community questioning what really happened inside the gym that day. Many are hoping for a break in the case that brings justice to the Johnson family and finally uncovers what truly led to the tragic death of this promising young student.
