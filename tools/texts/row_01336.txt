article: (CNN) -- If there were any doubt that the members of the Monty Python troupe wouldn't be holding back in their farewell show, it came with a rousing version of "Every Sperm Is Sacred." The performance of the "Meaning of Life" song included a whole range of props, including cannons in the shape of phalluses. And what's the point of bringing out phallus-shaped cannons if you're not going to, uh, set them off? Python has always been equal parts deadpan and silly, highbrow and low, and the "Monty Python Live (Mostly)" show -- which concluded Sunday at London's O2 Arena and was simulcast all over the world -- highlighted those distinctions. Among the sketches performed by the group were the Yorkshiremen, in which the four attempt to one-up each another in remembering horrible childhoods; "Crunchy Frog," in which John Cleese's inspector challenges Terry Jones' confectioner over some interesting chocolate creations; and, of course, the "Parrot Sketch," which was combined with the "Cheese Shop" sketch, allowing Cleese and Michael Palin to indulge in their fondness for synonyms and euphemisms. In that one, Cleese and Palin seemed to be having a particularly good time, stepping on each other's lines in high-spirited confusion. Cleese also got in an impromptu knock against a British newspaper editor. The "Monty Python Live (Mostly)" show has gotten decent reviews (mostly) during its three-week run, many praising the group for its contribution to comedy if lamenting the casualness of the live production. The final show was apparently little changed from the debut, with its many musical numbers and occasional hesitations. There were a couple special guests for the final show -- Eddie Izzard and Mike Myers -- and physicist Stephen Hawking, who joined a videotaped skit, was in the live audience. Nevertheless, if the group didn't break any new ground, then again, it didn't have to. "It gives the crowd exactly what they want but relies pretty heavily on the fan love and makes a hefty withdrawal from the reputation bank," wrote The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw when the show debuted. In a not-quite-full Atlanta theater where the show was simulcast, fans cheered their favorites, anticipating the Spanish Inquisition and singing along with "The Lumberjack Song." There were a couple audio glitches at the beginning, but for the most part it was an enjoyable afternoon, with the show functioning more as a celebration of Python history than a demand for new material. Indeed, fans looked on the bright side of Python all over. In Calgary, Alberta, a storm knocked out the audio, but the audience simply started a singalong. As the show came to a close, two frames came up on the O2's big screen: "Graham Chapman 1941-1989," in memory of the late Python member, and "Monty Python 1969-2014." If this is indeed the end, Python can go out knowing its legacy is secure. And that's not so completely different.

chatgpt: The legendary British comedy group Monty Python, performed their final live show on Sunday, in front of a packed audience at London’s O2 Arena. Broadcasted live to cinemas worldwide as part of a special simulcast, the event was titled "Monty Python Live (Mostly)". Although the group has been inactive for over 30 years, their humor and wit still resonates, and this last performance was a chance for many fans to catch a glimpse of the beloved comedians. The event kicked off with the classic Python tune “Always Look on the Bright Side of Life,” as Eric Idle, John Cleese, Michael Palin, Terry Gilliam, and Terry Jones took the stage. The opening act brought the audience to their feet, cheering and clapping with excitement as the group poked fun at aging and their mortality. Throughout the show’s two-hour runtime, the group revisited some of their most famous skits, including their iconic “Dead Parrot Sketch”, “The Spanish Inquisition”, and “The Lumberjack Song.” While the group's chemistry and comedic timing were still as strong as ever, "Monty Python Live (Mostly)" didn't break any new ground. Despite its lack of innovation, Python completists and nostalgic fans alike reveled in the event, soaking up every moment of the last performance they would ever see from the group. There were, however, some new elements to the show, including the addition of audience favorites “Four Yorkshiremen" and "Bruces’ Philosophers' Song”. The group made a point to break out of their usual routines and interacted with the audience frequently, perhaps in an effort to inject some fresh energy into the final show. During the song “I Like Chinese”, Terry Gilliam, and Terry Jones emerged in Chinese costumes and had some fun dancing with the backup Chinese dancers. John Cleese and Michael Palin performed a sketch about competitive walking, which brought a good laugh from the audience. The show ended with the classic tune “Always Look on the Bright Side of Life,” with Idle once again singing the famous lyrics. The group invited a group of dancers on stage to join them in the song, as they all basked in a rainbow of confetti, bringing the curtain down on the four-decade-long career of Monty Python. Overall, "Monty Python Live (Mostly)" was a joyous celebration of the group's work and humor, with the show feeling more like a greatest hits collection. While the group didn't break any new ground, the show did prove one thing beyond doubt: the old gang still had a good time making fun of themselves, and as always, entertaining audiences worldwide.
