article: New York (CNN) -- President Obama accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on Thursday by talking about war and the limits of nonviolence. But he also praised the peacemakers of the past and said the world can and should still strive for peace. "Let us reach for the world that ought to be," he told the 1,000-member audience at Oslo City Hall in Norway. "Clear-eyed, we can understand that there will be war, and still strive for peace." The Nobel committee's choice of Obama as this year's laureate sparked debate, in part because he is a president waging two wars abroad. Obama said force is sometimes necessary, but said that is simply "a recognition of history, the imperfections of man and the limits of reason." Read a transcript of Obama's acceptance speech . Fareed Zakaria, author and host of CNN's "Fareed Zakaria: GPS," spoke to CNN about the speech . CNN: What message was President Obama trying to send the world in his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech? Fareed Zakaria: The speech reflected his basic philosophy, which is why it worked so well. I think Obama is somebody who is a realist-idealist. He tries to balance idealism with the realities in the world. He clearly believes in the idea of doing good in the world, but believes you have to be pragmatic and realizes the dangers of over-reaching. CNN: Will the focus on the Afghanistan war being "just" be well received by world leaders? Zakaria: Most of the world supports the war in Afghanistan. The UN approved it, and over 50 countries are participating one way or another, so countries won't react negatively. Obama wanted to remind people, including those in his own party here in the U.S., that the Afghanistan war has a morally legitimate basis and that there are occasions in history where force is necessary. CNN: Are there any potential pitfalls to spending so much of the speech defending the war on moral grounds? Zakaria: The great danger of moral certitude is that you get distracted from the practical issue of whether things are working. Are we creating a stable government? Are we being successful against the Taliban and al Qaeda? From Woodrow Wilson to Vietnam, the question of whether a military action is morally legitimate can overshadow whether it works. CNN: Does the speech give us any window into how Obama might conduct U.S. foreign policy going forward? Zakaria: The Afghanistan speech last week and the Nobel speech are the two clearest statements of his worldview. He isn't making a broad statement like President Bush, when he vowed to end tyranny in the world. Obama says the U.S. is a force for good, but is engaging with the world and is trying to avoid open-ended commitments. Obama wants the U.S. to play a world role that is progressive and idealistic, but remains aware of the practical limitations inherent in trying to operate in a messy world.

chatgpt: In a recent speech by President Barack Obama, he highlighted the importance of balancing idealism with the realities of the world. According to renowned journalist Fareed Zakaria, the president’s address showcased a nuanced understanding of the moral case for war and the effective military mission it requires. Zakaria, host of CNN’s “Fareed Zakaria GPS,” praised the president for taking a measured approach to foreign policy. He explained that the president recognizes the need to match idealistic goals with practical strategies that can actually achieve them. One of the most notable examples of this approach came in Obama’s Nobel Prize acceptance speech in 2009. Zakaria noted that the president used the speech to make a powerful case for American exceptionalism and the role the country plays in promoting global peace and security. But he also acknowledged that the U.S. has made mistakes, and that the ideals it champions must be backed up by actions that are consistent with those ideals. Similarly, in a speech on Afghanistan in 2009, Obama emphasized the need to balance competing priorities in the region. He recognized that the U.S. had an obligation to promote democracy and human rights, but also acknowledged that there were practical limits to what could be achieved through military force. Zakaria pointed out that the Afghanistan speech, along with the Nobel address, presented a clear picture of the president’s worldview. He explained that Obama’s approach to foreign policy is grounded in a belief in the power of American ideals, but also recognizes the complexities and limitations of the world. This nuanced approach to foreign policy has drawn criticism from some quarters. Some argue that the president’s focus on ideals leaves him vulnerable to charges of naivete, while others argue that his practical approach has led to a lack of progress in key areas. Zakaria, however, sees things differently. He believes that Obama’s approach represents the best possible way to navigate the complex world of international politics. The president’s emphasis on ideals, he argues, provides a clear vision of what the U.S. stands for, while his practical approach ensures that those ideals can actually be realized through effective policy. For Zakaria, the president’s speech is a reminder that foreign policy is a complex and nuanced field. It requires leaders who can balance competing pressures and priorities, and who can navigate the constantly shifting landscape of global politics. Ultimately, Obama’s approach may not satisfy everyone. But Zakaria’s analysis suggests that it represents a thoughtful and nuanced response to the challenges of the modern world. And as the U.S. continues to grapple with a range of complex and interconnected issues, his insights will likely prove invaluable.
