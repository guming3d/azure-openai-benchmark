The 22-year-old England international was allowed to travel to the London club for tests after Cardiff accepted an offer and he officially signed for the club on Tuesday.

chatgpt: Queens Park Rangers have completed the signing of Cardiff City defender Steven Caulker for a reported fee of £8million. The English center-back has signed a four-year contract that will keep him at Loftus Road until 2019.  Caulker was in high demand during the summer transfer window, with several clubs expressing interest in him. Crystal Palace were one of those clubs, and they matched QPR's offer for the 22-year old defender. However, Caulker was swayed by the prospect of playing alongside Rio Ferdinand at QPR, and he decided to join Harry Redknapp's side. "Steven Caulker is a top-class defender, and we're absolutely delighted to have him here," said Redknapp. "He's got all the qualities you need in a center-back: he's quick, he's strong, and he's a great reader of the game. I'm really excited to see him play alongside Rio Ferdinand, and I think they'll form a formidable partnership." Caulker was equally excited about joining QPR, and he revealed that Ferdinand played a big role in his decision. "When I heard QPR were interested and I spoke to Harry Redknapp, I knew this was the place for me," he said. "The chance to play alongside Rio Ferdinand was a big factor too. He's a legend of the game and I'm looking forward to learning from him and playing alongside him." QPR have been busy in the transfer market this summer, and with the addition of Caulker, they have strengthened their defense significantly. Redknapp is also reportedly keen to bring in Troy Deeney from Watford to bolster his attacking options. Deeney scored 24 goals for the Hornets last season and helped them gain promotion to the Premier League. QPR will face stiff competition for his signature, with Crystal Palace, West Brom and Sunderland all expressing interest in the 26-year-old striker. Redknapp is known to be a big fan of Deeney, and he is said to be preparing an offer for the striker. QPR have already spent heavily this summer, with Caulker being their fourth signing following the arrivals of Rio Ferdinand, Jordon Mutch and Mauricio Isla. The QPR boss is determined to build a squad that can compete in the Premier League, and he believes that the addition of Caulker and potentially Deeney will help his side achieve their goals. "We're looking to bring in quality players who can help us compete in the Premier League," he said. "We've made some great signings this summer, and we're looking to make a few more before the window closes." With QPR poised to step up their interest in Troy Deeney and the signing of Steven Caulker already completed, it's clear that Harry Redknapp is not done with his summer shopping just yet. QPR fans will be hoping that the club can continue to strengthen their squad in the coming weeks, and build a team that can hold its own in the Premier League.
