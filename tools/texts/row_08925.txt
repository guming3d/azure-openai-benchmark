article: (CNN) -- Beset by war and sectarian violence, Iraq has not had a lot to laugh about in recent years. But a trio of old friends from Baghdad have sought to change that, by distilling the jokey banter of their late-night drinking sessions into a controversial talk show. Hosted by Yasser Sami and Walid Monam, and produced by their friend Ghazwan Al-Shawi, the show is called "Akou Fad Wahad" -- "There is this guy" -- the typical setup for one of their anecdotes. The aim behind the production, says Al-Shawi, "was to make people smile." "We wanted to do anything to make miserable and sad people happy," he said. But while it's proved a hit with their predominantly male audience, not everyone appreciates their sense of humor. Sami describes the first episode, broadcast in the summer of 2011, as "very bold." "It got us into a lot of trouble because there was sexual and pornographic innuendos, so it was like a shock for all Iraqis," he laughs. Since then, the show has routinely offended the conservative sectors of Iraqi society with its discussion of taboo topics including relationships and sex. A religious group staged a demonstration outside the show's studio last year, and government censors complained about the content. Read more: Arab female film directors find acclaim . Sami said a gang even turned up at his house, threatening him. "I can't tell you (who) because this means I will give them another chance to come to me again," he laughs. The jokes might not be considered particularly edgy to non-Iraqis -- or even necessarily that funny. A typical gag goes like this: "A stoned guy bought two birds for his mother, one tweeting and the other silent. She asks, 'Son, why is it that only one of them that is tweeting?' 'Mother, the other one is the composer,' he replied." But although the humor may seem mild, Iraq is not yet ready for "Akou Wad Fahad." Sami says the team has had to modify their approach in order to continue broadcasting. "We changed things in the show," he said. "We used to have a female DJ, but we were asked to remove her from the show, and we did." Even in the new Iraq, said Monam, there are still many "red lines" that cannot be crossed in entertainment. "Were it not for the limitations that are imposed on us, it would be a much better show. But we have to live with social taboos," he said. Challenging this, he says, is "impossible," at least for now. But as frustrating as it might be, he and his friends are content to tone down their act, if it means bringing a smile to people's faces.

chatgpt: A new talk show in Baghdad is creating quite a buzz among its predominantly male viewers, although not everyone is a fan of its controversial humor. The show is hosted by three old friends, who have created a unique format that combines risqu√© jokes and sexual innuendo with current events and political commentary. And while their on-air antics have won them legions of fans, they've also drawn criticism from some quarters. Last year, a religious group staged a protest outside the show's studio, citing concerns about the content being broadcast. They argued that the talk show was inappropriate and offensive, especially given its popularity among younger viewers. Despite the backlash, the show's hosts say they're committed to delivering laughter to their audience, regardless of the controversy they generate. In fact, they say that the attention only fuels their creativity and encourages them to push the envelope even further. "We've always been passionate about comedy, and we're not going to let anyone tell us what we can or can't say," one of the hosts said in a recent interview. "If some people find our humor offensive, that's just too bad. We can't please everyone." The show's popularity extends far beyond Iraq, with viewers tuning in from across the Middle East and beyond. And while some may find the content offensive, many others appreciate the humor and view it as a much-needed escape from the often harsh realities of life in the region. "We just like to have fun and make people laugh," another host said. "Life can be serious enough, and if we can help people forget their problems for a little while, then we feel we've done our job." Despite the controversy, the hosts say that they're not planning to tone down their act anytime soon. In fact, they're already working on new material and are looking forward to continuing to entertain their fans for years to come. Whether or not the talk show will continue to generate controversy remains to be seen. But one thing is for sure: its hosts are committed to making sure that their audience never suffers from a shortage of laughter.
