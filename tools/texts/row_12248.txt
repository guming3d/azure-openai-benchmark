article: By . Ryan Gorman . A decorated New York police officer was found intoxicated and nearly naked in a random woman’s apartment earlier this month only hours after receiving the department’s second-highest honor. Four-year NYPD veteran Eugene Donnelly, 27, received the Police Combat Cross June 10 for bravery while off-duty during a shooting. He was then stripped of his gun and shield that evening. Donnelly, stationed in a Bronx precinct near Fordham University, was so drunk he wandered into the stranger’s apartment wearing only his underwear, sources told the New York Daily News.

He went to stay with a friend.’ The officer is believed to have been celebrating in the hours after shaking Mayor Bill de Blasio’s hand while receiving the award in a ceremony at City Hall. Donnelly was staying at a friend’s apartment in Woodlawn, in the northern Bronx, when he somehow managed to leave the residence and ended up inside the woman’s apartment. The woman lived in the same building, and police say she accused him of getting into a physical altercation with her, according to the Daily News. ‘He has an encounter with a female, and she claims he roughed her up,’ a police source said. ‘He was in his underwear when this happened.’ High praise: Donnelly shook Mayor Bill de Blasio's hand as he received the NYPD's second-highest medal for bravery . At attention: The now-disgraced officer stands in formation before the medal ceremony . Melvin Hernandez, spokesman for the Bronx district attorney’s office, told the Daily News his office is looking into the matter. The Internal Affairs Bureau is also involved in the investigation. Donnelly’s defense attorney shot down the claims in comments to the paper. ‘The case is in the beginning of the investigation,’ lawyer Stu London said. ‘When a thorough investigation has been completed, it will be obvious that my client engaged in no criminal wrongdoing.’ Donnelly was awarded the medal just over two years after he arrested a teen gunman terrorizing a Bronx neighborhood in May 2012. He was off-duty while driving with a friend to meet his partner when several men ran from a park while being chased by a gun-wielding Javon Julien. Julien, 19, fired a shot at the men while running past Donnelly’s car. The cop shouted at Julien to stop, but the teen instead shot out Donnelly’s driver’s side mirror. The officer fired back, striking Julien four times before chasing down and arresting him. Julien was given eight years in prison for his shooting spree. The Bronx DA is still deciding whether to file charges against Donnelly.

chatgpt: Eugene Donnelly, a decorated NYPD officer, has been arrested after allegedly assaulting a woman while at her apartment. The incident occurred on June 10, the same day the officer received the Police Combat Cross for his heroic actions during a 2012 shootout with a Bronx teen. According to a police source, Donnelly was found intoxicated and wearing only his underwear when officers responded to a call from a woman who claimed the officer had assaulted her. The woman alleges that Donnelly had forced his way into her apartment, despite her protests. The incident has shocked the city's law enforcement community and raised questions about the fitness of officers serving on the force. While the details of the alleged assault remain under investigation, the NYPD has confirmed that Donnelly has been suspended from active duty as a result of the incident. Donnelly's decorated career in law enforcement has been marked by bravery in high-pressure situations, but this incident has cast a shadow over his legacy. The Police Combat Cross is one of the highest honors bestowed upon officers in recognition of their valor and courage under fire, but the arrest of a recipient of the award serves as a reminder that even the bravest among us are fallible. The NYPD's response to the incident has been swift, with the department releasing a statement condemning Donnelly's actions and emphasizing that the department takes allegations of misconduct seriously. The department also stressed that it will fully cooperate with the investigation into the matter, and that any officers found to be in violation of the law or the department's code of conduct will be held accountable for their actions. The incident has also rekindled a longstanding debate within the law enforcement community about the role of alcohol in the lives of police officers. While most officers are expected to exercise discretion and moderation when it comes to alcohol consumption, incidents like this serve as a reminder that some officers struggle with substance abuse just like the rest of us. For now, Donnelly's future in law enforcement remains uncertain. While he has not been formally charged with any crime, the allegations of assault are serious and could result in significant penalties if proven true. For the department, the incident serves as a sobering reminder that even the bravest among us are not immune to the pressures and pitfalls of modern policing.
