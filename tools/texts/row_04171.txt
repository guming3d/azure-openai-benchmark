article: An Ebola victim who recovered from the deadly disease in Liberia has been quarantined at New Delhi airport - after traces of the virus were found in his semen. The 26-year-old Indian man had arrived at the terminal carrying documents from Liberia confirming he had successfully undergone treatment for Ebola. But although he had been declared free of any symptoms and his blood tests were clear, Indian authorities placed him in isolation after they tested his semen. An Ebola victim who recovered from the deadly disease in Liberia has been quarantined at New Delhi airport - after traces of the virus were found in his semen . India's Health Ministry said three blood samples from the man tested negative for the disease, which means he is considered recovered according to standards set by the World Health Organisation and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC advises Ebola survivors to avoid sex for three months or use condoms because the virus can continue to be found in semen for seven weeks after recovery from the disease. Sexual transmission of Ebola has not been definitively established, though some studies have shown that the virus can persist in semen for longer than in blood or other body fluids. The ministry said the move to isolate the man was taken 'as a matter of abundant caution' and he would continue to be held under isolation at a special health facility at the airport until his body fluids test negative. 'The person concerned is a treated and cured case of Ebola virus disease,' it said in a statement. 'All necessary precautions are being taken at the isolation facility. This would rule out even the remote possibility of spread of this disease by the sexual route.' Ebola has killed more than 5,000 people in the west African countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea (file picture) When the man arrived at the New Delhi airport on November 10, he carried documents from Liberia confirming he had successfully undergone Ebola treatment and had been declared free of any symptoms, the Health Ministry said. He was placed in quarantine as a precautionary measure as authorities tested his blood over the next several days. There have been no Ebola cases reported in India or throughout Asia, but there are fears that an outbreak could spread quickly in a region where billions live in poverty and public health systems are often very weak. Early symptoms of Ebola include fever, headache, body aches, cough, stomach pain, vomiting and diarrhea, and patients aren't contagious until those begin. The virus requires close contact with body fluids to spread so health care workers and family members caring for loved ones are most at risk. Ebola has killed more than 5,000 people in the west African countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.

chatgpt: A 26-year-old Indian man arrived at a terminal with documents that confirmed his successful treatment for a deadly virus. Authorities ran blood tests, which came back clear, indicating that the man was free of the virus. However, they proceeded to test his semen samples, which contained traces of the same virus, thereby raising concerns among the health officials. The deadly virus, which has claimed several lives worldwide, is known to spread through bodily fluids. Without proper treatment, it can lead to severe health complications and even death. Hence, the man was immediately quarantined in a health facility at the airport until his body fluids tested negative for the virus. The health officials were quick to take action to prevent the spread of the disease. They ensured that the necessary medical measures were taken, and the man was given the right medication to help him recover fully. The health facility staff also made sure that they followed the necessary protocols to contain the virus and protect themselves from contracting it. According to World Health Organization (WHO), transmission of this virus through semen is a rare occurrence. However, the recent discovery of the virus in the man's semen has prompted health officials to recommend further testing to investigate its potential as a new transmission route. The WHO also issued guidelines which recommend that men who have recovered from the virus should practice safe sex or abstain from sexual activity for at least three months after recovery. Meanwhile, the Indian man has been receiving the necessary medical attention in the health facility at the airport. He is under the watchful eye of health officials who are monitoring his condition and ensuring that he receives the best possible care to help him recover. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of adhering to medical guidelines and protocols, especially during times of global health threats. The virus has caused widespread panic and fear, and health officials are doing all they can to prevent its spread while also ensuring that those who have contracted it receive prompt and proper medical attention. In conclusion, the discovery of the virus in the man's semen samples is a cause for concern, although transmission through this route is rare. Health officials are taking the necessary measures to investigate this potential new transmission route and prevent the spread of the virus. The Indian man is receiving proper medical attention and is expected to fully recover soon. The incident underscores the importance of following proper medical protocols and guidelines during times of global health crises.
