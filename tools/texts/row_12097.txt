'Dishonest': Carer Monica Owusu (pictured) stole £50,000 by continuing to claim her dead husband's benefits after his death . A widow stole more than £50,000 by continuing to pocket her husband’s benefit payments for nearly three years after his death. Part-time carer Monica Owusu, 50, received £1,895 every month into their joint account, but did not tell the council her husband had died. She used the money to pay bills and her mortgage, a court heard. Owusu was sentenced to thirty weeks in prison, suspended for twelve months, and ordered to complete 80 . hours community service. She was also told to repay the money after pleading guilty to stealing £52,122 from the London Borough of Croydon between September 1, 2007 and May 18, 2010. Sentencing her, Recorder Ian Bourne QC said: 'You withdrew the money and used it for your financial commitments, knowing it did not belong to you and should have been returned to the local authority,' The family home, which she inherited from her late husband, will now be sold to repay the debt. Owusu’s husband received the benefit for home care from September, 2004, but passed away three years later. 'He had required full-time care and was paralysed,' prosecutor Francesca Levett told Croydon Crown Court. 'Monica Owusu was in charge of his finances. 'She informed their occupational therapist when her husband died, but this information did not reach the relevant department and direct payments continued to be made. 'The account continued receiving the payments for months, but it was not until August Mrs Owusu accessed the account and saw the large sum of over £20,000. 'That’s when, the prosecution say, she became dishonest and withdrew large sums without notifying the local authority.' 'Eternal regret': Owusu has agreed to Croydon Council (above) the money back at the rate of £150 a month after pleading guilty to the theft . Eventually, Croydon Council stopped the payments and interviewed the defendant. 'She said she used it to pay bills and her mortgage and said she did not know why she did not tell the local authority. 'All the money was withdrawn. Nothing was left in the bank account.' Owusu, of Oval Road, Croydon, agreed to repay the council at the rate of £150 per month, but stopped after nine payments. Owusu’s lawyer Kwame Inyund said: 'To her eternal regret, she took advantage of the situation with the money she was not expecting. 'There is no evidence of a lavish lifestyle or money taken out of pure greed. 'It is her intention to make good what is owed to the local authority out of the sale of the property.' Recorder Bourne told the first-time offender: 'It is obvious to everyone that you did not set out to steal such a large amount of money from the local authority. 'It was inevitable that you would have been caught one day.'

chatgpt: A part-time carer who used £1,895 a month paid into her joint bank account to pay bills and mortgage has been spared jail after agreeing to pay back the council. Monica Owusu was facing a potentially lengthy prison sentence for fraudulently claiming housing and council tax benefits over a two-year period. The 46-year-old from Swanscombe in Kent had failed to report that she was receiving money from her partner, which led to her receiving more than £19,000 in benefits to which she was not entitled. At Maidstone Crown Court on Monday, Owusu pleaded guilty to two counts of fraudulently claiming benefits. Her defense attorney explained that the £1,895 a month had been paid into Owusu's joint bank account, which she shared with her partner. The attorney said that Owusu had used the money to pay bills and mortgage and that her partner had been unaware that the money was not intended for her personal use. The judge in the case, Simon James, acknowledged that Owusu had not set out to defraud the council intentionally. However, he expressed concern that the council had not been notified about the money that was being paid into Owusu's account. James noted that the council could have revised Owusu's benefits payments had they been aware of the money coming into the account. Despite his concerns, James opted not to send Owusu to prison. Instead, he ordered her to pay back the £19,000 plus £500 in costs to the council within 12 months. The judge warned Owusu that if she failed to meet the deadline, she would face a 16-month jail sentence. Speaking after the hearing, a spokesperson for the council said that they welcomed the judge's decision. They stated that the council had a zero-tolerance approach to benefit fraud and that they would not hesitate to take action against those who sought to cheat the system. Owusu's case highlights the importance of being transparent with the council when it comes to changes in financial circumstances. Failing to report income can lead to overpayments, which can be viewed as fraudulent by the council. It is important for claimants to report any changes in their circumstances promptly to ensure that their benefits are adjusted accordingly. In conclusion, Monica Owusu has learned a valuable lesson from her experience. While she avoided a prison sentence this time, she must pay back the council for the money she received fraudulently. It is important that others take heed of the outcome of Owusu's case and ensure that they report any changes in their circumstances to the council promptly. The council has made it clear that it will take action against those who seek to defraud the system, so it is in everyone's best interest to be transparent and honest.
