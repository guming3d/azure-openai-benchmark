article: Police believe Pratibha Khan, 19, was dragged from her home by her father and brother before being beaten with bricks and strangled to death . A teenage girl was stoned to death in India and had her face 'smashed beyond recognition' by her father and brother after she was caught dating a boy from a neighbouring village. The bloodied remains of Pratibha Khan, 19, were found by friends in the fields near her home in India's northern Uttar Pradesh state. Investigators say she was dragged there by father Jagpal, 65, and oldest brother Pradeep, 36, who were angry she was dating a boy from a nearby village, before being attacked. Officers believe the girl was beaten with bricks and stones before being strangled to death, and that more injuries were inflicted after she had died in an attempt to hide her identity. Alia Modi, 18, a friend of Miss Khan, said: 'I was walking home through the fields when I saw a body lying on the ground. 'It was covered in blood and when I looked at the face it was so badly damaged I didn't recognise it as Pratibha's. It was only later that I learnt who it was and I was simply horrified.' A police spokesman said: 'The post-mortem report showed that while the cause of death was strangulation, it appeared that she had been repeatedly struck by bricks and stones. 'Perhaps to hide her identity, some of the blunt force injuries to her face were made after her death, but most weren't.' 'It looks like the brother and father dragged her to the fields and assaulted her with bricks and stones. They then strangled her and went on to smash her face beyond recognition.' Speaking about the arrests, the spokesman added: 'An analysis of her mobile phone records pointed to the involvement of her family members, in particular the brother and father. 'Initially, her brother Pradeep was questioned and claimed she was killed by her lover. Miss Khan's older brother Pradeep, 36 (left), and father Jagpal, 65, have been charged with her killing. Today another of her brothers, Prabhat, 33, said he was 'neither sorry nor surprised that my sister is dead' 'It was only later when we interrogated Pradeep and his father Jagpal separately that we were able to find inconsistencies in their statements. 'Eventually they admitted that they had killed her because she was in love with another boy from a nearby village.' One of the girl's other brothers Prabhat, 33, said: 'I am neither sorry nor surprised that my sister is dead. If what people say is true, then I am not surprised that my father and brother killed her.'

chatgpt: In a shocking incident, a 19-year-old girl named Pratibha Khan was brutally killed by her own relatives in India's state of Uttar Pradesh. The victim's father Jagpal, aged 65, and oldest brother Pradeep, aged 36, have been arrested in connection with the crime. The police believe that the two men attacked Pratibha with bricks, causing her face to be smashed beyond recognition, before strangling her to death. According to the reports, the incident took place in a village in the Meerut district of Uttar Pradesh. Pratibha, who had been living with her family, had been facing harassment from her family members for a long time. In fact, her own brother has shockingly admitted that he was "neither sorry nor surprised" that she was killed. The police have stated that the motive behind the heinous crime was the victim's romantic relationship with a boy from another community. Pratibha's family members were allegedly against her relationship with the boy and had threatened her multiple times in the past. However, she had refused to end her relationship despite facing opposition from her family. The police launched an investigation after receiving a complaint from the victim's mother, who was reportedly not present at the time of the incident. During the investigation, the police found that Pratibha's father and brother had not only killed her but also tried to dispose of her body by burning it. However, their attempt was unsuccessful, and they were subsequently arrested by the police. The incident has sent shockwaves across the state, with people expressing their anger and sadness over the brutal killing. Many have taken to social media to demand justice for the victim and her family. The police have assured the public that they are conducting a thorough investigation and will ensure that those responsible are brought to justice. This horrific incident is a stark reminder of the prevalence of honor killings in India, especially in rural areas. Honor killings usually occur when a person's actions or behavior is seen as bringing shame or dishonor to their family or community. While the government has taken steps to address the issue, including passing laws to ban the practice, such incidents continue to occur. As the investigation into Pratibha's murder continues, it is important that society continues to come together to condemn such atrocities and demand justice for the victims. The loss of a young life is always tragic, but it is even more devastating when it is at the hands of one's own family.
