article: As the world reels from its worst Ebola outbreak, the nation hardest hit is declaring a shortage of body bags, which are crucial to preventing the spread of the deadly virus. Liberia, one of  three countries most affected by the outbreak, said it has 4,900 body  bags nationwide. It needs 85,000 more in the next six months, the Health Ministry said in a statement. A grim inventory of supplies shows body bags were not the only items lacking. Liberia is also experiencing a shortage of other supplies needed to fight the virus, including protective suits, face masks, gloves and goggles. Liberia said it needs 2.4 million boxes of gloves in the next six months, but it has only 18,000 boxes. Each box has 100 pairs. It also needs about 1.2 million hooded overalls within the same time frame, but it has only 165,000. The numbers are the latest setback in Liberia's fight against Ebola, which has killed at least 2,458 people in the nation. This week, health workers in the nation went on strike to demand higher pay, leaving some clinics unattended. Since the outbreak started in March, about  9,000 Ebola cases and 4,493 deaths have been reported, mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, according to the World Health Organization. More than half of the deaths have been in Liberia. And the numbers are expected to skyrocket. There could be up to 10,000 new Ebola cases per week in the three hardest-hit nations by the end of the year, the World Health Organization said. It warned that things will get worse before they get better. Liberia has some supplies arriving in the next week, but it says they are still insufficient. Items scheduled to arrive don't include body bags. In addition to the three nations, a handful of Ebola cases have also been reported in Senegal, Nigeria, Spain and the United States.

chatgpt: Liberia is currently facing a major challenge in its fight against the Ebola virus. Despite efforts by the country's health officials to contain the spread of the disease, it appears that they are facing increasingly difficult challenges caused by a shortage of critical supplies. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the Ebola virus has killed at least 4,493 people in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, most of whom are in Liberia. This grim statistic highlights the urgent need for more resources and support to combat the deadly virus. Liberia's current lack of necessary supplies is particularly alarming. One of the most critical shortages is protective gear, including suits, gloves, and goggles, which are essential for health workers who are in contact with infected patients. The lack of these items highlights just how ill-equipped the nation is to fight the virus. The situation is particularly concerning as health workers themselves are among the most vulnerable to contracting the disease. Consequently, the shortage of protective gear puts more people at risk of contracting the disease. The government, along with international aid organizations, has been working to provide additional supplies to Liberia's health facilities. However, the shortage of crucial protective items remains an issue. There is a need for an increased international focus on providing vital resources to Liberia to help mitigate the devastating impact of the Ebola outbreak. Despite these challenges, Liberian health officials are committed to continuing their fight against the virus. They are working tirelessly to contain the spread of the disease and treat those who have been infected. Liberia has been hard hit by the Ebola virus, but it is not alone. The international community must continue to provide support to ensure that the resources needed to combat the disease are available to affected regions. With the right supplies and support, Liberia can overcome this challenge and end the toll of the Ebola pandemic.
