'The fridges were open so all of the food in there was gone as well,' said Euan Bryson, a manager at the restaurant. 'The whole scenario is quite peculiar though, all they took out the building is £2.50 from a tip jar and a couple of these vegan sweets.

'There's quite a sinister element to it, at one point in the tape we saw one of them hiding behind the staircase clutching the knife as though he was ready to pounce. 'The knife he had is made in the same way as a Samurai knife, it's very sharp and a viable weapon. 'I hope they are found soon, the local police are very good.'
