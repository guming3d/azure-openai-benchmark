article: Cristiano Ronaldo has been handed a two-match ban for his outburst during Saturday’s 2-1 win over Cordoba. Much to the dissatisfaction of Real Madrid’s title rivals the player will now miss only Real’s home game with David Moyes’ Real Sociedad on Saturday and the home match with Sevilla three days later. He will be available for one of the season’s title deciders away to Atletico Madrid the following weekend. Pressure had been put on the Spanish FA to make an example of Ronaldo after he slapped Cordoba defender Jose Angel Crespo at a corner, then kicked Edimar, and landed another blow on Crespo.

Ronaldo appears to claim there is nothing wrong as the Brazilian defender goes down clutching his face . In a final act of petulance, Ronaldo takes a backhand swipe at Crespo before being shown the red card . But match referee Alejandro Hernandez never saw the first incident and only reported the kick on Edimar in his match report and not the subsequent striking of Crespo. Hernandez’ match report stated: ‘In minute 83 the player Cristiano Ronaldo was sent off for the following reason: Kicking his rival off the ball’. The Spanish FA’s disciplinary committee could have asked Hernandez to elaborate on his report but instead have given Ronaldo the minimum punishment for the digression outlined by the referee. It was Ronaldo’s ninth career red card and he now has eight more than Leo Messi who has never been sent off for Barcelona but was red-carded on his debut for Argentina. The Portuguese international still has some way to catch Zinedine Zidane. The Real Madrid legend currently coaching the club’s B-team was sent off 14 times in his career.

Ronaldo apologised for the sending off on social media after for forgiveness for his moment of rashness, saying: 'I apologise to everyone and especially Edimar for my thoughtless act in the game today'. He is also understood to have said sorry to team-mates in Monday’s training session. Ronaldo’s red mist comes at a difficult time for Real Madrid. They lost the opening league game of the year against Valencia, were knocked out of the cup by Atletico Madrid, have a potential Fifa transfer ban hanging over them, and an improving Barcelona close on their heels. On Saturday they will have to cope without their talisman as Real Sociedad come to the Bernabeu having already beaten Madrid once this season.

chatgpt: Real Madrid's star forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, has been sent off during a match against Cordoba after lashing out at a defender. The incident occurred in the 82nd minute of the game, with the score tied at 1-1. Ronaldo struck Cordoba defender, Edimar, after being fouled by him. The referee had no choice but to show a straight red card to Ronaldo, who left the pitch visibly upset. His absence will be sorely felt by Real Madrid in the upcoming matches against Real Sociedad and Sevilla. Ronaldo's anger seemed to stem from the fact that he felt he was unfairly targeted by the Cordoba defender. However, his actions were deemed unsportsmanlike and heavily criticized by both fans and pundits alike. Following the match, Ronaldo apologized for his conduct in a statement released by the club. He said, "I want to apologize for my behaviour. It was not right and I'm sorry. I'm especially sorry to Edimar for what happened." Ronaldo's suspension will come as a huge blow to Real Madrid, who are currently battling it out with Barcelona for the La Liga title. With just a few games left in the season, every point counts and losing their star forward for two crucial fixtures could see them slip up. Real Sociedad and Sevilla are tough opponents, and without Ronaldo, Real Madrid will have to rely on their other players to deliver the goods. While they have plenty of talented players in their squad, none can match Ronaldo's prowess in front of goal. However, Ronaldo's absence could also present an opportunity for some of the other members of the team to step up and show what they are capable of. Players like Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema, and James Rodriguez will need to be at their best if Real Madrid are to overcome their opponents. This is not the first time Ronaldo has been sent off during his career. However, he has always bounced back from adversity and shown his critics why he is one of the best players in the world. Real Madrid will be hoping that he can continue to do so, and that his absence will not have a significant impact on their title ambitions. In conclusion, Ronaldo's red card during the match against Cordoba was a highly controversial incident. While his actions were deemed unsportsmanlike, the Portuguese star has apologized for his behaviour. Real Madrid will now have to navigate two tough fixtures against Real Sociedad and Sevilla without their talismanic forward, but his absence could also present an opportunity for other players to step up and make an impact. Only time will tell how this suspension affects Real Madrid's La Liga aspirations.
