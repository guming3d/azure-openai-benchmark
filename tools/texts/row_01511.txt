article: Rail passengers could save millions of pounds a year thanks to a secret computer code which finds cut-price fares normally hidden from the public. Founders of the website TrainSplit.com are helping travellers buy cheaper ‘split tickets’. This means that instead of buying one ticket for a journey, passengers can break their trip up into legs – offering a lower combined fare while travelling on the same train. The website’s founders believe rail companies are overcharging passengers on 42 per cent of tickets sold. Rail travellers can save money by using a new website which allows them to buy tickets for each leg of their journey without having to get off the train . And they say their tool can save an average of 22 per cent on the fares listed on train company websites. For example, a single off-peak ticket from Plymouth to Derby can cost £129.50 using the Trainline site. But buying five separate, single tickets for the route costs just £79.80 – a saving of £49.70. Similarly, depending on the hours of travel, a return ticket between Manchester and London can cost £270. But by using TrainSplit.com to find five separate tickets, that is cut to just £179.50, saving £90.50. The train has to stop at the stations where all the tickets are valid to and from, but passengers need not get off. Hereford-based computer programmer Nick Brown, 45, tried for three years to create a search engine to find cheap fares. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin has defended rising ticket prices in the past . But it wasn't until he met rail buff Mark Richardson and his business partner George Sikking that he gained access to the pair’s vast databases of timetables, fares and reservations for the UK rail network. They launched the site last April with freelance software developer Paul Kelly, and it is used by 20 to 30 passengers a day. Mr Brown, 45, said: ‘Before we had access to this massive database, it would take the most hardcore of passengers to actually sit down with the National Fares Manual and go through it to find the cheapest deal. ‘And you can’t stand at a kiosk and ask staff to work out the price of each individual journey. 'They don’t have enough time, and it’s not part of their job.’ Mr Richardson told The Sunday Times: ‘The idea is to take insider knowledge and make it available to the general traveller, so they don’t have to work anything out themselves.’ The four experts now want to extend the service to tickets which include travel on London’s Tube. They are working on an algorithm to show passengers how to buy cheaper fares if they are happy for their journey to take longer. Although it is allowed under the conditions of carriage, train firms have in the past lobbied the government to banish split-ticketing. The MoneySavingExpert.com website also has a split-ticketing search engine, offering only two split legs.

chatgpt: TrainSplit.com: The Website Making Train Travel More Affordable For many people, traveling by train is one of the best ways to explore a new city or even commute to work. However, the cost of tickets can be a major drawback, especially for longer journeys. Fortunately, one innovative website, TrainSplit.com, is making train travel more affordable than ever before. The concept behind TrainSplit.com is simple: by buying tickets for separate legs of your journey on the same train, you can save money compared to buying a traditional single ticket. The way this works is that trains must stop at stations where all tickets are valid to and from. However, passengers don't have to get off, allowing for huge savings on tickets. For example, let's say you want to travel from London to Edinburgh. Normally, you would buy a single ticket that covers the entire journey. But with TrainSplit.com, you could save money by buying two separate tickets - one from London to York, and another from York to Edinburgh. As long as the train stops at York, you can stay on board and continue your journey to Edinburgh. According to TrainSplit.com, the average customer saves around 61% on their train tickets using this method. The website is user-friendly and easy to navigate. To get started, simply enter your journey details and TrainSplit.com will show you a range of options that split the journey into separate tickets. You can then compare prices and choose the option that works best for you. The website also offers a range of other tools to help you plan your journey, such as a seat availability checker and a map of train stations. TrainSplit.com is not affiliated with any train companies and operates independently. This means that you can trust the website to give you impartial advice and find you the best deals. The website also offers a price promise, which guarantees that you will never pay more for your tickets than you would if you bought them directly from the train company. There are a few things to keep in mind when using TrainSplit.com. Firstly, it's important to make sure that the train stops at the stations where you're buying separate tickets. If the train skips one of these stations, you may have to pay extra for a new ticket. Secondly, you'll need to make sure that you have enough time to change trains if necessary. This can be tricky, especially if you're not familiar with the train network. Finally, it's important to note that TrainSplit.com does not currently cover all train companies or routes. However, the website is constantly expanding and adding new options. Overall, TrainSplit.com is a valuable tool for anyone looking to save money on train travel. Whether you're planning a long journey or just need to commute to work, this website can help you find the best deals and make your journey more affordable.
